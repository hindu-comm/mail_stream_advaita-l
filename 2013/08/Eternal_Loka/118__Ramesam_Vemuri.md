"Appayya Dikshitar was doubtful of how deep his devotion to Lord Siva was.
He asked his disciples to make a potion from UmattangAi that will make him
lose control of his mind and speak. In the state of delirium, he composed a
great verse on Lord Siva."

Umatta (Datura sp) is known for centuries as a hallucinogenic and a
deliriant. Its pharmacological effects are now known. It contains tropane
alkaloids and can prove fatal in higher doses. In ancient India, this plant
was considered a favourite of Shiva. Not only in India, in other continents
too it was under use for altered states of the mind like ayahusca,
marijuana etc.
