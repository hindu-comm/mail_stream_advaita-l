No confusion at all. It is only from where one looks at, only matters. When a person is living in the Vyavaharika world he sees the created world and may think about the creator. When a person looks with the eye of a Jivanmukta he can see that there is no creation at all. There is only Brahman and nothing else.

Namaste

I have gone through the messages on this topic. There is big confusion and
doubts here because no body is recognizing Eka Jeeva Vada. If you accept
Eka Jeeva Vada all doubts are cleared.

I am the one and only Jeeva in the Universe. I have created the Universe as
my dream. The Ishwara is in my dream only. The dream is Vyavahara. If I get
Brahma Jnana by studying Upanishads in my dream taught by dream Guru the
dream will end. There is no Ishwara and no Universe when I realize I am
Brahman. What is eternal? When I have the dream Ishwara is there. But when
the dream has ended he is not there. He is in the dream only. Vaikuntha and
Kailasa are in my dream. When dream has ended they are not there. They are
not eternal. Ishwara is not eternal also. Because they are in my dream.
