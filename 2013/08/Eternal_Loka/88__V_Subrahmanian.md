The Chandogya shruti, for instance, says:

‘सन्मूलाः सोम्येमाः सर्वाः प्रजाः सदायतनाः सत्प्रतिष्ठाः’ – ‘Sanmoolãhã
somyemãhã sarvãhã prajãhã sadãyatanãhã satpratishthãhã’ – ‘Whatever
creation can be seen, has all been created from that sat – Brahman.  Also, Sat
is the cause of the sustenance and dissolution of creation’ (Chãndogya
Upanishad: 6/8/4).
Thus, O Shvetketu, that Brahman and Parabrahman are the cause of all. Sat
is the ãtmã of all; Sat pervades all, control all and support all.

The Lord says in the Bh.GitA:
मत्तः परतरं नान्यत्किञ्चिदस्ति धनञ्जय |
मयि सर्वमिदं प्रोतं सूत्रे मणिगणा इव ||७- ७||

"Sri Krishna said: O Arjuna, there is no truth superior to Me. Everything
rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread."

Since the pramAtA is both sat and chit, the prameya is dependent for both
its existence and knowability on the pramAtA consciousness.

Yes.  One is prAtibhAsika mithyA and the other is vyAvahArika mithyA. The
first one is negated in the vyavahAra itself and the second one is negated
from the pAramArthika jnAna.

It is because the nature of the Pure Consciousness of the Upanishad is that
it will not be experienced unless through some or the other upAdhi.  The
body/mind is one such upAdhi through which the Consciousness is
experienced.  'adRShTo draShTA'  'anAshino'prameyasya..' are the shruti and
smRti texts to show that the Pure Consciousness is the unseen Seer and the
one that never becomes a prameya, a viShaya.

Try to delve deeply on the above mentioned concept and you will understand
the vedantic position.

If you study under a qualified Acharya you will get a glimpse of what
Vedanta vichAra is.
