The reason is perfection in vyavahara is not possible.  No matter how much 
one seeks wealth there will always be more to possess outside of your 
grasp.  No matter how much one seeks pleasure there will always be more to 
lust after.  Even in dharma, the heavenly state which is its rewards will 
eventually dissipate returning you to samsaric misery not matter how much 
karma you perform.

Previously, the wise thinkers all over the world believed that the Earth 
was at the center and all the planets moved around it.  Their best models 
were fairly useful but in parts annoyingly unexplained.  More and more 
corrections were made but imperfections remained.  It is only when it was 
realized that the theory was broken and a better idea developed, that the 
planets including the Earth moved around the Sun, that progress resumed.

Advaita Vedanta calls for a paradigm shift away from the assumptions that 
underpin vyavahara.  This is true.  However it emphatically teaches that 
only a particular type of person is qualified for that shift.  It takes 
pains not to cause those are not ready to doubt their understanding and 
assumptions.  It is only in recent times that some irresponsible people 
have started spreading Advaitic teachings in an indiscriminate and 
irresponsible way.

But it does not prepare you for the time when there is no next set of 
karma.

Right but from the age of 8 he kept himself away from having to deal with
vyavahara as much as possible.

Plurality is not infinite.  Not understanding this places you outside the 
camp of Advaita Vedanta.

I can understand why it could be confusing.  That is why it is important 
to be diligent in shravana, manana, and nididhyasana under the guidance of 
a shrotriya and brahmanishta teacher.

Unfortunately that is quite possible given my current time constraints. 
Perhaps we can take it as an illustration of the necessity of having a 
reliable guru. :-)

The key phrase here is "to my current understanding."  The reason we have 
a sampradaya is because each generation adds to the understanding of the 
subject.  It prevents unnecessarily reinventing wheels.

While all of srshti is in and from brahman, brahman is more than that.

This is the same as what is taught in chhandogyopanishad and in 
the purushasukta

pAdosya vishvAbhUtAni tripAdasyAmR^itandivi

(Also  note: brahman is neuter gender in sanskrit so a better 
translation is "it is" even though it looks a bit funny in English.)

So one cannot understand brahman merely by understanding srshti.  In fact 
one will get a misleading view by doing so.  This is why shastra tries to 
separate the concepts of brahman and srshti in the sadhakas understanding.

Nothing wrong with this except it should be noted that the right 
sort of upasana to shiva or vishnu or any other vedic deity will produce 
the same results.

Quite right.
