Hare Krishna. Ishwara dies? OMG! 

In the world of Lord Brahma, there are three tiers for the trimurtis. This world gets destroyed but beyond that is Vaikuntha that is identical to Lord Kesava, whose manifestations are Brahma (Ka), Siva (Isa) and Vishnu (Va) and who are under His control, who are His kesins (saktis). Please read Vishnu Sahasranama Bhashya.

As I have said before, Appayya dikshitar has said that the very same brahma
loka (which too goes into pralaya) appears as shiva loka for shiva upasakas
and vishnu loka for vishnu upasakas.  Still it is not 'eternal'. It is
within creation.

So correct. For pralaya the creatin has to stop first. Next the paalan or nourishment of the creation has to stop. Then 

the destruction takes place. That is why Lord Vishnu's life is longer than that of Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva's life is longer than that of Lord Vishnu.

What is the point in answering the above question? 'Eternal' and fixing a
limit to it are contradictory.

In the Taittiriya up. bhAShyam for the mantra 'asad vA idam agra AsIt'
[2.7.1] Shankara comments:

//By 'asat' avyAkRtam (undifferentiated) brahman which is distinct from the
differentiated distinct names and forms is meant.' This is not absolutely
non-existence, since there can be no effect issuing forth from
non-existence. By the word 'idam' the distinctly experiencable world of
names and forms is meant. Prior to the creation of the distinctly
available world, brahman alone, denoted by the word 'asat' existed.//

From this it is known that during pralaya avasthA the qualified brahman,
the seed of the yet-to-manifest creation, existed. This is Ishwara. We do
not specify a loka, abode, for this Ishwara, for there is no need for such
a specification. All the potential creation is 'in' this Ishwara (which is
itself a mAyA-tinged sentient entity). If it is insisted that an abode be
specified, we can say: it is the nirguNa brahman that is the substratum on
which this Ishwara containing the creation in potential form before
creation, and in manifest form after creation, rests. It should be
remembered that Ishwara is not a person with a definite unchanging form.
It is a concept.

As I have said before, Appayya dikshitar has said that the very same brahma
loka (which too goes into pralaya) appears as shiva loka for shiva upasakas
and vishnu loka for vishnu upasakas.  Still it is not 'eternal'. It is
within creation.
