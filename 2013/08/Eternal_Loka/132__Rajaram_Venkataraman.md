RV: Appayya Dikshitar categorically denies liberation for any jiva until
every one is liberated. If you give up you sthula and sukshuma sarira, you
will become one with Ishwara. This is what he says. This is the eka jiva
vada position.

Are you saying that Ishwara has spatio-temporal limitation in advaita? He
is transcendental to space and time. Ishwara, though maya sabalitha, is
also without body and mind. He is pure consciousness.

much more than I do. It simply means in consideration of. In consideration
of vyavahara, from where bandha and moksha are talked of, you have to admit
Jaimini's view because brahman is what cimes as Ishwara. Neither Badarayana
nor Sankara rank the perspectives of Jaimini and Audulomi. A eka jiva vadin
or bhagavad bhakta will say a jnani becomes Ishwara like Jaimini. A nana
jiva vadin or a jnana yogi will say a jnani realised that I am pure
intelligence (Audulomi). Both will be right because Ishwara is pure
consciousness and vice versa (Bh G 14 27. - please also read Madhusudana).

RV: If you understand that Ishwara is your Innermost Self, how can you drop
Him? Let Sankara say that I (sastras) introduced the concept of Ishwara and
I want you to drop it, then we will drop Him. Ishwara, by definition is
an intelligent being (1.1.4) and you talk of Him as if It is a
non-intelligent pradhana. Does Sankara use such language any where for
Ishwara? We have to keep the spirit of Sankara especially someone like you
who had dedicated your life for Him.

Even logically, how can a true bhakta give up Ishwara? He becomes a bhakta
only after surrendering himself to Ishwara. It is like saying that a girl
given in kanniga dhanam can give up her husband like in modern day
divorces. She belongs to her husband. She may see her husband in every
object as in the description of bhakti by Sankara that you quoted or she
may yearn for him every moment of separation as did gopis when Krishna went
to Mathura. Her love may be powerful enough for her husband to see her in
every object. The husband may give himself to her as did Lord Rama to Sita.
Even if He is her property, she can't give Him up ever. They can at best
become one as did Meera and Krishna.

Did I not point out that the Br.Up.
> precludes the sUkshma sharIra's departure from the jnani's body upon

RV: There is no sukshuma sarira for a jnani who has attained oneness with
Ishwara. Ishwara also does not have sukshuma sarira.

>   Such being the case where is the individuality that will persist
> in/as Ishwara eternally for a Jnani?

RV: There is no individuality (if by that you mean ahankara) for that
Vishnu (Rudra if you will or Shakti) who is beyond all names and forms.

RV: I don't have problem in admitting Audulomi's view that a jnani is
suddha caitanyam. I equally don't have problem in admitting that a jnani is
Ishwara. Only those who see Ishwara as different from Brahman will have
problem with Jaimini's view.

RV: Your argument is like saying that when a pot is destroyed space is
destroyed. Only the dualistic conception of space as one within and outside
is destroyed not space itself. If Ishwara will become non-existent on
moksha as you say, Jaimini will be plain wrong because he says you will be
Ishwara. Following him, Appayya Dikshitar will also be wrong. They will be
right if you accept eka jiva vada.
