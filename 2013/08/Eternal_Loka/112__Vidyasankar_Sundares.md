Rajaram,



It seems to me that the core of Advaita thinking has remained as elusive as ever, for the above question
to be asked in the first place. All this angst over eternality and non-eternality is quite misplaced.



What happens to ISvara / mAyA-Sabalita brahma at pralaya? The answer is, Nothing.



What happens to ISvara / mAyA-Sabalita brahma at the beginning of the next kalpa? Again, Nothing.



At all times, and beyond all time, brahman remains brahman, always nirguNa, always nirviSesha, always
mAyopAdhi-rahita (free from mAyA). It is not as if saguNa brahman is one entity and nirguNa brahman is
another, different entity. It is not as if something called saguNa brahman has to really lose all guNa-s and
merge into nirguNa brahman at the time of pralaya. 



Think about it.



If the mind is not prepared to grasp the vast implications of brahman really and forever being without any
guNa-s, then I'm afraid, discussing advaita is really, really premature. It would be much more useful to leave
these nuances and controversies behind, and concentrate on a specific path of sAdhana.
