Shree Rajaram - PraNaams. 
From my point, what is important is from Adviata position, not from a particular acharya's position. avyaktaa buuta jiivani vyaka madhyaani bhaarataa .. From the advaitic positioncreation itself is from vyavahaara point only. Adviata points out the truth that the duality that we see in creation is mithyaa - That, therefore, includes jiiva-jagat-Iswara traid. Jiiva-jagat-Iswara traid will be there as long as ignorance is there. Knowledge involves understanding that there is no real creation. End of the story, at least for me. 
Hari Om!
