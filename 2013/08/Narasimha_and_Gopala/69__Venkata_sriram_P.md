Namaste Rajaram ji,

The moment you took the name of our beloved Devanathan,
i am choked with emotion.

He was a great scholar and was a great upasaka of shODasha-bhAhu
nArasimha mUrti who was initiated into the secrets of Narasimha upAsana
from none other than Br.Sri.R.Krishnamurty Sastrigal.

He was hardly late 20s or early 30s and it is most unfortunate that
God took him away from us.  

Every time i remember him, i get disturbed. 

Pls see that his papers and manuscripts are published in some good journal.

regs,
sriram
