RV: He is a great person anda devotee of Krisnna and his service to cows is
laudable but some of his interpretations of shastras do not stand the test
of logic. For example, he believes that there is absolutely no animal
sacrifice or even war in vedic yajnas. The introduction of these in smrti
or bhashyas is degradation. I disagree with that and am only concerned with
truth.

RV: There are a some devotees engaged in Krishna lIlA, others in Siva or
Sakti etc. Anyway, the objective of a gaudiya vaishnava is not go to goloka
but to be devoted to Krishna without expectation of results birth after
birth. Sri Krishna Caitanya sings "mama janmani janmanIsvare bhavatad
bhakti ahaituki tvayi" (let me devoted to you birth after birth"
Bhaktivinod sings "kita janma hau jata tuwa dasa bahir mukha brahma janme
nAhi Asa" (expressing preference over birth as a worm devoted to Krishna
rather than as Brahma not devoted). There are many philosophical works of
the acharyas which talk about this.

The existence of an eternal loka within vyavahara is supported by Advaita
tradition also. I have not only read the texts that support it but also
reviewed with Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal.

RV:  In our traditions, there was eclecticism. As Thiruvalluvar said,
"Whoever says whatever, determining the truth thereof is intelligence".
Kalidasa gives a similar quote which Sringeri Periyava quotes.
