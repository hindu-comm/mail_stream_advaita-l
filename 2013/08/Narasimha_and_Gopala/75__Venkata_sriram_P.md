Namaste Rajaram Ji,

////

There is also a commentary on Gopala Tapani Upanishad by
Visveswara, who I think Madhusudana's guru. Other commentaries are by Jiva,
Prabhodananda, Visvanatha and Baladeva

///

I would advice you to meet Mahamahopadhyaya Haridas Sastry Ji Maharaj of Brindavan.  Maharaj is a great krishnOpAsaka and hails from the direct lineage of Rupa Goswami.  He stays in Kaliadah of Brindavan.  An octogenarian who mastered purva mimamsa, jagadisha bhatta & gadAdhara bhatta nyAya in early teens itself.  A great tArkika and vyAkaraNa shAstra paNDita.

Having mastered the entire shAstra, his only sAdhana now is "gO-sEva" right from morning to evening.  He performs the gO-sEva just as King Dilip performed in Raghuvamsam. 

As per gaudiya vaishnavism, there is an eternal gO-lOka and the objective of the gaudiyas is to attain that gO-lOka and participate in "Eternal Rasa Lila" amidst rAdha and kriSNa.  Sri Haridas Maharaj Ji in sUkSma shareeram takes part in this rAsa lila.

You are gauDiya vaishnava and i would advice you to approach Maharaj Ji in Brindavan and seek clarifications.  

Partly reading gaudiya vaishnava siddhAnta and partly reading advaita siddhAnta would create confusion in the mind whose objectives and philosophies are entirely different.

Either you study gauDiya siddhAnta or you study advaita siddhAnta.   

regs,
sriram
