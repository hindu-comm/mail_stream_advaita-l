Namaste,

Acharya Sankara wrote a wonderful commentary on Narasimha Purva & Uttara Tapini Upanishad. 

Padmapada was upasaka of Narasimha who did mantra purashcharana in Ahobilam
and had Narasimha Sakshatkaram.  

Narasimha holds special place in Sankara Parampara especially in Sringeri.  Also, 
all the acharyas of Sringeri worship Narasimha Salagrama.  

Probably, that is the reason Sri Vidyaranya has special affinity towards Narasimha
and it's 32 lettered mantra in anuSTup chandas.  The narasimha dhyAna sloka related to 
this anuSTup chandas is very typical in the sense that the deity is portrayed
as "hari-harAtmaka" ie., though Narasimha is viSNu swarupa, He holds the ayudha
called "pinAka" which is the weapon held by Siva.

The dhyAna sloka itself displays the abhEda tattva between Hari & Hara.

regs,
sriram
