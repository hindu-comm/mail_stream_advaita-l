Shree Rajaram - PraNAms

It is interesting, today we will be discussing the slokas in the panchakosha viveka of the Panchadasi (III:12-16) in our class. In the 16th sloka Shree Vidyaaranya refers to several upanishadic declarations and one ofthe Upanishads referenced is this Narasimha Purvataapani Upanishad besides Bri. Up., Mundaka, Katha, and swetaswatara) - this is with reference to Swayam joyti aspect and also the illumination of the entire universe. This is the first time I heard about this Upanishad. Would be happy to learn more about it.
Hari Om!
