Hare Krishna. As some of you may be aware, Sri Devanathan was researching
in to Narasimha Tapani Upanishad. It is said that it has commentary
attributed to Sankara or Gaudapada. I would like to know what scholars on
this forum think. Also, can someone cite references to Gopala Tapani
Upanishad in Advaita tradition?
