SAdara praNAm Sriramji,
Won't it be better to
Consider Sanskrit as SAstra BhAsha
rather than Rastra BhAsha?

We should not forget Tamil
That is also rich with literature
of which some are not find in Sanskrit.
Shouldn't  we be more rational
when coming to a national
cause when our forefathers
says "Ano bhadrAh krithavo yantu Viswathah"?

By the By would yo Plse enlighten us
on Lalitha Hridaya Stotra?

Namaste.
