That said, as already pointed out, the extra a-kAra before sampatprada is a real problem of unintended changes in meaning due to typos!

There is a hard conjunct consonant "pr" in -prada, so naturally, a hard consonant ending in -t for the preceding word sampat- (instead of the soft consonant ending in -d) would be the natural way to recite it all together. In fact, I would venture to suggest that most people, even if they see the printed word as sampad-prada would pronounce it as sampat-prada when reciting, because that would be the natural tendency of the human voice.
