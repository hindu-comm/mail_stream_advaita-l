There are no opposite meanings possible here. The real problem is not about meaning, but about the quality of the sound.



The ta-kAra should be used (sampat-) because of the following term, -prada. It would have been sampad (da-kAra) if a different sound had followed, e.g. a vowel, as per rules of sandhi in saMskRta. 



Most of these rules of sandhi should really be quite intuitively obvious. There is a hard conjunct consonant "pr" in -prada, so naturally, a hard consonant ending in -t for the preceding word sampat- (instead of the soft consonant ending in -d) would be the natural way to recite it all together. In fact, I would venture to suggest that most people, even if they see the printed word as sampad-prada would pronounce it as sampat-prada when reciting, because that would be the natural tendency of the human voice.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
