In the introduction to the Aitareya Upanishad bhAShyam Shankara cites the
KaivalyopaniShad mantra 'na karamaNA na prajayA dhanEna tyAgEnaike
amRtatvam AnashuH' by mentioning 'iti cha kaivalya-shrutiH'.

Hare Krishna

na karmaNa maNtra is there in taitereeya mahAnArAyaNa up. also.  I read 
some where that the statement  'iti cha kaivalya shrutiH' could be the 
later addition to the original bhAshya since  normally we dont see shruti 
references by shankara when quoting shruti maNtra-s, he quotes directly 
shruti maNtra without any reference title like this. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
