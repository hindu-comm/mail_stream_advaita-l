In the same Aitareya introduction Shankara cites 'kurvanneveha karmANi ..'
of the 2nd mantra of the Ishavasyopanishad and says: 'iti cha vaajinAm'
[This is vAjasaneya - shukla yajurveda].  In fact the very previous
sentence of what I cited before is a reference to 'atyAshramibhyaH paramam
pavitram....' (shvetashvatara upanishat) and Shankara writes.. iti cha
shvetAshvatarE vijnAyatE.

There are many more like iti chandogAH, bahvRchAH, AtharvaNikAH, etc.  Even
while citing smRtis Shankara has sometimes specified vyAsasmRti, etc.
