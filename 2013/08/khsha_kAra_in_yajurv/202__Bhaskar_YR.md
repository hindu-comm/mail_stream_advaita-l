Hare Krishna

In the saMhita maNtra-s (taitereeya krishna yajurveda) we find words like 
dikhshu, khshetra, chakhshu etc. ( pls. note the mahAprANa 'kha' in these 
words, example: khshetrasya patina vayaguM hiteneva jayAmasi etc. ) but as 
we all know normally these words have only 'ka' (alpa prANa 'ka')..kindly 
let me know which is the way of correct pronunciation while chanting 
saMhita maNtra-s??   AFAIK, there is no word that has 'khsha' in Sanskrit 
normal usage, we have only words like kshetra, dikshu, chakshu etc. with 
alpaprANa 'ka' only.  Kindly give some more details on the usage of 
'khsha' (mahA prANa)  in veda maNtra-s. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

PS:  My special request to Sri Ramakrishna Balasubramanian prabhuji and 
Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji who have studied their respective veda shAkha 
saMhita bhAga.
