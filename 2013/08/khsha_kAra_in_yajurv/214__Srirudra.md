Dear
When there are different unique letters are available to pronounce the words why one should go for combination of two letters to create one letter even though phonetically they create the required effect of pronounciation is not understandable.Will any one write station as stashun?I think we should give respect to the tradition of a language and should not dabble with the words and their pronounciation.R.Krishnamoorthy.
