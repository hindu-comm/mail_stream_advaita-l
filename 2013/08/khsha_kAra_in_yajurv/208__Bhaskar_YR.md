praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Though I cannot read the Sanskrit in your mail (it is full of computer 
characters, as you can see yourself from the below mail of yours)  I 
understand the pATa bheda.  With this I understood that  khshetrasya, 
dikhshu, chakhshu (with mahAprANa 'kha') is the correct way of 
pronunciation according to dAkShiNAtya saMpradAya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

I have with me a 'कृष्णयजुर्वेदीय 
तैत्तिरीयसंहिता’ (युधिष्ठिरमीमांसकः,
बहाल्गढ, सोनेपत- हरयाणा). तत्र 
’प्रकाशकीयम्’ इत्यत्र इदं दृश्यते -

The editor has said that there are differences in rendering the veda by
people of Maharashtra (M) and the Southern (dAkShiNAtya) states (D ) and
gives a few examples from the taittiriya samhitA:

1.1.1 M.   ayakShmAH        D.  ayakhShmAH
1.2.2         RksAmayoH             RkhsAmayoH
6.6.11        yatShoDashI            yathShoDashI
5.5.7          samvatsareNa         samvathsareNa
1.1.9           virapshin                  viraphshin
3.4.7          apsarasaH                aphsarasaH

From the illustrations one can see that the D (southern recension) is what
is having the harsh sounds replaced for the soft ones of the Maharashtra
recension.

I am not providing the translation of the editor's note here.

तैत्तिरीयशाखाया महाराष्ट्रप्रदेशे 
दक्षिणापथे च यदध्ययनमध्यापनं प्रचरति,
तत्र केचन नियमिबद्धाः पाठभेदा 
उपलभ्यन्ते ।...अस्याः संहिताया एकं कञ्चन 
पाठं
प्राधान्येनोररीकृत्य अपरपाठे 
वर्तमानानां विशिष्टानां पाठानां 
टिप्पण्यां
...एकेन पुस्तकेन ....उभयविधपाठयोश्च 
तुलनात्मके समीक्षणे सौकर्यं भवति ।

He has also remarked that sha-Sha-sa vyanjanas also undergo some changes
which are authorized by taittiriya prAtishAkhya 14.11-13.  In the same 
vein
pANinIya system too through the 'chayo dvitiyAH shari pauShkarAsAdeH 
8.4.48
there is concurrence to the rule.

  *महाराष्ट्रियकदाक्षिणात्यपाठयोः 
पाठभेदानां निदर्शनम् *- (अत्र
किञ्चित्प्रदर्श्य) ’एवं 
क्वचिदनुदात्तस्वराङ्कने, अनुवाके
चावान्तरविभागस्यान्त्यवर्णस्योत्तरविभागादाद्यवर्णेन 
सह
सन्धिभावाभावयोर्वैशिष्ट्यमुपलभ्यते, 
तत्सर्वं यथासम्प्रदायमेव विज्ञातव्यम् 
।
इति ।
