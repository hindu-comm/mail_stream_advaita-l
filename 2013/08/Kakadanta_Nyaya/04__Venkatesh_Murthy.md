'Kakadanta-Nyaya
This is akin to Vandhya-putra-Nyaya, Gaganaaravinda-Nyaya,
Gandharvanagara-Nyaya or
Shashavishna-Nyaya. It is useless to search for the teeth of a crow, for it
has no teeth. Similar is the
case with the son of a barren woman, a lotus grown in the sky, a city in
the clouds, and the horns of a
hare. This is to show that it is meaningless to question about the
contradictions and mysteries of
existence like “Why did the Perfect God create an imperfect world?” etc.,
for there is no real change
and there is no creation at all in reality, and that these questions arise
so long as the Sun of Wisdom has not arisen.'
