Respected Scholars,

Namaste! I (BA Hons in Philosophy with Sanskrit and History, Calcutta 
University, 2001; M.A, department of Philosophy, University of Madras, 
2004; MPhil, department of Philosophy, University of Madras, 2005) have submitted my Ph.D. dissertation on a topic entitled 'Philosophy of Advaita Vedanta according to Madhusudana Sarasvati's Gudharthadipika' to SOAS (University of London) last month and await the examiners' report shortly. 

May I request you kindly let me know and guide me if you hear of any prospect of further study/research/post-doc/teaching position either in India or elsewhere. 


With best rgs and looking forward to hearing from you,
Niranjan Saha,
Kolkata, India
