Mother Sharada Devi in the standing position, as established by Adi Shankaracharya

//

In Vidyasankara Temple of Sringeri, just at the right hand side, you would find an idol 
of Mother Sharada made of sandalwood. One of the hands got broken. 

This was the original sharada murti worshipped by shankara bhagavatpada. 

Mother Sharada isdakSiNAmurti swarUpiNi. The aksha mAlika, amrita kalasa, chinmudraand pushtaka ---these are similar both to shArada and dakshinamurti. 
And dakshinamurti is adored as adi-guru in advaita acharya parampara. 

Acharya Sankara visualized the entire bhArata bhUmi as yajna vEdi.In yajna vedika,
there should be representatives of 4 vedas and hence 4 mutts were established to represent chatur-dwArAs of the yajna bhUmi. 

There are only 4 vedas; only 4 mahAvAkyAs;only 4 adhyAyAs of brahmasUtra; 4 avasthAs (jAgrat,swapna, sushupti & turiya); 4 aspects in praNava;only 4 ashramAs;
only 4 purushArthAs .....

This was the vision of shankara.
