"If Shiva is angry with you, your Guru will protect you" - Guru Gita.


I've received a few queries on the new "Chaturamnaya" mailing list, hope this posting clarifies anydoubts.


About a couple of weeks ago, Iasked Vidya if there could be a mailing list for the Sankara Maths, and got the nod of approval. I then exchanged emails with Jaldhar (discussing reasons already mentioned in the "FAQ" of the list, such as the Sankara Maths being the oldest in the tradition, their adherence toDharma, etc.) and he createdthe list giving it the name "Chaturamnaya". The FAQ and Rules were drafted by me later.


Personally,I haven't visited any of the Sankara Maths except Sringeri - and that was over two decades ago. But I maintaina high regard for the Jagadguru Peetham in the Sankara tradition. An ounce of instruction from the Guru is weightierthan a ton of arguments on a subject.


The new list is for any discussions concerning Vedic Dharma, but within the framework of the teachings of the Sankara Maths. At this time, the list is NOT moderated.
