One of the difficulties of conveying the Advaita positions on sat, asat, (an)Rta 
and (an)upalabdhi is the medium of translation. For example,

Here, what is called unreal in the English language is actually described not as
asat/asatya in the saMskRta original, but as anRta (अनृत). Personally, I would
like to search for a different English word than unreal to translate this, especially
as later in the same upanishat, there is a sentence that says satya itself became
satya and anRta. The upanishat text and the bhAshya very masterfully play with
the words sat, asat and anRta, to direct our attention to that which is beyond
words.

Again, here, to get the full force of nirAtmakatva in translation, I would choose,
"they would not have been perceived, since they would have been insubstantial."
The point is that if name and form had originated from the unreal (asatash cet),
then they would have been nirAtmaka and therefore they would not have been
perceived at all (na upalabhyeta). That they are indeed perceptible (upalabhyate
tu) means that their source has to be sad-vastu.

This may seem like a minor point, but I bring it up, because one of the major
misunderstandings of advaita, both by followers of other vedAnta streams and
by people who were originally alien to any vedAnta tradition is this. They take 
advaita as saying that nAma and rUpa are anyway unreal, so they mistakenly
ask, why should one argue for a real source of an unreal world?
