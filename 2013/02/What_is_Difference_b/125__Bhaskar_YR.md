But Brahma is not like that. Even if you taste it continously for long
time you will not feel sad.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Yes, vishayAnanda is also (metaphorically)  part of that infinite 
brahmAnanda (see taitereeya about mAnushAnanda), it is just like, a dog 
licking the dry bone and enjoying its own blood :-)) sushupti Anada comes 
close to this ever lasting brahmAnanda, hence every night  everyone eager 
to go to bed to have a sound sleep :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
