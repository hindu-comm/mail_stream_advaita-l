Namaste

But if Vishaya Sukha is just like Brahmananda but it is limited only.
There is a problem. To get Brahmananda I will have to learn Vedanta
and struggle for many many years. Then also there is no guarantee I
will get Brahmananda. Why should I do that? I can be satisfied with
Vishaya Ananda and enjoy little things every day in my life. It is
much easier compared to struggling for Brahmananda.

What is the true difference between Brahmananda and Vishayananda?
