Namaste

I find one difference. If you like to eat sweet Pongal  you will enjoy
1st plate. If you are hungry the 2nd plate will give joy also. But if
you try to eat 50 plates you can see after some time you will not like
it. Joy becomes converted to unhappiness and pain.

But Brahma is not like that. Even if you taste it continously for long
time you will not feel sad.
