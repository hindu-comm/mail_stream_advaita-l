In the preamble to the BrahmasutrabhAShyam Shankaracharya raises a question:

सर्वो हि पुरोऽवस्थिते विषये विषयान्तरमध्यस्यति, युष्मत्प्रत्ययापेतस्य च
प्रत्यगात्मनोऽविषयत्वं ब्रवीषि ।

Everyone superimposes something on something that exists as an external
object.  But you, the Advaitin, hold that the innermost Self which is
devoid of the 'you' thought, is never an (external) object

उच्यते - न तावदयमेकान्तेनाविषयः, अस्मत्प्रत्ययविषयत्वात्, अपरोक्षत्वाच्च
प्रत्यगात्मप्रसिद्धेः ।* न चायमस्ति नियमः
पुरोऽवस्थित एव विषये विषयान्तरमध्यसितव्यमिति ।* अप्रत्यक्षेऽपि ह्याकाशे
बालाः तलमलिनताद्यध्यस्यन्ति । एवमविरुद्धः प्रत्यगात्मन्यप्यनात्मध्यासः ।

Reply: The Self is not totally unobjectifiable.  It is indeed the object of
the 'I' thought.  Also it, the Self, is most intimate and is in everyone's
experience as the innermost.  Further, there is no rule that an adhyAsa has
to take place in an object that is available externally, perceptibly.  Even
in the external space that is not an object of perception ignorant ones
superimpose base, dirt, etc.  Thus the superimposition of the not-self in
the innermost self is not contradictory to reason and experience.

Further down in the same document Shankara says: *अध्यासो नाम
अतस्मिंस्तद्बुद्धिरित्यवोचाम *।
[We have said before that adhyAsa is the perceiving of one thing in a locus
that is not that thing.]

From this  we can say that the adhyAsa of the 'bAlayakSha' is a case of
अविद्यमाने वस्तुनि विद्यमानत्वरूपाध्यासः ।  An external object like rope
need not be necessarily present in one's perceptive range in order to lend
the possibility of an adhyAsa of a snake to take place.  The very
deeming/thinking that an object exists while there is not even the
possibility of that object existing is undoubtedly adhyAsa:
अविद्यमानवस्तुनि विद्यमानत्वरूपाध्यासः । एवं परमार्थतोऽविद्यमाने वालयक्षे
तद्विद्यमानत्वरूपाध्यास  एवात्र प्रकृताध्यासः. The case of bAlayakSha is
exactly this.  The mother's words only act as a trigger and the child's
imagination takes over to complete the adhyAsa process. This is what is
demonstrated in the twin-song of Sri Purandaradasa ('gummana kareyadire'
and 'gummanelliha toramma').
