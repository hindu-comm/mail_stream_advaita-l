May be the recitation of the Bhagavad Gita could still be a valid way to help as it may refresh the Vedantic knowledge in him, who just left his physical body and is very much living in the house awaiting his new body being formed. That is particularly applicable for a person who has read the Bhagavad Gita, while living, and who has developed the love for the Lord, one's higher Self. 

Regards,
Sunil KB

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] I have a question on reading of Garuda Purana at home after the death of a relative *\(Father in my case)

Dear Ramesh,

It is indeed touching to read your report of your father's demise. The
tradition of reading the Garuda purANam is as per Sri Anand Hudli's
response: it is done before the completion of the Ashaucham period, or the
period of 'impurity.'. Your vAdhyar will be the best person to schedule
this for you.

Regarding your wish to secure for your departed father the state of mokSha,
pl. note that in Vedanta it is only through self-knowledge that moksha can
be accomplished. And none else other than that individual can do this.
See this teaching of the Vivekachudamani:

ऋणमोचनकर्तारः पितुः सन्ति सुतादयः
बन्धमोचनकर्ता तु स्वस्माद् अन्यो न कश्चन. ५१

Sons and suchlike are able free their father from debts, but none
can free someone else from bondage. 51

मस्तकन्यस्तभारादेर्दुःखम् अन्यैर्निवार्यते
क्षुधादिकृतदुःखं तु विना स्वेन न केनचित्. ५२

The pain of something like a weight on the head can be removed by
others, but the pain of things like hunger can be put an end to by
none but oneself. 52

पथ्यमौषधसेवा च क्रियते येन रोगिणा
आरोग्यसिद्धिर्दृष्टास्य नान्यानुष्ठितकर्मणा. ५३

A sick man is seen to get better by taking the appropriate medicine
not through treatment undertaken by others. 53

वस्तुस्वरूपं स्फुटबोधचक्षुषा
स्वेनैव वेद्यं न तु पण्डितेन
चन्द्रस्वरूपं निजचक्षुषैव
ज्ञातव्यमान्यैरवगम्यते किम्. ५४

Reality can be experienced only with the eye of understanding, not
just by a scholar. What the moon is like must be seen with one’s own
eyes. How can others do it for you? 54

अविद्याकामकर्मादिपाशबन्धं विमोचितुम्
कः शक्नुयाद् विनात्मानं कल्पकोटिशतैरपि. ५५

Who but yourself can free you from the bonds of the fetters of
things like ignorance, desire and the consequences of your actions
even in hundreds of thousands of years? 55

न योगेन न सांख्येन कर्मणा नो न विद्यया
ब्रह्मात्मैकत्वबोधेन मोक्षः सिध्यति नान्यथा. ५६

Liberation is achieved not by observances or by analysis, nor by
deeds or learning, but only by the realization of one's oneness with
God, and by no other means. 56

You might wish him the best. It might help him getting
the favorable birth that is conducive to AtmasAdhana.
