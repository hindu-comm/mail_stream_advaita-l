Dear Sri Ramesh Ramanan
Very sorry to hear the sad news.When I lost my father 23years ago -he was 78 
then-I had the same feeling that I should have taken more care of him than 
what I could do.May be every son/daughter who love their parents will have 
the same feeling.About Garuda puranam it can be read during the 12days upto 
Grekkiam.This is as per my purohit`s advice.Afterwards they say it should 
not be read.All the near and dearones can read/hear it during the period of 
mourning.But opinions differ.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Subject: [Advaita-l] I have a question on reading of Garuda Purana at 
homeafter the death of a relative *\(Father in my case)


Dear members,

Pranams and Sashtanga Namaskarams.

I am extremely sad to inform you that my respectable father, aged 79, passed 
away on 30th January at 2.05 pm, after undergoing a lot of hardships in an 
hospital in Chennai. He had a paralytic stroke,burst heart-vessel (he had a 
by-pass surgery in 2009) and severe brain hemorrage. on Monday28th January.

Now, I would like to know from all of you, honestly, whether a good reading 
of the Garuda Purana will give peace to my father's spirit and if yes, when 
should the reading be done by the Sasthrigal (is it before or after the 13th 
day karmas?) And for how many days should the reading be performed, minimum 
and maximum number of days and do all the children and wife of the departed 
soul have to be present at the reading?

My father was a very quiet, nice person, who never wished ill for anyone. He 
sacrificed all his life taking care of us and though I took care of him for 
the past three years like my own baby,, I am ashamed and sad to say that I 
did not take sufficient care of him. I want Janma-raahitya Moksha (birthless 
salvation for him), as I definitely do not want him to take another birth in 
any form and suffer

So I would definitely appreciate a good, well-thought-out answer to the 
above questions.
I am extremely sorry to take your time and trouble you with my questions, 
but my heart aches and cries out for the peace of my father. Ramesh Ramanan.
