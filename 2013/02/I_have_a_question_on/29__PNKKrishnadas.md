May be the recitation of the Bhagavad Gita could still be a valid way to help as it may refresh the Vedantic knowledge in him, who just left his physical body and is very much living  in the house  awaiting  his new body being formed. That is particularly applicable for a person who has read the Bhagavad Gita, while living, and who has developed the love for the Lord, one's higher Self.
