If you read Gajendra Moksham from Bhagavatham within ten days, he will attain vaikuntha. If you chant hari nam and read the story of ajamila within ten days, his sukshma sarira will hear it and chant mentally. This will attract vishnu dhutas to come and take him to vaikuntha. 

The text is available online and you can read them yourself. If you know devotees of hari or good vaidhika brahmanas trained in bhagavatha saptaham in your city, then you can request them to read. 

For your own  citta suddhi and out of respect for vaidhika dharma,  you still have to meticulously perform karma to your capacity.

Subject: [Advaita-l] I have a question on reading of Garuda Purana at home
	after the death of a relative *\(Father in my case)

Dear members,

Pranams and Sashtanga Namaskarams. 

I am extremely sad to inform you that my respectable father, aged 79, passed away on 30th January at 2.05 pm, after undergoing a lot of hardships in an hospital in Chennai. He had a paralytic stroke,burst heart-vessel (he had a by-pass surgery in 2009) and severe brain hemorrage. on Monday28th January. 

Now, I would like to know from all of you, honestly, whether a good reading of the Garuda Purana will give peace to my father's spirit and if yes, when should the reading be done by the Sasthrigal (is it before or after the 13th day karmas?) And for how many days should the reading be performed, minimum and maximum number of days and do all the children and wife of the departed soul have to be present at the reading? 

My father was a very quiet, nice person, who never wished ill for anyone. He sacrificed all his life taking care of us and though I took care of him for the past three years like my own baby,, I am ashamed and sad to say that I did not take sufficient care of him. I want Janma-raahitya Moksha (birthless salvation for him), as I definitely do not want him to take another birth in any form and suffer 

So I would definitely appreciate a good, well-thought-out answer to the above questions.
I am extremely sorry to take your time and trouble you with my questions, but my heart aches and cries out for the peace of my father. Ramesh Ramanan.
