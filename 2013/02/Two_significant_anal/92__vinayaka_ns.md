Namaste,

Well written; it may be said that there are two types of aspirants
with temperamental differences (cf. dhyAnEnAtmani pashyanti... (gita)). One
is vichArapara and another is dhyAnapara. DhyAna becomes anga for
vichArapara class and vichAra is the anga for the sAdhakas who are devoted
to meditation. Thus samkhya and dhyana are interconnected. Intuition of the
Self takes place in the dhyAna samskrta antaHkarana.

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
