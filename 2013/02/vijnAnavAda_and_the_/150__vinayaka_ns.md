Namaste,

There is a concept of Alaya vijnAna in the yOgAchAra school of buddhism. My
question is, is this a standard concept of this school which is accepted by
all? Is there any reference/refutation of this concept in the
shAnkarabhAshya and the sub-commentators of the advaita tradtion?

I also would like to know how it is different from the concept of
mAyA/cosmic-mind of advaita?

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
