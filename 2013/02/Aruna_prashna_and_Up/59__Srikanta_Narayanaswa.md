I had recently been to Puri where the Goverdhan peetha is said to be installed by Adi Shankaracharya.I saw the board which details the Amnaya mutts established by Sri.Shankara.The board also gives the details of who the first Acharya of the mutt.It was Padmapadacharya and the veda of the Amnaya was Samaveda and the Mahavakya of the Amnaya.is "Tatvamasi"A pamplet detailing these details also I received from the office.But,I found to my surprise that these details are different in the board and the pamplet.Also,there is a bed where Sri.Shankara is said to have rested.But,this room is closed to the public and opened in the evening.With no malice,I would like to say that this mutt is no where near Sringeri mutt,which is located amidst serene surroundings with constant Vedic chanting.The Puri mutt is located near the sea,but I could not find any Vedic vidwans chanting the Vedas.
N.Srikanta.
