Here is a collection of two talks delivered in Kannada by a very senior
VyakaraNa scholar, Vidwan S.T.Nagaraj on the 'KumArasambhavam' and the
'Raghuvamsha'.  Even though it is in Kannada, anyone who can appreciate a
little bit of Sanskrit can also enjoy the talks and greatly benefit from
them.  Importantly, the talks have much  relevance to Advaita.
