second publication titled Ashreya Subrahmanya Sthothram  - Sri Subrahmanya
Siddha Ashtottara Shatanamavali,  a Srividya approach to Parabrahman in the
form of Subrahmanya.This ashtottara puja is done as a last puja before
deeparadhana, neivedhya etc. in Srividyopasana. This namavali has been
composed by
Sri Atmanandanatha,the paramaguru of Sri Chidanandanatha.The 375 page book

Sakthimaya (the residence of Mrs Rajam Sury) by Sri Goda Venkateswara
