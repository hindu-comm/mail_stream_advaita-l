RV: In gaudiya vaishnavam, it is not mandatory for a jiva to go to some
other loka to attain liberation. Bhagavad jnana produces atma jnana
instantaneously just as opening the window of a dark room reveals not only
the sun but also oneself. One may still go to a world to relish a
particular type of relationship.  A chair is different from the table but a
leg of a chair is different from the chair but at the same time the chair.
In the same way, jiva is considered one with ishwara while being different.
There is no delimitation just as shakti does not limit a shaktiman. I would
be curious to know if bhedAbheda has been dealt with by Adi Sankara or
other Sankaracharyas.
