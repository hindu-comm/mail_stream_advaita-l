The seventh mantra of the mAnDUkya upanishad 'nAntaH
prajnam......prapanchopashamam shAntam shivam advaitam ....sa AtmA sa
vijneyaH' can be taken as a comprehensive definition of the Absolute,
called turIya.

As both the Veda/shAstra and Ishwara are anAdi there is no problem if the
shAstra defines Ishwara, for instance in the sixth mantra of the above
upanishad.
