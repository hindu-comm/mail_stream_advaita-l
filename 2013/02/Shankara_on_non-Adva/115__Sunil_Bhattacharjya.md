Namaste,

In science we have the Wave - Particle duality. It is not absolute existence in the Particle-state nor absolute existence in the Wave-state, but together it is an absolute existence in the dual-state. It cannot be separated and nor can it be described as absolutely separate nor as absolutely one. Such is the anirvachaniya state that is. Similar is the Para-Brhaman and Apara-Brahman duality. I am afraid that digging much into it may result in some dire consequences. Did not Yajnavalkya warn Gargi that there is always a limit to which the argumentation can proceed ?

Regards,
Sunil KB

The seventh mantra of the mAnDUkya upanishad 'nAntaH
prajnam......prapanchopashamam shAntam shivam advaitam ....sa AtmA sa
vijneyaH' can be taken as a comprehensive definition of the Absolute,
called turIya.

As both the Veda/shAstra and Ishwara are anAdi there is no problem if the
shAstra defines Ishwara, for instance in the sixth mantra of the above
upanishad.
