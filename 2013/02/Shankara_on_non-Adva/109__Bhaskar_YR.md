In advaita, are time and space accepted as created entities? If yes, then 
we must have an Ishwara transcendental to time and space who has the power 
of  time and space. This power or quality can have neither beginning nor 
end. So you to accept at least one quality of Ishwara as beyond 
spacio-temporal limitations (or absolute).

If spacio-temporal limitation is the criteria to decide the transcendental 
nature of Ishwara then we have to call  'avidyA' too as transcendental 
because it has been addressed as 'anAdi & ananta' :-)) And jeeva also for 
that matter, shataM sahasramayuntaMnyarbudamasaNkhyeyaM svamasmin 
nivishtaM says saMhita, so we have to conclude that the concept of jeeva 
too transcendental coz. it is anAdyananta.  But as you know, that is not 
the case in advaita.  IMO, we have to understand these anAdi & anantatva 
of jeeva, avidyA etc. contextually without doing any siddhAnta hAni. So is 
the approach when it comes to Ishwara also.  Because shankara himself says 
Ishwara is kevala vyAvahArika satya which is avidyAkruta.
