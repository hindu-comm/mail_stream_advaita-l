In Advaita individuality cannot exist as all visheshas are avidyAkalpita
and one individual can be different from another only thru vishesha, a
position that the Madhwa school fundamentally depends upon.  It is the
nirvishesha Brahman that is the sole reality according to Advaita.  In any
case this is not an Advaita and GV or any other school debate.

All rUpa, including that Bhagavan takes, is time-bound; it has a beginning
and an end. And they are either avidyA or mAyA kalpita and therefore do not
stand the test of absolutism.

In fact this purely Advaitic position that only signifies anirvachanIyatva
of the creation is already summarised in this article:

But that shakti is there in Him only because of the world and the jiva-s.
Since Bhagavan or Brahman is nitya tripta, It has nothing to gain from
creation.  And the shakti is inferred in It only from seeing the creation.
So a shakti that is dependent on / for the sake of creation cannot be the
svarUpa lakShaNa of Brahman; it can be only a taTastha lakShana.  Then, it
boils down to adhyasta in brahman, that can be easily negated for the
purpose of realizing Its true nature.

Also, if jIva and jagat are inseparable from Brahman, it becomes necessary
to state in clear terms on what kind of relationship do they exist in
Brahman.  If it is samyoga sambandha, it will render Brahman finite, with
parts, and therefore perishable for only such objects can conjoin with each
other.  If they are inseparably there in Brahman, then their doshas are
unavoidable in / inseparable from Brahman.  Thus the only way they can
exist in Brahman is through adhyAsa which alone can make Brahman absolutely
free of their contact and the defects such a contact can bring.  That is
the Advaitic way.
