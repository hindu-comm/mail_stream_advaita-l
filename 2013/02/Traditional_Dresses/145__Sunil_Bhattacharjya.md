Namaste,

My wife belonged to the Chitrapur Saraswat community and though her parents lived in Mumbai, she spent her childhood days with her grandparents in Dharwad. Her grandmother used to wear 9 yards saree. During our marriage my wife wore 9 yards saree only during the performance of the Vedic ritual for the marriage. However that was the only time she wore the 9 yards saree and never before or after that. 

Regards,
Sunil KB

The Kannada smartha people too have this eight or nine yards saree. It is
either mElu kacche like the Madhwas (actually the Madhwas have followed it
from the Maharashtra women, where one can see even today, even non-brahmin
orthodox women wear it that way, and even coolie women wear it that way, as
I have myself seen in Mumbai and when non-brahmin Maharashtrians come to
Sringeri) or 'oLa kacche' where the kacche is invisible, having been
covered up by outer layers of the sari which is worn just like the six
yards type. And there are ways of making a kacche type draping over the
front too by orthodox women of smartha groups where of course the kacche is
inside too.

In Dharwad regions smartha women too wear the sari like Madhwas.

Also, even the six yards sari can be worn as madisar by Iyengar people and
as kacche by Madhwa women.

Even today smartha orthodox women regurlarly wear the kacche either outside
or inside types. And many do it on special occasions like shraaddha or
where maDi cooking etc. is required.

Chitpavan smarthas wear like Madhwas, as they too originated from
maharashtra.

This is based on my observation being in Bangalore.
