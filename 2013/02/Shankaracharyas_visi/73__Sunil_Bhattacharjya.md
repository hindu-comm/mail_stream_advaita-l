Dear firends,
Recently I read that in the book Encyclopedia of Shaivism (page 210) by Swami Parameshwaranand, there is mention that the Sankaracharya of Amardak Agni Math visited Nepal in 1199 CE and that he mainatained (or introduced?) the tradition of worship of Pashupatinatha by brahmins of Tailangana. If that is so, (i) does this conflict with Adi Sankarachary's visit to Nepal and secondly (ii) where is this Agni Math of Amardak and was it established by Adi Sankaracharya?

Regards,
Sunil KB
