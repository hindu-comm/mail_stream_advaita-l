In the Wikipedia article five different Navaratris are given.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navratri

5. Magha Navaratri: Magha Navaratri, also referred as Gupta Navaratri,
is nine days dedicated to the nine forms of Shakti (Mother Goddess) in
the month of Magha (Januaryâ€“February). Magha Navaratri is observed
during the Magha Shukla Paksha (waxing phase of moon).

What is the Magha Navaratri? How it is celebrated and do we have to
follow same procedures of Pooja, Chandi Patha, like in Sharan
Navaratri? Kindly reply.
