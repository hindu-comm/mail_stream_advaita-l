and the spitting of the red juice on someone

It was none other than syama sastri's own guru Sri Sangeeta Swami, who was a yati.

Sri Syama Sastri had this habit of chewing paan and tantra shAstra prescribes this 
method for getting the grace of syAmala dEvi in order to excel in sangita shAstra. 
The rAja syAmala mantra anuSTAna prescribes the mantra anuSTAna with paan in
the mouth for quick siddhi in sangeeta shAstra. There is a prakriya of propitiating
"ucchiSTa mAtangi" this way. 

The rules for syAmala mantra japa include respecting the ladies of lower varNa especially belonging tofishing community; respecting the vaiNikAs, playing of veeNa and worshipping it. 

A sign of mantra siddhi is the as soon as the japa purashcharana is performed, a parrot comes to accept the naivEdya which is offered to syAmala. 

There is another incident related to "tAmbUla charvaNa" in Kanchipuram. 

There was a dumb boy who used to sit in the premises of gAyatri mantapam of Kamakshi Temple. One day, it so happened that Kamakshi appeared before a certain upAsaka who was doing srividya anuSTAna in the temple. Mother Kamakshi was chewing betel nut and wanted to put that same ucchiSTa betel nut into the mouth of that upAsaka. He refused the offer being ucchiSTa. Immediately, She grace that dumb boy who was sitting under a pillar and thrust forth Her ucchiSTa paan into the mouth of that dumb boy. 

And lo ! melodious poetry in the form of 500 slokas gushed forth from his mouth which is known as "Muka Panchashati" and that lad is none other than Muka Sankara. 

This is the power of the ucchiSTa tAmbula of Mother Kamakshi !!!!
