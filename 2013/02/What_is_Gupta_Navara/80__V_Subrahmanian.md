Thanks.  Here is that episode that I had heard long ago:

https://sites.google.com/site/chitrakoota/Home/carnatic-music

// *Sangita* *Swami* instructed him to make the acquaintance of *
Pachimariyam* *Adiyappan* to listen to his scholarly music. *Shyama* *
Shastri* did so, and almost immediately became *Adiyappayya’s* favorite. He
was quite enthralled by the young *Shyama’s* music and even, it is said,
refused to wipe a stain *Shyama* had accidentally caused while chewing
betel leaves from his clothes, saying that it, too, had in it the mysteries
of *Shyama’s* true music (*nija* *sangita*).//

Thanks to Shri D.V.N.Sharma for the other reference.
