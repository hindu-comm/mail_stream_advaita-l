Namaste Sriram,

How it is possible to do Mantra Japa when chewing Tambula? I cannot
say Mantra properly.

I heard some ladies with babies have habit of chewing Tambula and
spitting the juice into babies mouth. The babies will have good
health. This was practice in my grandmother's time. Now I have not
seen modern mothers do it. The mothers in villages may do it.

In Mahabharata there is one story I cannot remember fully. One Rishi
was praying to Indra. Indra appeared and Rishi asked for boon. He said
he has to get water when he feels thirsty. One day the Rishi was going
in a forest and he was very thirsty. When he remembered the boon one
hunter appeared with a dirty bag tied near his private parts. It was
tied like if he passed urine it could fall in the bag.The hunter
offered him water from the bag. But Rishi thought the water was bad
and did not accept it. Later Indra came and scolded him. That hunter
was Indra in diguise and the water was Amruta. But Rishi refused it.

One day, it so happened that Kamakshi appeared before a certain upAsaka who was doing srividya anuSTAna in the temple.  Mother Kamakshi was chewing betel nut and wanted to put that same ucchiSTa betel nut into the mouth of that upAsaka.  He refused the offer being ucchiSTa.  Immediately, She grace that dumb boy who was sitting under a pillar and thrust forth Her ucchiSTa paan into the mouth of that dumb boy.
