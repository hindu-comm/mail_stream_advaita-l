tripurArNavatantram is available from sampUrNAnanda saMskR^ita University.
If you write to chaukhamba, then may confirm it's availability.

I've no idea about khadyota.

In addition to it,
I heard that tR^ich-bhAskara of bhAskararAya makhin was printed by Ananda
Ashrama saMsthA of puNe. Is it possible to get any photocopy of scan of
this book.
