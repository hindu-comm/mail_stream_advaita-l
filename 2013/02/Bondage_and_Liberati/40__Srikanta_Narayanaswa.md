OM
The entire exercise of the pursuit of ATMA JNANAM revolves around the
interpretation of shAstrA and the individual!
shraddA-GURU-tradition- mananam-getting the doubts clarified- and staying
on to the knowledge is the intelligent way of pursuing ADVAITA.

In Adwaita vedanta,it is not interpretation on which it is based,but the right understanding.Even a comma or a fullstop at the wrong place can misinterpret the sentence.In the example above,what is referred is the Maya of the jiva-who is asleep due to Anadi maya.This maya belongs to the jiva.Though "shradda,Guru Tradition"are in their places,it is ultimately the understanding of the individual which can bring knowledge.
