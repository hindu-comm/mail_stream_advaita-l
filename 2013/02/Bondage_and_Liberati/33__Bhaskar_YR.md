I do not think it is wrong to call this samsAra-sleep-causing power as
'viShNu mayA/icchA'.  In the Bh.gita 7.14 we have 'mama mAyA duratyayA' as
said by the Lord Himself.  Shankara comments: mama Ishvarasya svabhUtA 
..'.
We can see Shankara commenting in the Kathopanishat as 'anAdi avidyayA
suptAH' for the mantra 'utthiShThata jAgrata...'.  So, in Vedanta there is
no difference between avidyA and mAyA.  It is One shakti.

avidyA is not Ishwara shakti, but mAya is, that is why sometimes we say 
there is no difference between shankti and shakta.  If this shakti is 
avidya then we have to say avidyA as the shakti can never be separated 
from brahma.  One should not read much in shankara's words 'avidyAtmikA hi 
beeja shaktiH' here  to treat avidyA is some type of shakti. 

Anyway, we have discussed this topic somany times earlier in both the 
lists, just my jihvA chApalya prompted me to write something again  :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
