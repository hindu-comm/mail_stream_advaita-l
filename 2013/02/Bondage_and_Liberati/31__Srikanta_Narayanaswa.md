There had been comparison between Adwaita and Dwaita schools on the Mandukyopanishath Karika,
"Anadi Mayaya suptah yada jivah prabhudhyate!
Ajam anidram asvapanm adwaitam budhyate tada!!

Madhwacharya says here,Maya is "Vishnu Maya".But,here, what is written here is "Maya"which is Maya of the Jiva.If it is 'Vishnu Maya" the Karika would have mentioned "Vishnu Maya".But,it states,Anadi Mayaya suptah yada Jivah prabhudhyate.
N.Srikanta.
