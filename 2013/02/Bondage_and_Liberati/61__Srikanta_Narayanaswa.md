In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad I.4.10,Sri Shankara devotes exhaustively to prove that the Samsari Jiva is not different from the "Brahman".He takes into examination different "Purvapaksha"and answers them very exhaustively.Infact,it is this section which occupies more pages than other sections.He clearly distinguishes,"Vidya"and "Avidya"and says that it is the same Brahman when in vidya is a non-samsari and when in Avidya is a samsari.
N.Srikanta.
