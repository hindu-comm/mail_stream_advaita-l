>From your post I understand that Advaita school views Maya as an external one which subjects the jiva into samsara and Dwaita school views Maya as an one which inheres in the jiva and is called Vishnu Maya.Whether my understanding is correct?R.Krishnamoorthy.

In continuation of my reply on 9th Feb.to Sri.Subramaniam's response to my posting on 4th Feb.on the above topic,I hereby summarise my reply:
In his commentary on the Karika,"Anadimayaya suptah yada jivah prabhudhyate"Madhwacharya"means Maya as "Vishnu Maya".Sri.Subramaniam quotes Bhagawad Gita,Kathopanishat to explain that Maya/Iccha,and there is nothing wrong to call "Maya'as such.But,in the karika of Sri.Gaudapada,it is mentioned only."Anadi maya".Sri.Shankara explains what is this 'Anadi Maya"?This "AnadimYa'belongs to the "Jiva".This "Maya'has two fold "Lakshana".One is 'Tatvaapratibodha rupena"bijatmana,anyathagrahanalakshanena ca anadikalapravrttena Mayalakshanena svapena "Mama ayam pita,putroyam ,napta,ksetram ,grham,pashavah,aham esham svami,sukhi,duhki,kshayitoham anena,vardhitasca,anena iti evam prakaran svapnan sthanadvayepi pashyan suptah,yada Vedntarthatatvaabhijnena parama karunikena Guruna "nasi evam tvam hetuphalatmakah kimtu "Tatvamasi"iti pratibhodhyamanah ,tada evam pratibhudhyate!

We see from the commentary of Sri.Shankara,the Mya which is beginningless cases the 'Jiva"to cause the non-apprehension(Tatvaapratibodharupa)which is in seedform(Bijatmana)and "Anyathagrahana lakshana"which is "anadikala pravrttena Mayalakshanena"as "Mama ayam pita,putroyam etc.
There is need to read "Vishnu Maya"as belonging to "Vishnu".This is in "Jiva"himself in "Atman".This is the important difference between Sri.Shankara's and Madhwacharya's explanation.It is also the essential and prominent difference between the 'Adwaita"and "Dwaita" schools.

Dear Sri.R.Krishnamurthy
In your posting you have asked the Adwaita school views "Maya"as an external one which subjects the "Jiva'into "Samsara"and "Dwaita"school views 'Maya"as one which inheres in the jiva and is called "Vishnu Maya".You have asked whether my understanding is correct?

The "Adwaita"school views "Maya"as internal,not external.Actually Sri.Shankara calls this "Avidya".It is this avidya which subjects the Jiva into Samsara.It is the "Dwaita"school which views "Maya"as external and calls it "Vishnu Maya"
Regards,
N.Srikanta..
