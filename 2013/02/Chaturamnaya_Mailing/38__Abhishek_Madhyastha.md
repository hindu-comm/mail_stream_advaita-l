If you take media, especially INDIAN media for an authoritative
source, it would be an extremely dumb decision. Maybe you don't know
this, but the Shankaracharya of Dwarka & Jyotir peetham, Sri
Swaroopananda Saraswati & his disciple Swami Avimukteshwaranand
Saraswati are part of "Ganga Seva Abhiyaan" which is one of the prime
organizations working to clean up river Ganga. Some of its objectives
include the shutting down of illegal factories discharging effluents
into the Ganges. As such, the support of Swaroopanand Saraswati has
become more like an iconic force along with the leadership of
Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati. To counter them, the great Congress govt
is always waiting to "CREATE" one or the other controversy to malign
the reputation of the acharya. There have been several attempts to
malign the reputation of Puri Shankaracharya as well. I've even read
that a sanyasi named Adhokshajanand Tirth who is supposed to be a
congress promoted fraudster keeps causing problems claiming that he is
the legal Shankaracharya. The local courts had even barred him from
entry to or anywhere near Puri Peetham in order to avoid his nuisance.
Such things are quite common in N.India. Anything Hindu is branded as
anti-secular & tagged as "Hindu terror" there. However, in S.India,
due to the presence of vast number of mutts representing different
communities & their force, govts fear an outrage if they hurt people's
sentiments by abusing mutts. The Sringeri acharya as such has a huge
number of followers which even includes the pontiffs of these various
mutts which regard the acharya as a supreme sanyasi. Even
organizations like Ramakrishna mutt claim that the Sringeri acharya
alone is indirectly their moola guru. So, most politicians don't even
dare to speak about the acharya of Sringeri.
When govts themselves are making all sorts of efforts to destroy the
reputation of sanyasins, especially in N.India, I think its our
responsibility to actually stand by the side of the acharyas of the
chaturamnaya peethams, i.e our acharyas, insteads of believing idiotic
media speculations!
