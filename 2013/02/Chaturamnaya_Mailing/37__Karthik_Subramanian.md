Amongst the chaturamnaya peetams, only the Sringeri Math is said to be free of moral controversies. The other 3 have had their shares of checkered pasts and most definitely the Jyothir and Dwaraka Peetams with the incumbent pontiff well known to have 'handy' affiliations with a particular political party.

(The FAQ and Rules will be updated every now and then, hence please consult the latest version available in the list archives).

Chaturamnaya Mailing List FAQ
-----------------------------

Q: What are the Chaturamnaya Maths?
A: The Chaturamnaya Maths are the Four Maths in the tradition of Adi Sankara located in India at Sringeri (South), Dwaraka (West), Jyotirmath/Badrinath (North) and Puri (East).

Q: Why is there a need for a mailing list dedicated to the Chaturamnaya Maths?
A: The Chaturamnaya Maths stand out in distinction from the other Advaita institutions in the following ways:
1. The Four Maths are historically the oldest surviving institutions of Advaita teaching in the world.
-According to the extant biographies of Adi Sankara such as the Madhaviya Sankara Digvijayam, He is said to have established Maths in "Sringeri and other places".
2. The Four Maths trace their lineage of Gurus directly to Adi Sankara.
-The Guru-Shishya Parampara is central to the teaching of Advaita Vedanta.
3. The Four Maths lead people to follow the path of Dharma.
-These Maths have remained free of Ethical or Moral controversies during their entire history.
Last but certainly not the least:
4. The Dashanami Sannyasins who have propagated Advaita Vedanta to all corners of India (if not the world) owe allegiance to these Four Maths.
-"Saraswati", "Puri" and "Bharati" belong to the Sringeri Math; "Tirtha" and "Asrama" belong to the Dwaraka Math; "Giri", "Parvata" and "Sagara" belong to the Jyotir Math; "Vana" and "Aranya" belong to the Puri Math.

Rules of the Chaturamnaya Mailing List
--------------------------------------

The list has exactly one purpose - to study with reverence the teachings of the Chaturamnaya Maths.

The focus of the list will remain firmly on the teachings of the Chaturamnaya Maths, but there will be no restrictions on the discussion of any topic related to Vedic Dharma - including views opposed to the teachings of the Four Maths - provided it is accepted that the AUTHORITY OF THE CHATURAMNAYA MATHS ON ANY TOPIC IS FINAL. That is, rival or opposing views can be discussed on the list, with the caveat that the last word on the topic will be that of the Four Maths.

It is requested that list members try to limit their postings to no more than two per day.
