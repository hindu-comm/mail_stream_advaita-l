namaste,

Interesting read. Thanks for sharing.

I've read through a couple of commentaries on the rudra prashna in the past
(primarmily the commentaries by sayana and abhinava shankara). At the end,
I always end up wanting more.

You quoted abhinava shankara --
"भगवतश्चेतनाचेतनात्मक-सकलप्रपञ्चरूपत्वमुपवर्णितम्", and most commentaries
treat the majority of the prashna in the same way. i.e. a mostly random
collection of adjectives describing the vishvarupa.

I would expect some stronger per-anuvAka themes, and some stronger
connections between succesive adjectives. Can anyone point me to a work
that attempts to draw out these connections?

sasneham,

    ajit
