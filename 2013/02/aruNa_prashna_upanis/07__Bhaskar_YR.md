sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for the clarification.  Infact I did not know that aruNa has been 
imported from kAThaka shAkha to taittireeya AraNyaka.  Prabhuji, could you 
please clarify what would be the purpose behind this shifting of maNtra-s 
from one shAkha to another?? 

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

PS :  Longtime back I had made a request for ghana text of sUryOpAsana 
maNtra, kindly look into it in your free time.  If the pada pATha is 
available for the same,  kindly send it to me prabhuji.  I am not so good 
at pada vingadaNa either.

It is from one SAkhA of yajurveda (kAThaka) to another yajurveda SAkhA 
(taittirIya).
This is well documented in the history of the veda SAkhA-s.
