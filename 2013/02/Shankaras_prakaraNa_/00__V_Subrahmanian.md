There are a number of prakaraNa texts that are traditionally held to
be authored by Shankaracharya.  Over a hundred years ago upon the
initiative of the 33rd Jagadguru of Sringeri many of these were
published from the Sri Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam.  These works were
commented upon in detail by very good scholars versed both in Sanskrit
and Tamil.  The works contain the original in Sanskrit, with word to
word meaning in Tamil and overall purport with notes, citations, etc.
in Tamil.  It is a fine source for sadhaka-s and students of Advaita
as these books give a comprehensive knowledge of Advaita.  As several
stotrams like the 'harimIDe',, 'gaurIdashakam', ' subrahmaNya
bhujangam', 'Rama bhujangam', etc. are directed to one or the other
devatA-s one gets a practical method of bhakti sAdhana coupled with
Vedanta since these very stotrams are excellent works on Vedanta.

After the Vani Vilas Press became defunct, there was a period when
these works were no longer printed.  An initiative by a Charitable
Trust based in Rajapalayam, Tamil Nadu, has remedied the situation by
publishing these books, in the same form/content but in new print.
The books are in 10 volumes covering all such stotrams/works.  The
Trust has subsidised the price to make it affordable to one and all.
