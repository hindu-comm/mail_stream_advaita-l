Is this an Advaita work?  There is a well-known Vishistadvaita text by 
this name.

Doing some research on the web I see that some people are 
ascribing a work called adhikarana ratnamala to Vidyaranya/Bharati Tirth 
but I have a feeling they have confused it other things.  Swami Vidyaranya 
under his purvashrama name Madhava wrote two works called jaiminiya 
nyayamala and vayasika nyayamala and autocommenteries called vistara on 
both.  They are synopses of the purvamimamsa and brahma sutras 
respectively describing the adhikaranas rather than each individual sutra. 
The adhikarana ratnamala follows the same scheme as the name suggests so 
perhaps that is why there is confusion.
