The eighteenth chapter of Srimad Bhagavad Geetha deals with Karma thyaga and KarmaSanyasa.All jivas are bound by Karma which is of three types -sathvic,Rajasic and Thamasic.
Giving up the fruit of action is Karma Thyaga and giving up the action itself is Karma Sanyasa.Sanyasam is renounced order of life.Thyagam is renunciation of results of material activity.Sri Krishna explains the subtle differences between the two and lists the exceptions which should not be renounced. If you put a tabulation and write down the attributes for Sanyasa and Thyaga as told by The Lord I think a better understanding will emerge.R.Krishnamoorthy.
