All actions arises from desire. If one has completely renounced, there can
be no motivation whatsoever to act. One may act for the welfare of the
world only when one has assumed the notion, born of maya or avidya, that
there exists a world and its welfare is desirable. It may be a good thing
to do and may not affect the jnanam of Ishwara or Jnani but cannot be
called the svarupa of either. It seems the body and mind continue to act
even after the rise of aparoksha jnana because the karma vasanas exist
or the result of Ishwara sankalpa.

I dont think the absolute state is possible or to be aspired for. Instead
one should perform vaidhika karma and bhakti as far as possible.
