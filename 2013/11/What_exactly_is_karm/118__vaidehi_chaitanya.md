Hari om

Here is a humble  attempt  to share my understanding for which I may
probably draw examples from our own life to bring home the point where
 confusion is predominant in  many of us. i wish to  put it using our daily
life experiences. application of the knowledge with reflection in every day
action is mananam which Adi Shankaracharyaji emphasises on the path  to
perfection. let me try with humble pranams to all the seekers and Adi
Shankaracharyaji.


The child begins to crawl before walking using the same two legs. however,
it does not mean that child has forgotten the act of crawling. even when we
grow as adults, we all can crawl. but we do not as we have overcome that
phase naturally to leap into greater and efficient way of locomotion.  in
this case, both crawling  and walking are actions that are performed, can
be performed  and will continue to be performed. however, after I become
adept at walking i do not think that 'i am walking'. it is inseparable from
me even though it is an act. however,  I do not see it as an act. and, even
though I know crawling, i have given up crawling for, I do not need it any
more. similalrly, when I learn the advantages of working with karma phala
tyaga, I do with ease. But, so long as I have to learn, I am conscious of
it - I must not hold on to the fruits of action. After  the very process of
karma phala tyaga becomes natural and one with me, I also begin to see the
next level of evolution in performing karma. i.e. I am not the doer.
initially, I am conscious of the thought that ' i am not the doer' but
slowly, as the mind evolves and relaxes while performing the karma/
actions, it gives up the thought of 'i am the doer of the karma'. just as I
am walking is not a thought any more even though I walk, walking and will
continue to walk.
