Again, same question can be asked -- wouldn't a jnAni know other ajnAni-s
are equally  unreal just as bhagavAn (even though svarUpa of both bhagavAna
and ajnAni-s re brahman).

So, same question as Sri.Rajaram asked -- why should a jnAni should listen
unreal bhagavAn for the betterment of equally unreal ajnAni-s?
