The answer exists in the cited verse itself:  it is for the benefit of the
ajnani-s.  He should not unsettle the belief of the samsarin-s who act
based on their faith in the veda.

And regarding the proposal:
// I dont think the absolute state is possible or to be aspired for.//

it should be noted that such a proposition is against the Upanishad
itself.  The Taittiriya Up. for instance teaches: brahmavit Apnoti param.
The knower of Brahman attains the Supreme.  And that Supreme is the
absolute taught in various upanishads as Sat, bhUmA (Chandogya 6 and 7th
chapters), Turiya of the mAnDUkya, etc.  All these Upanishads specify the
Supreme as the Absolute as the attainable goal and describe the means to
attain that as well.  So, if it were not possible to attain That, the
Upanishads cannot be held to be pramANa.  They also ask one to aspire for
That: 'tad vijijnAsasva tat brahma' [Seek to know That, that is Brahman] in
the Taittiriya.  After delineating the various objects / goals of the
world/other world as seekable, aspirable, if we can use these terms,
Yajnavalkya demonstrates to Maitreyi that the Self alone is the supremely
loveable and therefore that alone is worthy of seeking, aspiring for.  And
specifies the means: shravana manana and nididhyAsana.  And the Upanishads
also give cases of those who have attained the Absolute. Thus, there is no
room for the thinking that the Absolute is unattainable or that it is not
worthy of aspiring for.
