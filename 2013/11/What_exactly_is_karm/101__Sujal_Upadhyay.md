Namaste Sri Rajaram ji,

**
I dont think the absolute state is possible or to be aspired for. Instead
one should perform vaidhika karma and bhakti as far as possible.

In the absolute state, i.e. Nirvikalp samAdhi, it is said that one can
remain only for 21 days, as far as common men are concerned.

Ishvara may bring down Enlightened Jnani so that he can be a part of divine
plan.

Some keep body but do not play active role to uplift humanity, some use
their siddhis, some do not, all according to divine plan.

If absolute state is not possible, then what about shastra-s talking about
them. It *must* be practically possible, even today, else there is no
concept of Jivan Mukta.

Shouldn't be the top most non-dual state, be a goal from day one. The goal
is not dependent upon your current mental state and purity. You may go step
by step by doing karma and bhakti, but the goal always has to be the
absolute state.

If you have no goal to be in samadhi, then you will remain satisfied in
doing karma and bhakti and find satisfaction in doing so. Remember arjuna
said, 'Give what is best for me' and Bhagavan advised him to do karma
without attaching to the fruits.

OM
