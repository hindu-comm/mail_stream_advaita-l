Namaste

Thank you. Very clear explanation. You are saying Karma Tyaaga itself is
required not Karma Phala Tyaaga. All Karmas have to be stopped. But there
is a problem.

We can see so many Sannyasis today going to inaugurate hospitals, colleges,
schools, and doing so many activities. They are participants in Homa
Purnahutis also. They are doing Laukika and Vaidika Karmas. Why?
