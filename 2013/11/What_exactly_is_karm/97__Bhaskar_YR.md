We can see so many Sannyasis today going to inaugurate hospitals, 
colleges,
schools, and doing so many activities. They are participants in Homa
Purnahutis also. They are doing Laukika and Vaidika Karmas. Why?

praNAms Sri Venkatesh prabhuji
Hare Krishna

IMO, gracing the occasions like attending pUrNAhuti-s, performing the 
nityAnushtAna in the newly built house during gruhapravesha function, 
doing nAma saMkeerta at public places, cutting the tap to inaugurate the 
buildings etc.  by the mathAdhipati saNyAsi-s might be part of their 
'dharma prachAra.  Moreover, mere presence of these saNyAsi mathAdhipatis 
during these loukika / vaidika karma-s/functions, would bring the soothing 
feeling for the followers of these samiji-s / matha-s.  So, IMHO,  these 
activities cannot be strictly termed as karma-s which is being executed by 
sarva karma saNyAsi-s.  These activities can only be termed as steps they 
have taken to do the 'dharma jAgruti' in loukika-s like us. 

But I do agree with you, nowadays, inviting peethAdhipati-s for 
Asheervachana / pAda pUja etc. have become a big commercial dealing, The 
host has to pay exorbitantly in the form of 'guru kANike' to the followers 
/ close associates of these matha-s / swAmiji-s.  There will be a 
pre-fixed price for all these events.  And for these debatable practices I 
dont think I can give you a satisfactory or convincing answer.  Might be 
management staff of these religious institutions have their own 
justification for this also. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
