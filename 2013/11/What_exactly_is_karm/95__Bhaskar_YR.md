sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Kindly pardon me I have changed the subject line. 


I have observed two different observations with regard to 'karma saNyAsa'. 
 Firstly Sri sada prabhuji said : 

// quote//

That understanding is sarva karma sanyaasa â€“ it is not really renouncing 
actions that I never did or do, but renouncing the notion that I am doer. 
These notions will get removed only in the awakening of the true knowledge

//unquote//

indicating that 'karma saNyAsa' is NOT exactly about renouncing the 
physical action itself (agnihOtrAdi vaidikAdi karma-s) but it is ALL about 
renouncing ONLY katrutva bhAva of the doer. 

But  your goodself, subsequently  clarified as below :

// quote //

There comes a point when one has to move beyond performance of karmA along 
with
phala-tyAga to the stage where there is sarva karma saMnyAsa, which means 
ultimately
giving up all vaidika and laukika karmA. This is what Sankara bhagavatpAda 
emphasizes
time and again. 

// unquote//

AFAIK, sri shankara insists 'karma saNyAsa' (physically renouncing the 
loukika & vaidika karma-s)  in geeta bhAshya NOT exactly 'katrutva 
saNyAsa'.  Hence at somany places he stresses the importance of taking the 
formal saNyAsa when pursuing the path of knowledge.  However as Sri Sada 
prabhuji pointed out as a sAdhana part we have to practise the akatrutva 
bhAva while doing the karma when we are in other than saNyAsa Ashrama & 
these aktrutva karma-s  ultimately lead us to karma saNyAsa (physical 
renunciation of loukikAdi karma-s) automatically.  So, as per shankara 
bhAshya 'karma saNyAsa' means NOT exactly katrutva saNyAsa it is nothing 
but renuncing the 'karma' itself.  And this karma saNyAsa can be achieved 
to its fullest effect ONLY in saNyAsa Ashrama. 

Sri Vidya prabhuji, kindly correct me if I said anything wrong.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
