Dear Srirudra,

This same Q was posted in my blog also below my article. Let me paste my
answer-

When a person is trying to understand the world and God from Vyavaharika
dasha, then we can see Brahman as both inhabiting the world and also is
above the world. Hence, Isha Upanishad describes Brahman in the same verse
as “Paryaagaat” and “Paribhuh”.

In the verse 5, this is made clear when it is stated “tat antarasya
sarvasya tadu sarvasya baahyataha/it is inside of everything and outside of
everything also”. This is how Brahman should be understood by a person who
is still in Samsara. The very next two verses describe how a Jnani
perceives the Reality. A Jnani says his Atman alone in all objects and all
objects in his Atman. For, such a Jnani in whom all objects have become his
Atman, no dualities exist, Oneness alone remain.

Hence, as you rightly pointed out, from the Absolute/Paramarthika Dasha,
Brahman alone exist, neither creation nor dissolution exist. Hence, when it
is said world is manifested by Brahman, it is not “creation” of a real
entity. Instead it an appearance, similar to a magic elephant conjured by a
magician.

Now, to your Q, what is the need for such a manifestation? From the
absolute standpoint, this Question is of no value because Brahman the very
“Existence”, he is devoid of any duality and is “Everything”. Hence, he
does not need anything else to achieve. People perform actions to achieve a
goal. But, Brahman who is devoid of actions, and is Self-Existent is devoid
of any desires or goals. For this reason, this apparent manifestation of
Universe is neither to achieve some goal nor as an
entertainment/sport/Krida. For, Brahman is Ananda/Bliss itself and hence he
requires no “Krida”. So, the only answer that remains is- “It is the very
nature of Brahman to manifest as Universe”. It is his play- a Lila.

So, because this Manifestation is only his Lila/play, no question of need
or use arise.

Let me further add that-

When, Jagat is explained as "Mithyam", Mithya does not mean Non-Existence
like the son of barren woman. It means being temporary and without
Independent Existence apart from Brahman. The existence of Jagat is similar
to Snake that is mistake for a rope or a magic elephant conjured by a
magician. In other words, as long as we are in Samsara, this Universe is
Real to us. Hence it is called as Vyavaharika Satya. Instead of rejecting
the whole Universe, one must recognize that it is Brahman who inhabits the
Universe as its Atman. The world of names and forms are golden ornaments.
Just as Gold is real nature of both gold ring and necklace so also beneath
all names and forms, Brahman alone exist. Understanding thus, one must
strive to Realize this first hand or "Aparoksha Jnana". Only at the dawn of
Jnana that, all dualities, all Maya ceases to exist.

Hence, any explanations about Nirguna or Saguna we find in Scriptures are
used only for the purpose of Instructions.


Regards,

Nithin
