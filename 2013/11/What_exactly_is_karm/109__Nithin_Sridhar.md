It must also be kept in mind that, Saguna Brahman and Nirguna Brahman are
not "Two Brahmans". It is same Brahman who in Reality is Nirguna, appears
by his own Maya as Saguna Brahman. In other words, when Brahman is
understood in his Absolute state, he is called Nirguna and when Brahman is
understood in his aspect of manifestation, he is called as "Saguna Brahman".

I would like to share these two pieces I wrote sometime ago-

Nature of Brahman-
