Namaste
Some people say we should say the Veda Mantras without Kampana. I heard
some people are saying Mantras with trembling voice. The shaking voice is
Kampana. It is a Dosha to be avoided by Vaidikas. Many people in South
India are saying Yajur Veda and others with a shaking voice. It is pleasing
to hear but it is a defect. In music concert the musician sometimes will
sing with shaking voice. It gives a nice effect and enjoyment to listeners.
But in Veda it is not allowed. Some very old Vaidikas will have a trembling
voice in saying Mantras.

Kampanam Naama Svaraashrita Paathadoshaha Praayena Daakshinatyaanaam
Bhavati. Tam Upalakshya Sa Varjyaha.

Trans - The Kampana is a Defect in recitation of Svaras. Mostly it is
present in South Indians. They must observe it and avoid it.

Trembling voice is caused by shaking vocal cords.

'Vocal tremor is caused by trembling or shaking vocal cords. Most vocal
tremor may be a component of neurologic essential tremor, though other
neurologic disease can also cause tremor.

Generally seen in an aging population, voice tremor causes the voice to
take on a wavering, unsteady quality.'
