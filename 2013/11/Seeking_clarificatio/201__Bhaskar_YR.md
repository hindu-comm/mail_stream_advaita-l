BTW, if you have determined that your guru is from a traditional gurukulam
and is a good teacher (which I assume you must have since you are learning
from him), you should just follow what he says and not solicit advice from
people you don't know, especially on the internet. 

>  My Rigveda teacher is just around 20 years old and a fresher from 
shrungeri pAthashAla. He has learnt kramAnta and he almost knows & recite 
all saMhita maNtra-s by heart.  But I dont think he knows the rules of 
svara-s & Sanskrit grammar in detail.  Recently we both went for some veda 
pArAyaNa programme, where we had to recite maNtra-s with some other 
ritviks, others just recited those maNtra-s with svarita whereas we both 
recited those same maNtra-s with deergha svarita.  You know how it would 
be when same maNtra has been recited with different svara-s in a sabha!!. 
Later on I asked him about this difference, he could not explain it in 
detail, he just said it is pAtha bedha, but I didnot think that way since 
those other ritviks have learnt these maNtra-s in our style only i.e. 
shrungeri pAtha !! 

I realize that I am shooting myself in the foot somewhat, given my 
previous reply. But just
take it as a friendly suggestion.

>  Thanks for your kind suggestion prabhuji.  I thought,  by asking this 
question in forum I would get more authentic answer. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
