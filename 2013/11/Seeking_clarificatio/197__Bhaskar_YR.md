Kindly clarify whether we have to recite following Riks with deergha 
svarita or svarita :

01.  vAya ukthebhirjarante tvAmachhA jaritAraH - (ashtaka -1, adhyAya-1, 
sUkta-2, varga-3) here 'bhir' in ukthebhiH should have deergha svarita or 
svarita??
02.  nAsatya vruktabarhishaH - (ashtaka-1, adhyAya-1, sUkta-3, varga-5) 
here also same doubt whether barhishaH should have deergha svarita or 
svarita??

Liwewise in 'manurhitaH' (sUkta-13) manurhitOgne (sUkta-14), 
dhyubhiraktubhirhitaM (sUktka-34, adhyAya-3)

In printed version of Kannada Rigveda saMhita (Ramakrishna Mission 
publication) these mantra-s have only 'svarita'.  But my teacher asked me 
to make correction.  But when I heard 'saMhita' recitation elsewhere, only 
'svarita' used while reciting these maNtra-s.  I think we cannot say it is 
pAtha bedha, because 'svara' itself differs in these maNtra-s.  Kindly 
clarify.  My special request to Sri Vidya prabhuji and Sri Ananda Hudli 
prabhuji. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
