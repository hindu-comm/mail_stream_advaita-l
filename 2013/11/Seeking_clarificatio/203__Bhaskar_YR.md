Here, the svara should be svarita rather than dIrghasvarita. However, in 
the Vishnu sUkta of the second adhyAya,the svara should be dIrghasvarita 
at the end of viShNur (ato devA avantu no yato viShNurvichakrame). Again, 
in sUkta 26, varga 20, the svara on the "a" in aryamA (varuNo mitro 
aryamA) should be dIrghasvarita. Note that in these two cases, the svara 
occurs before semivowels, but not in the cases that you cited. I vaguely 
remember a rule regarding this but I cannot find it with the limited 
access I have currently to my texts.

Anand
