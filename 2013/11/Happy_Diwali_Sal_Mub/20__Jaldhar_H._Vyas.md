Yes though the names are only used in samkalpa.  For everyday purposes the 
years are numbered from the accession of King Vikramaditya in 57BC hence 
this era is called Vikram Samvat.  Elsewhere in India, the VS era is 
chaitradi but the Gujarati Vikram Samvat is unusual in that it is 
kartikadi.  This means the VS year name will be out of sync with that in 
TN though the same set of 60 names are used.

This calendar is also used in Gujarat to a lesser extent.  It is known as 
Shalivahan Shaka.  Presently the SS year is 1935.

To be on the safe side, I repeat the names and numbers of both the Vikram 
and Shalivahan years during samkalpa.
