Rao gaaru - PraNAms

It is a very good reference. 

For moksha only jnaana is the means as per advaita. Proper satvic tapas will help in chitta suddhi required for shravana, manana and nidhidhyaasa 
Hari Om!

 I suggest Amarakosham for etymological meanings. Web
 source is 

 http://vedabase.net/t/tapah. Here all references from
 Gita are available.

 Tapah is towards a desire to be fulfilled. It does not
 appear in any of the moksha Margas as I understand.
 Shravana, ma√±ana, nidhidhyasa are the routes.
