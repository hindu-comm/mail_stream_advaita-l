Hari om

If you are looking for references:

I suggest Amarakosham for etymological meanings.  Web source is 

http://vedabase.net/t/tapah. Here all references from Gita are available.

Tapah is towards a desire to be fulfilled. It does not appear in any of the moksha  Margas as I understand. Shravana, maÃ±ana, nidhidhyasa are the routes.

Most of tapas essentially involves with drawing the mind from dissipating pursuits and concentrating on one thing. Hence single pointed meditation is really tapas. It can be saatvic, rajasic or even tamasic depends on the object and the goal of the meditation. In law sometime it is called pre-meditative murder where one is meditating on the most tamasic or ausuric tendencies. mediation for purification of the mind is what is required for evolution. Krishna discusses these aspects in the 18th chapter.
