Namaste Sadaji,

This is a beautiful sloka from Bhartruhari to induce vairagya.

/////
In essence whatever the time one finds it make use of it to gain 
eternal unending happiness that does not depend on time
//////

The time or kAla is a discrete principle which consists of fragments.  The 
gap between two discrete fragments of time is called "sandhi-kAla". 

This "sandhi" is the Eternal Principle which is of the nature of Bliss Absolute. 
The purpose of sandhyAvandana is to merge with that Eternal Principle.  

The chief objective of the vAkya "ahar ahar sandhyAM upAseeta" is to tap
this Bliss Absolute only.

regs,
sriram
