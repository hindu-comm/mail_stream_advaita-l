Namaste,

We can create a google custom search engine (CSE) like the one I have
created here<https://www.google.com/cse/home?cx=017607476515012185699:vjumvvqy5ie>.
after entering search query, the results page has refinement labels, which
could further narrow the search. Morever, we can also try and add date
filters so that we can search archives in a certain filters.

an e.g.<https://www.google.com/cse/home?cx=017607476515012185699:b_owgx6xyi0>

There is an option of 'sort by' on right hand side.
Wiki<https://sites.google.com/site/beginnersearch/project-definition>

The catch is that only 16 filters can be created.

If anyone is a coder or a tech savvy, then he/she can take max advantage of
his skills and can create a much better CSE than I, as a non-coder, can
create.

Is anyone interested?

What kind of filters could be made in this case? Any thoughts?

OM
