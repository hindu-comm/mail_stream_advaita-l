Namaste Sri Sadananda and Sri Vidyasankar

If we have to discuss only Advaita here it is not possible. Because SILENCE
is the one and only way to teach Advaita. Dakshina Murthy is teaching
SILENCE only. All the doubts of the students are cleared by SILENCE only.

If you say Brahman I say  that word Brahman also is not describing real
Brahman. Because real Brahman cannot be called by any name. Real Brahman
has no name. A name is not real. Brahman word is not real. Thinking in this
way we have a conclusion. It is impossible to discuss Advaita. Because any
word will not reach Brahman. Yato Vacho Nivartante Aprapya Manasa Saha.
Kindly remember this.

What we can discuss? We have to discuss preparatory things for Advaita. How
we can become prepared for Advaita Sadhana? I once saw a email from Sri
Jaldhar He wanted to discuss Smarta culture and other things you can say
tangential to Advaita. But the tangential things are very necessary for
preparatory stage.

Like Sandhyavandana and some Nitya Karma. We have to do the Karma carefully
and avoid mistakes. I asked the Aruna Prashna question but nobody has given
the meaning of mantras where the pregnant ladies have to leave. What is the
meaning of those Mantras dangerous for babies in the womb. All are talking
about some other thing.
