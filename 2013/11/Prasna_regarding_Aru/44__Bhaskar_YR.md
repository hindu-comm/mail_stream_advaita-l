If living like Sanyasis why they are

Why
> they were sitting with pregnant women and saying mantras?

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

IMHO, just because there is an instruction to  the 'garbhiNi' in this 
mantra, we should not assume that vedic seers used to sit next to pregnant 
women and reciting these veda maNtra-s.  apakrAmata and yathAsthAnaM just 
an instruction for the pregnant, if she is there during aruNa parAyaNA, 
she has to avoid listenting to these maNtra-s..If we go by about 
assumption, then we have to say seers chanted injunction like maNtra-s in 
aruNa,  nAtra mUtra pureeshaM kuryAt, na vivasanasnAyAt etc. after 
witnessing these acts :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
