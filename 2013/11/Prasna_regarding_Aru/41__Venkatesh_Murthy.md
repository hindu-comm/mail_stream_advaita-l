Namaste

I have a question regarding Aruna Prasna. In one place they say
'Apakraamata Garbhinyaha' and after some Mantras they say 'Yathaasthaanam
Garbhinyaha'. Pregnant ladies must leave that place and come back after the
mantras are finished.

This Aruna Prasna is coming from Taittiriya Aranyaka. The Aranyaka portion
is for forest living people in ancient times. They lived like Sanyasis in
the forest and they studied Aranyakas. If living like Sanyasis why they are
saying pregnant women have to leave and come back after some mantras? Why
they were sitting with pregnant women and saying mantras?
