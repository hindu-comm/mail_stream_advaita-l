Namaste,

I am not qualified for to answer this topic, however, I have found
something that can be useful.

In he book, Hindu
Dharma<http://kamakoti.org/newlayout/template/hindudharma.html>,
there is a topic on child
marriage<http://kamakoti.org/newlayout/template/hindudharma.html/18/1/hindu/Marriage>
(Part
18), please check Eight Forms of
Marriage<http://kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part18/chap5.htm>and previous
two chapters

Interesting thing related to this topic is that mantras in marriage are
recited for all forms of marriage. Out of it one marriage Brahma Marriage
is conducted when girl has not attained puberty, but she goes to stay at
her husband's home when she is matured.

Mantras are said in advance.

Please find a quote below by Kanchi Paramacharya

I will give you an example in this context. When the brahmacarin performs
> the samidadhana he prays before Agni to grant him good children. How absurd
> would it be for our reformers to argue, on the basis of this prayer, that a
> young boy must have children when he is yet a celibate-student and that he
> may become a householder only later. The point to note is that the boy
> prays on advance for good children. The Vedic mantras cited by reformers
> must be seen in the same light.



> The mantras [quoted by reformers] are appropriate for the marriage of a
> girl who has come of age also.
> This is our reply to the school of opinion represented by the Rt Hon'ble

Coming back to the topic, in brahmacharya ashram, according to Kanchi
Paramacharya, everything is taught, including upanishads. i.e. samhitA,
brAhmaNa, araNyaka, vedAnta (upanishads), but after completing the
education, brahmacharin return to home and lives a life of house holder.

I think that the applications of teachings of various parts of veda-s
(samhitA, etc) are related to ashrams, but they are taught atleast on
philosophical or intellectual level since the first ashram.

I hope this is helpful.
