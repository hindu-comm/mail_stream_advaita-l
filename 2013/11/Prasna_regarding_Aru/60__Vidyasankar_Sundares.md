And if you notice, your early respondents did address the related questions. 
Yet, it would be far better for smoother functioning of this list if you articulated
the unseen questions appropriately.

This has been adequately addressed by Sri Venkata Sriram. The reality is that you
cannot assume anything one way or the other about what other people are doing.

However, it would again be far better if each of us worry about ourselves and our
actions, rather than think that someone else on the list is not doing nityakarmA
properly.



This list has a primary focus. Things like bhojyAbhojya vicAra, karmAnushThAna for
cittaSuddhi, etc have a place, but when these become the central concerns for long
discussion threads, that is a distraction/digression, not preparatory to our focus.
