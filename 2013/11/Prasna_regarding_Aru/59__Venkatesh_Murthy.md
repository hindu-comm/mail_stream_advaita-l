Your writing will make others to think I am interested in pregnant women
but not the mantras. I am saying this is not true. I think this list is not
so pin point accurate always. A question in some passage in the Veda must
be answered by taking entire context. A learned person will answer not only
one question but many in one message. He will see unseen questions and
tackle them. This is good.

Kindly read my message regarding Nitya Karma required for Advaita
discussion.

If A wants to discuss with B a Upanishad topic in this list there is
minimum requirement both A and B must be doing Nitya Karma like
Sandhyavandana regularly.  Otherwise there cannot be Advaita discussion. We
will have these situations -

A is doing but B is not doing Sandhyavandana. B may reply to A but it is
not fruitful because B is not eligible to discuss. A will be frustrated. He
cannot accept B's reply.

B is doing but A is not doing. A can discuss Advaita but it is not fruitful
because he is not eligible to discuss. B can be silent.

Both A and B are doing Nitya Karma. Then it is fruitful discussion.

Both A and B are not doing. What can I say? Advaita discussion is a waste
of time. They can have a chat about Politics, Sports and other things.

But there is ONE PROBLEM. I am doing Sandhyavandana daily. I cannot know
who is doing Nitya Karma in this list. It is IMPOSSIBLE.  If I want to
discuss I cannot do it. Because there is incomplete information regarding
others in this list.

What can I do? You tell me.
