Namaste,

As jaldharji has answered most of the part, would like to add a little to that.

Those specific mantras from aruNaM are deployed for easy and normal delivery. 
So, if pre-matured pregant ladies are in the vicinity of that "aruNa-chayana", there
is every danger of pre-mature delivery / abortions.

Hence, the warning to such ladies.  

Otherwise, there is no harm.  

regs,
sriram
