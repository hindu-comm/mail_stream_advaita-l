Namaste Sada Ji,

//////////

In stead of efforts being directed to wards understanding the absolute truth, 
attention is being directed to trivialities which has little to do 
with either sadhana or about the doctrine

//////////

True sada ji.  vedanta chintana is such a nectar that once tasted, one would not find 
interest in chit chats, timepass discussions.  There is a beautiful mantra from muNDaka 
upaniSad :

yasmindyauH prithivI chAntarikSamOtaM manaH saha prANaishcha sarvaiH
tamEvaikaM jAnatha AtmAnamanyA vAchO vimunchathAmrutasyaisha sEtuH

".......know Him to be the One Atman of all and abandon all other speech........"

regs,
sriram
