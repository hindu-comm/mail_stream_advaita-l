Sri Venkatesh,



I'm responding to your last point first.

I would have been inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt if your questions had
been, "What is the meaning of these sentences in the aruNa praSna, beginning with
ashTayonIm ashTaputrAm and ending with atha purushas saptapurushah? Why should
these not be recited in the hearing of pregnant women? Do these mantra-s affect the
expectant mother or the foetus negatively?"


Did you ask for any of this? I think everybody on this list knows that it was not so. Let

me remind you nevertheless.



Your questions were, and I quote verbatim, "If living like Sanyasis why they are saying
pregnant women have to leave and come back after some mantras? Why they were
sitting with pregnant women and saying mantras?"

Your bringing up the correct performance of nityakarmA is a specious argument here.
It just does not apply. You did not ask for advice about what to do when reciting the
aruNapraSna at home or in a public place in today's context. If you had asked that,
some may have thought that you had a genuine question about veda pArAyaNa in
the 21st century. But that was not what you asked either, was it?



You get answers for the questions you ask. If you want to know about one thing, do
not ask about some other thing. If you ask for some other thing, don't blame those
who give you answers about that some other thing. The history of your postings to 
the list shows that it is almost always about some other thing, not about the focus
topic of this list. And every once in a while, I get annoyed with it all and ask you why
you feel the need to ask the questions that you do ask.  Every once in a while, as a
moderator and a member of this list since its inception, it becomes my responsibility
to remind you that it would help this list and all its members, including you, if you
asked other questions instead of the ones you usually ask.

If you are already qualified enough to teach advaita through silence, may I urge you to
practice some of this teaching of silence yourself?

Thank you for reminding me about the importance of silence, after forcing me to break
my recent relative silence on this list!



Would you perhaps like to reach back in time and give the same advice about silence to
Sankara bhagavatpAda himself? The pages after pages of bhAshya that he wrote on the
prasthAna traya and additional pages on independent texts were all about something
other than advaita, right? It would have to be so, because in your book, it is impossible
to discuss advaita. We can only discuss marriage, pregnancy, food, politics and other
such topics.



And we have to feel sorry for all those poor deluded disciples of Sankara, down through
the generations, right? They wrote even more, and kept speaking, down to this day,
instead of just sitting silent. Or talking about all sorts of topics under the sun instead,
anything except advaita.

Really? Raising idle questions about the presence of pregnant women in forests, along
with speculation about how Rshi-s of the AraNyaka-s lived, is relevant to smArta culture, 
performance of nitya karmA and preparatory to sAdhana towards advaita? How?
