Although because it is typically resorted to in old age it is unlikely, it is not impossible that a a vanaprasthi could be pregnant. Furthermore the vanaprastha does not live like a sannyasi in that he is still a member of society.  Do we not read in itihasa-purana about householders visiting the forest or students going to learn there? Why could not a visitor be pregnant?  It's a moot point really because according to dharmashastras, vanaprastha ashram is varjya in the Kali yuga.

My thinking is this is not correct.Do you think our forefathers were so dull headed as to believe sun to harm the foetus.There is no such record.Karna was born to Kunti by invoking the Manthra  directed to Sungod.Perhaps it requires more research to find out the real reason for such instruction.

For example Gargi Vachaknavi is a princess of Videha who asks pointed questions to Yajnavalkya. (Brhadaranyaka 3.8)  Shankaracharya refers to her as a jnani.  But she asks the assembled brahmanas for permission to ask.  Maitreyi the wife of Yajnavalkya is called a brahmavadini but is specifically contrasted with her co-wife Katyayini who only has "stri prajna"  It would be more accurate to say that women did not by and large participate in such discussion but when they did, their questions were taken seriously not dismissed.
