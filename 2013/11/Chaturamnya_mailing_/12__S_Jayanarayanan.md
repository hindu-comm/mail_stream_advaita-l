The main reason for the new list is that about a BILLION people directly or indirectly follow the teachings set by the Chaturamnaya Maths. Even if someone is a follower of the Ramakrishna Math or Chinmaya Mission, they readily admit tracing their Guru-Shishya parampara to one of the Chaturamnaya Maths:
http://www.sringeri.net/2007/04/28/news/monks-of-ramakrishna-math-call-on-jagadguru.htm
"Monks of Ramakrishna Math call on Jagadguru
The Ramakrishna Math holds the Dakshinamnaya Sri Sharada Peetham as the Guru Peetham. On 27th April 2007, a group of monks from the Ramakrishna Math, Bangalore headed by President of the Math, Swami Harshananda along with a few Brahmacharis had Darshan of the Jagadguru and received His Blessings."

"ACHARYAS OF CHINMAYA MISSION
Guru Parampara
Adi Shankaracharya established the Dashanami Sannyasa Order, a monastic order with ten lineage names. Of these, Chinmaya Mission belongs to the lineage and traditions of the 'Sringeri Matha' in Karnataka, India."

The list is a "Satsang" group for the followers of the Maths.

Namaste

IMHO there is no strong need for separate mailing list for Chaturamnaya.
All 4 Maths are teaching Advaita only. Why different lists? In this mailing
list Advaita of Adi Sankara is discussed. But the Maths are also teaching
Sankara Advaita Vedanta only. They cannot teach different from Adi Sankara.
Nobody is opposing Adi Sankara's Maths in this mailing list.
