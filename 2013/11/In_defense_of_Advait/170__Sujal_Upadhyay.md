P.Y.S refer to Patanjali Yoga Sutra :)

कृतार्थ प्रति नष्टमऊयनष्ट तदन्यसाधारणत्वात्‌ ॥ २२ ॥
2.22 Though the object of experience becomes unreal to him who has reached
the state of liberation, it remains real to all otehr beings.

P.Y.S. by Swami Prabhavananda of Ramakrishna Ashram, Page 90

Another translation.

2.22 For the one who has attained the goal [of liberation, the seen]
disappears [yet, the seen] is not destroyed because of it's common
universality.

krta = done
arthan = purpose, goal
prati = towards, for
naSta = destroyed
api = even though
anaSTam = not destroyed
tad = that
anya = other
sAdhAraNatvAt = because of, due to commonality, universality

Kriya Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and the Siddhas by Marshal Govindan, Page, 86

The author has also connected it with Thirumandiram.

Nitin: This was written on an impulse in reply to someone who was
criticizing Advaita. :)

Though article was written as an impulse, it can be refined when our head
is cool. I did the same with my website :). We can leave the article for a
few days and some back again to edit it.

Adi Shankara in his Gita BhASya teaches us not to leave our svadharma. This
is reflected in his commentary on verses 3.35, 4.13, 18.41 - 46,48 which
talk about varNa dharma.

It's too big to copy paste, please visit

search for 'Lets
talk them in brief w.r.t. Shankara BhASya'
Nitin: About Varna, you are right.But, today the system is so much
corrupted and people have forsaken Dharma that, Birth no longer is in line
with Guna.

I know, but guNa is present in sub-conscious mind. So if a Brahmin takes up
his original job of learning and doing karma kand, then we will be able ot
grasp subject easily. One may also feel rush of spiritual energy, as a
Brahmin is authorized to perform our karma. God never says what to do. He
has given us intellect, which can be a boon or a curse. God has also given
us Free Will :)

nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
