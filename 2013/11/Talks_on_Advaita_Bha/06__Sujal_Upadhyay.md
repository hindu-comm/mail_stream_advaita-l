original teaching of Adi Shankara

Correct statement is

Again, any definition of mithyA, which is other than illusion is not
considered as the original teaching of Adi Shankara,

nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
