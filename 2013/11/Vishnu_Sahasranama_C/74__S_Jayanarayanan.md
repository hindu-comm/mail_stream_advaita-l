Excerpt from the Introduction to "Sri Vishnu Sahasranama" by Swami Tapasyananda:
"Today of all Sahasranamas, the Vishnu-sahasranama is known as "the Sahasranama". It is the most widely chanted by people in all stations, and besides there are cassettes made of it as rendered by well-known artistes. According to orthodox Hindu tradition, a devoteee should daily chant the Upanishad pertaining to his Sakha, the Gita, Rudram, Purushasukta and Vishnu-sahasranama. It is believed that if he cannot do all this on any day, chanting Vishnu-sahasranama alone is sufficient. It is open to all to chant it, without any distinction of caste, creed or sex. It can be chanted at any time and no special rituals are obligatory on one chanting it. It is also interesting to note that in some parts of India students are asked to learn by heart the Vishnu-sahasranama when they begin Sanskrit studies."
