Dear Scholars,

I read that Sankaracharya refers to 34 brahma vifyas in his works where as
Ramanujacharya to 32. I would like to know the purpose of Brahma Vidyas. My
understanding is that it is for saguna brahmopasana and sakshAtkAram.I
would like to know if there is a critical study and successful practioners
today.

Best Regards
Rajaram Venkataramani
