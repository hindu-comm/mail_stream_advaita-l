Thank you. I too thought the proof for soul is from shastras only and resisted attempts to establish by logic. However, in ikyamyadhikarana acharyal uses only logic to help lokayakas (materialists) understand soul. If science points to an independent soul, will it not be better for modern times?

atma means "self" as well as "soul." While the existence of self is, shall 
we say, self-evident :-), the pramana for soul like any other adhyatmic 
topic is from shastra only.
