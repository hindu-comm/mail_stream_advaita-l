For someone 322 years old, your views are not so old fashioned. 

We  use science in every day life and believe in its methods without being conscious of it. Atmatattva has better chance of success in being understood if it is presented scientifically. I don't see why scientists should accept any scripture because they use other pramanas. They don't rely much on sabda as a primary source of knowledge. It is hard to establish sabda pramana as doubt is the natural state of affairs for modern minds.

Rajaram: If science points to an independent soul, will it not be better
for modern times?

I think the reverse should be true. If shastras say something, science has
to accept it. Before a century ago, science did not accept that there is
something called as 'mind' - mind it ;)

Now they have a main stream science dedicated to study of mind and it is
the most successful business and safe too ;) - psychologist
and psychiatrist.

Was science at a loss for all these years? Is mind a great great great
hypothesis?

As far as mind is concerned, modern medical science is a toddler. In
ancient times, we have hear stories of asura-s and dAnava-s conquering
heaven. All these happened in sukshma sharira, as far as I understand. Even
dAnava-s knew that they had more than one body (physical body), now who is
going to believe that we have 5 kosha-s (bodies). Does science accept it or
does it considered as paranormal. Is ayurveda considered main stream
science or is it considered as alternative therapy?

Their's is superior, ours is not, definitely not until they give us a nod -
mind it ;)

Do I sound like old man. I am just 322. You can call me old fashioned. I
will take it as a compliment. We are not at all proud of our culture and of
our country. I am pained whenever I hear 'According to Hindu Mythology ..',
perhaps puranas have an element of imagination, but they are much better
then history taught in schools. Purana-s give value education and the
'moral of the story is always good'. Thye mould our character of our kids.
they may have symbolic, esoteric meaning and connect us with God.
