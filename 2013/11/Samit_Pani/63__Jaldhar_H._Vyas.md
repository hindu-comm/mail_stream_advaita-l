First thing, were these six actually jnanis?  Prashna 1.1 describes them 
as brahmaparA brahmaniShTA.h paraM brahmAnveShamANA ("intent on brahman, 
abiding in brahman, seeking the highest brahman") so they were certainly 
advanced but perhaps not at the top level. E.g. They were "seeking the 
highest brahman." and after all they are coming to PippalAda to resolve 
their doubts.

The answer according to the upanishad itself is F.  (It could also be E 
but I'm going by what the tikakar has said according to Shri 
Subrahmanian.)

tAnha sa R^iShiruvAcha bhUya eva tapasA brahmacharyeNa shraddhayA 
saMvatsaraM saMvatsyatha yathAkAmaM prashnAnpR^icchata (1.2 first part.)

"That Rishi said to them, '[though you have already done so] live 
with me again for one year with tapas, brahmacharya, and faith then ask 
me as many questions as you please.'"

Although standards have fallen and most only do this perfunctorily isn't 
samiddana part of the upanayana samskara that marks the entry into 
brahmacharya ashrama to this very day?  Isn't it a recognized part of the 
nityakarma of a brahmachari according to all dharmashastras?

Elsewhere in this thread other posters have given explanations of how this 
is a symbol of some sort.  To which Bhaskar replied:

I agree with this.  Shankaracharya explains in his prashnopaniShadbhAShya 
that this whole story of the asking of questions and their answer is an 
arthavada for the purpose of glorifying vidya. 
(R^iShiprashnaprativachanAkhyAyikA tu vidyAstutaye )  It indicates that 
jnana is earned by tapas, brahmacharya, and shraddha, serving at the feet 
of a sarvajna guru.  As with arthavada in general, a specific situation is 
used to illustrate a more general principle.

Grhasthas do not perform the samitdana of a Brahmachari either.  But they 
are given the samit because acharya is the one who teaches achara.  It is 
from the acharya that the brahmachari will learn what to do with the 
samit.  So it is a sign of vinaya (good manners and conduct) to present 
the teacher with the implements of learning.  What ashram the teacher 
himself belongs to and whether he can use them himself or not is not 
relevant.

Note that it is relevant to quote the muNDakopaniShadbhAShya in this 
regard because the muNDaka and prashna have a close relationship.  The 
former belongs to the saMhitA of the atharvaveda and the latter to the 
brAhmaNa.  The cover the same topics.

I thinks this finally settles the subject.
