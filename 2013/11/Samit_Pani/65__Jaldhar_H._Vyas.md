Just clearing up some loose ends.

If we examine the geographical terms in the upanishads, they seem to take 
place in the belt from the land of the Kuru-Panchalas (modern 
Haryana/Delhi environs) to Videha (modern Bihar) not the Himalayas.  While 
it can get cold in winter in this area it is hardly the same as the 
Himalayas.  So this explanation is a bit strained IMO.

My understanding is that nitya agnihotris typically have a separate 
agnishala either a room or free-standing structure where the garhaptya 
agni is kept burning. The other two shrauta agnis are produced from it at 
the time of yajnas.  The household fire or laukika agni which is used 
for cooking, heating etc. (or rather was prior to electricity) is not used 
for agnihotra and other shrauta rites but is used for e.g. vivaha and 
other sanskaras etc.  Which is why the latter are described in the grhya 
("household") sutras and not the shrauta sutras.  So again, the need to 
keep warm doesn't provide a good explanation for my samidhs are offered.

I'm sure there are also adhyatmic meanings for the act of samitpani.  I'm 
not arguing that "symbolism" is wrong only that it does not fully explain 
why this particular act was the basis of the symbolism.  Consider that 
madhuparka is also a ritual of offering to ones superiors amongst whom are 
ones acharya.  Why then is this not prominently featured in upanishadic 
accounts?  Because underlying the symbolism is the "practical" fact of 
brahmacharya being a necessary prelude to instruction in Vedanta.
