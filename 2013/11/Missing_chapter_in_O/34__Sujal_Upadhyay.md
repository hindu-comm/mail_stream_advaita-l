**Suppose you have a wrist watch lying somewhere. But the room is dark. So
you cannot stop it. What do you do. You switch on the light and without

Suppose you have a wrist watch lying somewhere. But the room is dark. So
you cannot spot it. What do you do? You switch on the light and without
delay, you see the wrist watch. darkness hides wrist watch which was
already present, while light shows you the watch, which was already present.

If I correct typos, I end up adding more info, hence I leave typos. I get
lost while writing, hence many times I do not remember what I have written.

I also request you and other members to please give link or quote from my
website, incase you find something that needs to be changed. I will make my
job easy.


Thank you.
