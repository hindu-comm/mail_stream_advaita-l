Dear Sujalji,

I had a quick look at your site. Good efforts. I could not quite agree with a couple of your comments. May be you would like to think about it. 

Firstly, It is true that the Devi Bhagavata is one of the 18 Manhapuranas. As regards the Bhagavata Purana, Vedavyasa composed it only after composing the Mahabharata, and that too at the advice of Narada. The Bhagavata purana is said to be the highest of the Puranas and Padma purana vouches for it. Padma purana, though composed earlier, could pass a comment on a later Purana by virtue of the pancha-lakshana, which allows the Puranas to keep them updated.

The second comment was "Brahman can be described only in a negative way". Brahman has been described bothways. Mundaka does not do it in the negative way nor does the Lord when he says he would tell about the Parampada. 

Regards,
Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Namaste Sri Vidyashankar ji,

Thank you for taking time to visit my website. Thank you for correcting me.
I will change to 'Sri Sacchidanandendra Saraswati Swami of Holenarsipur'

Site is not complete and it needs guidance from knowledgeable members like
you and others in this mailing list.

Do let me know if you find anything that needs to be changed.

You can call me Sujal :)

Kind Regards

Aum
