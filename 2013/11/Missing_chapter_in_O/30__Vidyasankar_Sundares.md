Dear Sri Sujal Upadhyay,



Welcome to the list. I can see from your postings over the last few days that you will be making good contributions to the discussions here.



I would like to put in just a small comment about the Understanding Advaita website. Your write-up on the top page and in further links says "Sri Sacchidanandendra Saraswati Swami of Shringeri Math". I would recommend that you modify this to say "Sri Sacchidanandendra Saraswati Swami of Holenarsipur". 



While it is true that Sri Sacchidanandendra Saraswati Swami studied for a while with Shringeri Math pundits, he was not one of the Sankaracharyas of the Matha. He independently set up an institution called Adhyatma Prakasa Karyalaya in Holenarsipur, which operates on its own and is not controlled by Sringeri Matha. So, it would be best not to create confusion unwittingly amongst those who read about advaita and its lineages on the site, but do not have knowledge of the background details such as these.


With best regards,

Vidyasankar
