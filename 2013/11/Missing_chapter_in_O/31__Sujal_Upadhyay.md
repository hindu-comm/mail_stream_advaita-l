Namaste Sri Vidyashankar ji,

Thank you for taking time to visit my website. Thank you for correcting me.
I will change to 'Sri Sacchidanandendra Saraswati Swami of Holenarsipur'

Site is not complete and it needs guidance from knowledgeable members like
you and others in this mailing list.

Do let me know if you find anything that needs to be changed.

You can call me Sujal :)

Kind Regards

Aum

Sujal
