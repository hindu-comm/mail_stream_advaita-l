I can agree there are two paths Sankhya and Yoga in BG. The Sankhya is for
a Brahmachari taking Sanyasa directly without going into Gruhastha Ashrama.
When Brahmachari takes Sanyasa it is Vividisha Sanyasa. His mind cannot be
purified by Yajnas because he will not have the right to do Yajnas when he
is a Brahmachari. Yajnas require a wife. He will not have the right to do
Yajnas when he is Sanyasi also. What can he do? How can he purify his mind?
He can practice Yoga and meditation to make the Atma Jnana stronger and
stronger and finally become Jnana Nishtha. But he has used only Upanishad
part of the Veda to become a Jnani.

But a Gruhastha has every right to purify his mind with Nitya Karmas like
Sandhyavandana and many Yajnas. He can practice Karma Yoga. By Purification
of mind he will come to the door step of Atma Jnana. He can do Sravana,
Manana and Nididhyasana of Upanishad Vakyas and become Atma Jnani. He has
used all the portions of the Veda like Mantras, Brahmanas and Upanishads to
get Atma Jnana. Then he can take Vidvat Sanyasa.

In Br Up 4-4-22 Adi Sankara is explaining the path for Brahmana Gruhasthas.
They can get Atma Jnana easily by following Karma Yoga itself. By following
Karma they can come almost full distance to Moksha.

The tragedy is most of the Vyakhyana Karas have not understood the
concessions Adi Sankara has given to Brahmana Gruhasthas. They are all
misunderstanding the importance of Karma and saying silly things about
Karma like Karma is useless for Brahma Jnana. They are not realizing ALL
PARTS of Veda are important for Atma Jnana. Karma Kanda is not inferior
and  Upanishads are not superior. Both have a role.

Paramaarthataha yes there is no other person to see the Self. But in
Vyavahara I can say Self is hidden by coloured object Ajnana or sin and
have to get rid of it to see the Self. Karma will remove sin.
