Dear Sri Bhaskar prabhu ji,

I humbly request you to please continue doing nitya karma and pray to God
to show you the way. Rest leave it to God. God will also correct your
approach if it needs correction. Only catch is you will have to keep moksha
as the only goal of life and be open to change.

Good luck with your spiritual journey.

Hari OM

He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
