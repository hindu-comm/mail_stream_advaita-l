Namaste,

I fully agree with your 2 cent advice :)

The point was - keep that which is necessary. Nothing extra. But ours is a
demanding mind. What is the use offacebok a/c and email a/c and chat a/c
for a sanyAsin, when his all doubts are or can be cleared by his Guru and a
sanyasin is not a siddha, so he is not ordered to spread the word? Even
BrahmachAris have accounts.

Printed matter is better option then to read online. For a SanyAsin, he
must have a Guru and it is Guru's duty to give what his  disciple needs.
But what if disciple takes initiative on his own.

Aum

OM

nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
