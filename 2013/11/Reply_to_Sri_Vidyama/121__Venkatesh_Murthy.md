'I'? If I am thinking I am very happy by doing nothing but sitting and
meditating on OM there is no Atma Jnana because I still think I am the
meditating person. I am not realizing I am more than the meditating person.

If I do Nitya Karma like Sandhyavandana and Yajnas I will get a feeling
some time I am doing my duty and I am not attached to the Karma fruits. I
will realize I am more than the Karma doer and not restricted to the Karma.
But we should not stop doing the Karma by feeling over confident. We have
to keep on doing it till Atma Jnana comes on its own. Atma Jnana will come.
