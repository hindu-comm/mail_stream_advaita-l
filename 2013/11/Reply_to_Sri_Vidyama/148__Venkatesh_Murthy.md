Namaste

The Vidhis and Nishedhas are for the body but not for Atma. The Atma cannot
have any rules and regulations. When Adi Sankara was in Sannyasi body he
was following Sannyasi rules and regulations. When he entered King
Amaraka's body in Para Kaya Pravesha he was following the Khastriya rules
and regulations and enjoying with his wives and learning Kama Sastra. There
is no Papa and no Prayascitta required for this.

Similarly one person can Sanyasi now and in next Janma he can be a
householder.
