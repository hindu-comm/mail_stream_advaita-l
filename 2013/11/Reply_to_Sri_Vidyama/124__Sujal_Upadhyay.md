VM: Karma is of many types but Karma I am talking about is Nitya Karma

Please understand. Whatever has beginning has end. One day you began nitya
karma. Some day it has to end. It does not end in Jnana, but it ends in
purifies our chitta so that we qualify to realize our true nature.

Nitya karma requires specific external objects. What happens if you do not
have them? So you are dependent on something that is external for diving
deep within.

Forget shastra-s for some time being. What do you think, can you become
detached with the very karma that you are doing without stopping them. When
you are witness, can you act. When you are doing karma, are you
experiencing detachment? Do you meditate? if yes on what and how do you
meditate?

Afterall, if shastra-s has to be applied practically.

upanishads are also a part of veda-s
