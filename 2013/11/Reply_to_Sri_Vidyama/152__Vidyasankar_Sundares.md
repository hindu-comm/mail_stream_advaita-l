Let me clarify. I am not saying anything about saMnyAsa as an ASrama beyond
noting that formal entry into it is possible for the vividishA case. What I mean
about the giving up of karmA when jnAna arises, no matter the ASrama of the
person, is the following. This is admittedly a rare case, but if and when that
happens, the subsequent saMnyAsa is a matter of course. This is what is called
vidvat saMnyAsa. I do not mean to say anything else about the conduct of such
a person. In the case of formal saMnyAsa for the jignAsu, the giving up of karmA
is a means to realize one's intrinsic a-kartRtva. In the case of vidvat saMnyAsa,
a-kartRtva is already established.



It is only to accommodate both these possibilities that the jAbAlopanishat says,
brahmacaryAd vA gRhAd vA vanAd vA ... yad ahar eva virajet tad ahar eva
pravrajet.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
