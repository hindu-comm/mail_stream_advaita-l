Namaste

I also do not want to continue discussion of Para Kaya Pravesha. But I will
make a point. You are saying Yati should not do Nishiddha Karma in another
body because that Nishiddha Karma Phala will come to the Jeeva. But Adi
Sankara was not acting as a Jeeva in his own body and not in the King's
body also. He had lost Jeevatva because he was Brahma Jnani. He cannot be
Karta or Bhokta in any body.

He can occupy any body but he will never be Karta or Bhokta in that body.
He was Witness Consciousness only.  In his body of Yati he was witnessing
all events. In the King's body also he was witnessing all events. How can
he get Papa or Punya?

But if any ordinary Sannyasi quits his body without Brahma Jnana he will be
born again. You cannot say he is Patita if he gets a body and marries. Why?
Because when he is born he has to complete his Brahmacharya compulsorily.
He has not a choice. In Brahmacharya he is doing Karmas like
Sandhyavandana. Can you say he is Patita because he is breaking Sannyasa
rule of not doing Karma? Then he should not at all be born. But he is born.
He has to do Karma. Similarly he can marry after Brahmacharya because the
choice is offered to him.
