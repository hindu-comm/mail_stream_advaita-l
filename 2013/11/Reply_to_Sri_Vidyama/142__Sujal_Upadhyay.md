Namaste Sri Bhaskar Prabhu ji

Hare Krishna !!!

I believe in stop talking and start walking
. Rather than just keep talking about how to reach Delhi and how odes Delhi
look like, better start walking. No matter what the road is a longer route
or shorter route, no matter what sadhana we have (aeroplane, car or 11 No
bus - walking ;) ), we must start walking. Sooner or later we will reach
Delhi *if* we start walking.

Road map is necessary, we should not forget that road map cannot give you
darshan of Delhi. We will have to walk according to road map to reach it.

Sri Ramakrishna says,

In todays life (kali yuga), not the whole of karma kand can be practised.
So cut the head and tail part and only focus on the middle thing (imp
thing).

Jai Shri Krishna

A devotee of a devotee

"To disconnect from the self and to become Aware of anything else is
nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
FAITH IS LIFE, DOUBT IS DEATH - Sri Ramakrishna
