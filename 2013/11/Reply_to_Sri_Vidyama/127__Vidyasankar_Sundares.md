So, what happened to your earlier stance that yajnAdi karmA-s are required for
realizing brahman AFTER the knowledge, ahaM brahmAsmi, has already arisen?



And please note that vidvat saMnyAsa is not something that is to be given or
taken. It just is, as the natural state of brahmanishThA. No karmA is possible
or even necessary as a step toward brahman realization for vidvat saMnyAsin-s.

Whence this "almost full distance"? What is the step involved in covering that
last remaining gap? Read further and go to Br Up 4-4-23, where the text says,
SAnto-dAnta-uparatas-titikshus-samAhitaH and read the bhAshya thereon,
where Sankara bhagavatpAda introduces the word saMnyAsa, highlighting the
importance he gives to this ASrama.



That said, going from brahmacaryASrama directly to saMnyAsa is a rarity. The 

typical path that would apply to most people is one of progressing through
the various ASrama-s, with saMnyAsa as the final stage. Everything prior to
that is preparatory. After saMnyAsa, how can yajnAdi karmA-s be possible,
whether as means to brahman realization or otherwise? A gRhastha, who is
attached to the performance of karmA till the very end, is not eligible for
saMnyAsa, either of the vividishA or the vidvat kind. Which means he is not
a brahmajnAnI, as he is still subject to kartRtva buddhi, one of the effects
of avidyA.

Which vyAkhyAna-kAras are you talking about here? None of the traditional
authors has misunderstood the importance of karmA for those who are not
ready for saMnyAsa. But at the end, there is an important step of the giving
up of all karmA, either through a formal renunciation process or as a natural
state of jnAna. At the end, jnAna stands apart from karmA.



The core concept of jnAna-karma-samuccaya vAda, that karmA is needed for
realizing brahman after the rise of upanishad-vAkyajanita jnAna, is utterly and
completely rejected by Sankara. If you think that those who talk about this are
mistaken when they seem to thereby devalue karmA, please go back to my first
question to you in this response.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
