H S CHANDRAMOULI

Dear Sri Vidyashankarji,.

I have a small correction to make in your reply. You say  <  Either way,
the process has to go through
a state where karmA is renounced, either formally in the traditional
conception of vividishA saMnyAsa
or as a matter of course, no matter what ASrama they find themselves in > .
Bhagavatpada is very clear that at this stage of one's sadhana it is
absolutely essential to take to sanyasa ashrama for reaching the Goal of
Brahma jnana( ref Brahma Sutra Bhashya 3-4-20. This also has cross
references to various shruti / smriti vakyas . It is only in exceptional
cases that this jnana arises even in persons ( like king Janaka or Vamadeva
for example ) who are in other ashramas but it is concluded that in such
cases they would have undergone the due process of sanyasa ashrama in one
of their earlier janmas.

Regards
