Please read the above again, carefully and see if the bhAshya supports your
stance that yajnAdi karmA is neeeded for realization of brahman AFTER the
rise of jnAna. Here the sequence is, yajnAdi -> saMskaraNam (i.e. citta Suddhi)
-> jnAnotpatti. The word apratibandena means "without obstacles". It does
not mean "automatically." The verb bhavishyati is future tense. yajna, dAna,
etc are actions that precede the rise of jnAna and have the effect of purifying
the mental make-up of the sAdhaka. The bhAshya does not say that these are
necessary or enjoined after the rise of jnAna in order to result in moksha. It is
like saying that by learning to add and subtract, a student gains the needed
skills that can lead to algebra and then to calculus. For an ace mathematician,
the ability to add and subtract need not be learned anew and practiced on
a daily basis.

Great. Isn't it curious how everybody seems to think they have understood
Adi Sankara perfectly, but for thousands of years before them, nobody really
understood him?!!

No, they are not saying the same thing. Yes, performance of yajnAdi karmA 
can remove many of the obstacles, but ultimately, the last obstacle to jnAna
shining forth is the kartRtva notion that gets superimposed on the Atman.
It is not possible to remove this final obstacle by yet more karmA, because
the performance of karmA presumes this very same kartRtva. In Sankara's
position, the realization of aupanishada jnAna is concomitant with full karma
saMnyAsa.

Obviously, the use of this metaphor for AtmadarSana is lost on you. When the
crystal is a separate object and what colors it is also another separate object,
and both are being seen by a separate drashTA, yes, action may be effective.
By what means, pray, is the person to see his own Self?
