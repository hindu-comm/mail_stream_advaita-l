Dear Bhaskar ji,

While I am not in disagreement with what you have said in this post,
regarding a jIva having been a sannyAsin in an earlier birth and a gRhastha
in a later birth, there is no shAstra-ullanghana involved.  *These happen
to different bodies, different janma-s, and not in the same body/janma of
the same jIva. * There is no guarantee as to what will be one's janma after
a particular janma.  It is the set of karmas that are ready to bear fruit
that will decide the subsequent janma.  *The shAstra niShiddha of not
coming to a lower ashrama from a higher one is for the same body/janma.*
The shastra cannot also make a prohibition of this kind since it would be
impossible for anyone to check/verify what Ashrama-s one has been in in the
previous births.

What is implied, however, in the inference that 'one has been a sannyasin
in an earlier birth' is that that samskAra required / conducive for
jnAotpatti is there in that person owing to such sannyAsa, albeit in an
earlier birth.  For, the rule: na hi kalyAnakRti kashchit durgatim tAta
gacchati' is inviolable.
