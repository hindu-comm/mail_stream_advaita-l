I humbly request you to please continue doing nitya karma and pray to God
to show you the way. Rest leave it to God. God will also correct your
approach if it needs correction. Only catch is you will have to keep 
moksha
as the only goal of life and be open to change.

Good luck with your spiritual journey.

Thanks for your kind advice.  Yes, it is HE who gives us everything!! Even 
to do the nitya karma, the required  shakti and appropriate shraddha is at 
the mercy of that Almighty...tvameva mAta chaptia tvameva...tvameva sarvaM
