Dear Sri Bhaskar ji,

This 'considering' is not possible since his past janma is not known either
to himself or for others. So, it would be impossible for anyone to ascribe
patitatvam to him.  It is only in the case of rare yogi-s who have
jAtismara siddhi one's earlier birth/s can be divined.

I don't think Shankara has said this since, as I said above, it is
impossible to know the past birth/ashrama and make a comparison with the
current one.

Yes, the mundakopanishat mantra 1.2.10: ...nAkasya pRShThe tE
sukRtE'nubhUtvA imam lokam hInataram vA vishanti -

//Such people go to Swarga after dropping the body and enjoy the result of
Punya Karma. One experiences great pleasure. Once the Punya gets over then
one comes back into this world* or sometimes even the lower world*. //

The kaThopanishad 2.2.7 mantra: ....yathAkarma yathAshrutam.. also gives
the same meaning as above: the jIva-s, after going to various loka-s for
bhoga, attain to any birth depending upon their mental make up and karma.

So, there is no guarantee that one will land in a human body alone, after
an earlier birth, even though human.  The YogabhraShTa verses of the BG
sixth chapter too have this rule/exception as the basis.  That is why it is
said: gahanA karmaNo gatiH - the ways of karma are inscrutable.
