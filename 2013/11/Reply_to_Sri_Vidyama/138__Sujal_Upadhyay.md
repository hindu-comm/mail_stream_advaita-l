Dear HSC ji,

By saying that sanYAsa is a mental state does not mean that external
renunciation is useless. One has to develop sanyAsa and retain it. A
sanyAsin is not the one who wears ochre coloured cloth.

By saying it is mental occupation, I was giving stress to mental state than
outward appearance. I was not denying it.

You tell me, of what use is ipad, iMAC and iPOD and all those i stuff have
to do with sanyAsa. What is the use of mobile? is it necessary? can you
survive without mobile? if yes, then drop it. Again, why you need iphone?
why not Rs 1000 phone acceptable.

If you argue, it is God's wish that I received in donation, then I would
humbly keep requesting a monk to take poison. :D

It is option to accept gift or donations. It is not compulsory.

Do you think that after 50 or 75 years all of the hindus took sanyAsa?
Please give reason behind your answer.

If by doing nitya karma your chitta is purified, then all should take
sanyasa at appropriate age. If they are not taking means nitya karma is not
giving chitta shudhia. Right? what is your opinion?

Again, one person takes sanyasa by performing same nitya karma, but for
very short period time. How is this possible? his this guy a thug?

What is important, action or mind (bhAva, intention) along with goal?

Is action jaDA or chetan?
is mind jaDA or chetan w.r.t to action?

What has to be given more importance? You suggest.

Hari OM
