Kindly see the Sankara Bhashya for Br Up 4-4-22 - Tametam
 Vedanuvacanena Brahmana Vividishanti Yajnena Danena Tapasa Anashakena. Adi
Sankara is saying Dravya Yajnaa Jnaana Yajnaasca Samskrutaarthaaha,
Samskrutasya Vishuddha Sattvasya Jnaanotpattir Apratibandhena Bhavishyati.
The Jnana will come automatically when the Mind is purified by Yajnas. He
does not have to do anything more.

After some more sentences he is saying again Evam Kaamyavarjitam Nityam
Karmajaatam Sarvam Atma Jnaanotpattidvaarena Moksha Saadhanatvam
Pratipadyate. All the Nitya Karma is a Moksha Saadhana by giving Atma
Jnaana. He is not saying you have to first do Nitya Karma then take
Sannyasa. Then you get Atma Jnaana. Then Moksha. No. The Karma will
directly give Atma Jnaana. How? Because it will remove the Obstacle for
Jnana. The Removing of Obstacles is done by Action only. Upanishad Vakyas
only will give Paroksha Jnana if the Obstacle is still there. But Karma
will give the Aparoksha Jnana by removing the obstacle.

For thousands of years people have not understood this Adi Sankara's
importance to Karma and they are arguing he was against rituals.

I think Adi Sankara has agreed with Mandana Mishra here. Both are saying
same thing.

It is common sense removing a coloured object from the colourless crystal
is Action only. It cannot be some other thing. The coloured object has to
be physically moved. Then only we can see the colourless crystal.
