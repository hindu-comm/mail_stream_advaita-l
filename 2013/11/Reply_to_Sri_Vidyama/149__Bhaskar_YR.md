The Vidhis and Nishedhas are for the body but not for Atma. The Atma 
cannot
have any rules and regulations. When Adi Sankara was in Sannyasi body he
was following Sannyasi rules and regulations. When he entered King
Amaraka's body in Para Kaya Pravesha he was following the Khastriya rules
and regulations and enjoying with his wives and learning Kama Sastra. 
There
is no Papa and no Prayascitta required for this.

I dont know what to say to the arguments like this!!  Infact this is what 
we have find as one of the justifications from bhagavatpAda when padmapAda 
asked the question on yati dharma before parakAya pravesha.  One point we 
are forgetting here is, in vyavahAra, we have the entity called jeeva 
which is not paramAtma and which would take many janma-s, it is this jeeva 
(parichinna chaitanya) that would suffer from the karma phala.  And 
according to this karma phala only he would get the body.  So, vidhi 
nishedha applicable to this jeeva who is entangled in the body.  If the 
pApa & puNya is for the body only, then a particular body has to suffer / 
enjoy the karma phala in that body only there will be no question of 
janmAntara  / lOkAntara karma phala.  It would be better to be noted that 
body is an inert (jada) thing it cannot do anything on its own.  Body 
needs internal karaNa-s and driving force i.e. called jeeva in vyavahAra. 
So, though kAya is para the 'karta' is same, in the above episode also, 
though the body is of the  kshatriya's, the karta in that kshatriya body 
in 'yati' and it is that 'yati' who enjoyed that rAja bhOga with stree-s 
in kshatriya's body.  So, in the SAME janma a yati should not do the 
nishedha karma in another body by using his yOgic power. 

Anyway, I donot want to continue this discussion on shankara's parakAya 
pravesha as described in mAdhaveeya & chidvilAseeya etc. My point in short 
is that katrutva, bhOktrutva belongs to jeeva which is sentient and we 
should not attribute it to mere body to take excuses from the nishedha 
karma. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
