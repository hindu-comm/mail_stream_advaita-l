Namaste

I am not saying in the message we should go to visit a Sanyasi empty
handed. We can take fruits and other things. Nowadays Swamijis are also
accepting cash. But nobody takes Samit to them. The days of Samit carrying
have ended by Adi Sankara. Samit is a symbol of Karma also not only
humility. Like that Darbha is a symbol of Karma because we have to wear
Pavitra made from Darbha in all Karma.
