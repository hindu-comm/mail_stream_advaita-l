praNAms
Hare Krishna

Here in BG, Bhagavan says all karmas, which includes Prarabhdha too.

> No, if my memory serves me right, actually here shankara excludes 
prArabdha and says only saNchita & AgAmi...you can check out the shankara 
bhAshya on this verse.  But in a prakaraNa grantha called apararOksha 
anubhUti, attributed to shankara, author  says there is not even prArabdha 
karma to the jnAni. 

If anything remains in mind, then mind is not destroyed. Hence everything
empties. Even Prarabhdha is burned by fire of knowledge.

>  not so, those who follow the sAmpradAyik works  say (quoting shankara's 
sUtra bhAshya) even paramArtha jnAni is subject to kAma, krOdha sometime 
due to this prArabdha karma phala.  It is better to know here there is 
diversified view points with regard to this among shankara's advaita 
followers.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
