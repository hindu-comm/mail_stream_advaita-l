There is said to be a 'novel' explanation to the 'samitpANiH'  believed to
be given by the Kanchi mahAperiyava:

'samyag itau pANI yasya saH samitpANiH'.  He whose palms have been well
joined (in the manner of namaskAra) is 'samitpANiH'.  [I have not checked
the sentence for grammar; I am only citing from memory  what I heard from
someone long ago.]
