Dear Sujal ji,

If Prarabda is not present, why would in Brahmasutra 4.1.13 it is
said-"When Knowledge is attained, there is destruction and nullification of
past and future Karmas".?

If Prarabda is not remaining, then a person who attains Jnana becomes
Videha-Mukta immediately. But, we see that so many Jivan-Muktas are present
for the welfare of the world. When a person attaining Jnana has
extinguished all Prarabda Karma( that were responsible for his present
body), then he would become "Videha Mukta" immediately. On the other hand,
if  a Jnani remains in the world as Jivan-Mukta, its because the Prarabda
Karmas responsible for the body is yet to completely extinguished.

But, I am not saying that Prarabda creates limitations in a Jnani. Instead
I am saying, that the body is maintained due to the Prarabda (Even
Ramakrishna is saying so in the above quote).

For a Jnani, all Avidya has been indeed destroyed, but the momentum caused
due to Avidya remains a little even after its destruction. This as I
understand, is variously called as Avidya Lesha or Prarabda. Because,
without that, then a Jnani living in his body is not possible. This was
what Ramakrishna meant by "Retaining connection with body/Ego etc"

I feel I am not at all contradicting you when you say, Jnani has no
limitations. Jnani is without Karma. That is what I have written in my
piece.

"The action by its very nature is due to Ignorance. An activity assumes a
subject, object and the action. But, a Jnani who has realized Brahman as
being beyond all activity, beyond all mutability, eternal, birth-less etc
How can such a Jnani perceive Birth, death and such mutations? How can such
person perceive the duality subject and object? How will such a person be
subjected to or bounded by Karma?"
