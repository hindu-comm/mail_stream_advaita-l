Namaste Sri Bhaskara

Kindly read Vedanta Prakriya Pratyabhijna by Holenarsipur Swami. In that
book he has given Mandana Mishra's Advaita Philosophy very clearly. Mandana
is saying meditation and Karma rituals have to be done for Moksha Prapti.
In ancient times before Adi Sankara also this type of Advaita was followed.
But Adi Sankara has banned all Karma for getting Moksha. We are following
Adi Sankara today.
