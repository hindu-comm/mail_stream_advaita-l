If the son was not married at the time of death, the father has to perform
Narayana Bali. There is no shrAddha to be done by the father for the son.
However, the father can offer tarpaNa to the son on the mahAlaya amAvAsya
day.

If the son was married at the time of death, and he did not have children,
the father may perform the shrAddha of the son on behalf of the
daughter-in-law.

This is what I have heard from scholars.

Anand
