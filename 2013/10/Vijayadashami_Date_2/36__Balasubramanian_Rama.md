There's a little bit more to the confusion. I know a number of temples in
North America which just use the same date as the Indian panchangam - which
is plainly wrong. Dashami is indeed on Oct 13th, since at sunrise
it happens to be dashamii on the 13th. Ditto with navamii. However due to a
peculiarity aShTamI does not come during sun-rise time at all (at least in
the Boston panchangam). But back calculating from Oct 13th puts prathama on
Friday Oct 4th, which however has amAvsyA during sun-rise. Since Oct 14th
has barely about 1.5 hours of dashamI, it seems reasonable to adopt Oct
13th as dashamI, which is what SVBF and the Ganesha temple in NY have
adopted. I am going with Oct 13th. In any case, there is more to the
confusion than just using the Indian panchangam.

I also strongly recommend mypanchang.com - it's an excellent resource.
