----------

I am a retired Official. I am an active member of Sri Ramakrishna Seva
Sangha, an associate organisation of Sri Ramakrishna Math,Mysore since 30
years. I am interested to update my knowledge about Advaita philosophy.

Namaste,

I am a practicing Advaitin. I am joining this group to learn more about our 
acharya, Advaita and Smarta SAmpradAya.

My Study in advaita is very limited. I believe in 'Read less and meditate 
more'.

I have been greatly influenced Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Ramana Maharshi.

Aum
