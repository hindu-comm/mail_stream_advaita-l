Anil Thakur
-----------

My name is Anil Thakur and am interested in understanding Advaita Vedanta
and its philosophy.

And, I am glad to join this e-satsangam and look forward to learn a lot.



Sree Prasanna Rambhatla
-----------------------

With the divine blessings of Shree Lalitamba, I Sree Venkata Prasanna Kumar , 
was initiated into SreeVidya by my guruji 3 years ago. Mother's unconditional 
love on this mere mortal has been amazing. Everyday I run into one or the 
other miracle which is nothing but mother's love. I wanted to join this group 
and draw from the nectar of advaita amrita from the other learned and wise 
souls of this group.

Shree Maathrey Namaha.
