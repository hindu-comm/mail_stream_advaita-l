It must be AbhAsa vAda. Refer to panchadashI 8.42 and up. I don't think he
calls it the AbhAsa-vAda (quick scan), but refers to the cidAbhAsa. The
unique thing about this is that the jahallakShaNA is used by Sri VidyAraNya
to interpret the mahAvAkya tat-tvam-asi instead of the usual
jahad-ajahal-lakShaNA.

Madhusudana Saraswati also advocates this view in the siddhAntabindu, but
prefers the jahad-ajahal-lakShaNA. It's a small variation of the
bimba-pratibimba-vAda. The differences between all these kinds of
"vAda"s are fairly minor. It's better to concentrate the message instead of
these kinds of packaging (just my opinion).

Rama
