Namaste

Dharma Jagrthi Trust ® is a service oriented organization working for
the perpetuation of Vedic traditions. Besides keeping alive the oral
tradition of Veda Mantras, this Trust has associated projects and
activities like promoting and guiding research in Vedic Sciences. It
has also plans to conduct Seminars, Workshops and Conferences on Veda
related themes. This conference is a humble attempt to bring together
the Vedic scholars, scientists, researchers together to rediscover and
protect the sovereignty and great cultural and scientific heritage of
our country. We need to pass on its message to our young and future
generations so that they will come out of the misconceptions such as
that our culture is superstitious, gullible, impoverished and
sadistic. Along with the above, to realize the practical down to earth
philosophy and advanced scientific perspective of our great culture it
is necessary to proclaim the Vedic Vision which establishes the
universal fact:  “vasudhaiva kutumbakam”.

With this vision, Dharma Jagrthi Trust®, Bengaluru, is presenting a
two day conference on Vedas to encourage the lay and the learned, the
young and the old enthusiasts of Vedas to share their knowledge and
enrich themselves.

Arsha Dhara 2013 is designed to hold five sessions totally with
exclusive sessions for women, youth, saints and media . In each
session, there would be presentations from scholars/ scientists/
researchers/youngsters with different kinds of Vedic chanting in
between, by the gurukula students. Panel discussions are also
included. Students would also be encouraged to present papers with a
vision to encourage research attitude in the field of Vedic studies.

The special attraction in Arsha Dhara 2013 is Bala Sammelanam, an
exclusive session for children between age groups 10 to 16 years where
kids would be encouraged to speak on subjects related to Vedas,
culture and ancient sciences of India. In this way, Dharma Jagrthi
Trust wishes to invoke research attitude since a younger age towards
their ancient treasures.

The expected outcome of the conference would be recorded and saved as
a treasure of  knowledge for the future generations.

We request you to make use of this opportunity to share your
knowledge/ enrich your knowledge.

Encourage the Arshadhara family to come up with more activities which
can be beneficial for mankind.
