Namaste,

gAyatri is the "chadas" (metrical notation) which has to satisfy certain conditions like 24 akSarAs. It should have a rishi (seer), dEvata, shakti, bija, keelaka.  

One cannot coin new gAyatris out of the blue for any dEvatAs.  

A wrong notion among certain purOhitAs is that if are able to coin the mantra containing "vidmahE", "dhImahI" and "prachOdayAt", it becomes a gAyatri mantra. 

NO.  This is not the shiSTAchAra.

regs,
sriram
