If one wanted 
to meditate on some other form, why not use their own Gayatri?  Every 
deity has one.

sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vyas prabhuji
Hare Krishna

But all gAyatri is not veda base...can we use different gAyatri for deity 
which does not have veda base??  For example, hanumAn gAyatri, skanda 
gAyatri, sarpa gAyatri ( nava nAga gAyatri) navagraha gAyatri ( for all 
the navagraha-s) etc. donot have reference in veda-s I think, unlike 
vishnu, shiva, nArasimha, durga, gaNapati, sUrya, shaNmukha, nandi etc. 
for which we have the veda reference in upanishads like mahAnArAyaNa. 
Kindly clarify.

I recently heard a latest gAyatri on circle mAramma ( a famous deity here 
in Malleshwaram circle, Bangalore), the priest who was performing 
'mAramma' hOma chanting 'circle mAramma' gAyatri maNtra in loud speaker 
while giving gudAnna  Ahuti, gAyatri was something like :  mahAkAlyaicha 
vidmahe, shiva patnaicha dheemani, tannO mAramma prachOdayAt.. :-)) 

can we use ready made gAyatri-s like this to propitiate the sthaLa devata 
or kshetra devata prabhuji ??   Kindly clarify.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
