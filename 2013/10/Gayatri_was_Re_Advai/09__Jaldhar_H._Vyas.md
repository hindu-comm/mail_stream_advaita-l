What is popularly know as Gayatri is Savitri, praise to Brahman in the 
form of Surya the "nourisher" (savitr) of life.  In my opinion if one is 
to meditate on a saguna form, that should be the one.  It is not so much 
that other forms are "wrong" but this one is "more right."  If one wanted 
to meditate on some other form, why not use their own Gayatri?  Every 
deity has one.
