A wrong notion among certain purOhitAs is that if are able to coin the 
mantra containing "vidmahE", "dhImahI" and "prachOdayAt", it becomes a 
gAyatri mantra. 

NO.  This is not the shiSTAchAra.

That is true...but there available a book called 'vividha devatA gAyatri 
maNtra saMgraha :_)) which has gAyatri maNtra for more than 100 devata-s 
including gaNga, kaveri, kaateramma, kambAlamma, karumAriyamma, 
veerabhadra, yaksha etc. and each devata has two or three different 
gAyatri maNtra-s....As you know, there are more than 28 types of 
sudarshana gAyatri:-))  It is very difficult to find out which is the 
genuine veda based gAyatri and which are the fabricated gAyatri maNtra-s 
:-))

prabhuji, by any chance, do you have the list of gAyatri maNtra-s which 
has the vedik reference??  If yes, kindly send it to me off the list in a 
PDF / word format. 


Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
