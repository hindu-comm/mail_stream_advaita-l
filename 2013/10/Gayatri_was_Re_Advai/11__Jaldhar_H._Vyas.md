Well some are also found in tantras and agamas but you are specifically 
speaking of the "modern" ones I presume.

Historically many of these deities were worshipped by the lower strata of 
society who are now coming up in the world.  When the bhakta has a Gucci 
handbag, and ipad and fancy house and car, the devata must also be 
properly equipped.  It will not do for uptodate people to worship in the 
same way as illiterate country grandmothers!  To such people I would ask 
for a moment of contemplation.  Is what they are doing really from a 
sattvika bhakti bhava where one acts purely out of love for ones ishta 
without expectations or is it a rajasika sense of self-aggrandizement? 
Those country grandmothers might not have known a gayatri from a ghazal 
but did Maramma accept their devotion any less?  In the end isn't that 
what truly matters?
