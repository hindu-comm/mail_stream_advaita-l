Namaste,

This site has helped me a lot to understand Advaita. It is a valuable
resource.

I have been reading Sri Rudram with SAyanAchArya's bhASya translated by Sri
Anand Hudli-ji

http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/series/shri_rudram/shri_rudram_top.htm

Anu vAkya-s 1, 2 and 10 are available. Is the entire translation of Sri
Rudram in light of sAyanAchArya's bhASya available.

Please can you give the link for the same.

Aum

Thanks and Regards

Sujal Upadhyay
