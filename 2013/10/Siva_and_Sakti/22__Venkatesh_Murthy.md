Namaste

Males have Siva Amsha in them and females have Sakti Amsha.

In one episode of Mahadev TV serial Siva has said women will get more
favours easily from him than men. Ladies generally worship him on Mondays.
Why this? Because women have Sakti Amsha in them. When the woman worships
Siva there will be union of Siva and Sakti.

Like this Sakti worship by men produces more benefits. Because a man has
Siva Amsha. When he worships Sakti it will produce a union of Siva and
Sakti.

Scholarly members can kindly give references if this is explained in any
sources like Puranas and Tantras.

In Saundarya Lahari also Adi Sankara is praying like a child of the Mother.
In  life also we can see a father has more affection for daughter and
mother has more affection for the son. Father loves son also but he has
special affection to daughter. Mother loves daughter also but special love
for son.
