Nice job.  The message of this stotra ties in with what Sadanandaji 
recently wrote about nidhidhyasana.  We praise the Guru because it is from 
the Guru that we hear and understand the shastras (shravana) With a lesser 
amount of  help from the Guru and in debate and discussion with other 
people both fellow sadhakas and opponents we can contemplate the meaning 
and implications of what we have learnt. (manana)  But the third stage of 
nidhidhasana is one which must be practised alone.  It involves the 
systematic dismantling of all previous concepts and notions and this is 
wonderfully brought out by Shankaracharya in the nirvanashatakam.
