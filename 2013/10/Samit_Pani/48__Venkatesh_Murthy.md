Namaste

In Prashna Upanisad the Brahma Jnaninaha like Bharadwaja'son Sukesha,
Satyakama, Sauryayani, Ashvalayana Kausalya, Bhargava and Katyayana
Kabandhi  the six Brahma Nishthas approached the Guru Pipplada with Samit
sticks in hands.

In Upanisads the disciple will approach his Guru with fuel sticks in hand.
Why? He will give the fuel sticks to the Guru. The Guru is not be a
Sanyasi. He may perform many Yajnas and he is teaching Brahma Jnana to
disciples. Sanyasis cannot perform Yajnas and fire rituals like this.

But this is going against Adi Sankara's argument Brahma Jnana will happen
after giving up Karma Kanda.

Kindly clear this doubt.
