Namaste,
 Jnanagnihi cannot burn the Ardhrachethas (Mind wet due to Karma bandha)but will burn quicklywith shuddha viragaha (vairagya shushkam). .............shloka 40 of Shathashloki by Sri. Shankara Bhagawadpada.

It shows the readiness of the student for Brahma vidya with immense vairagya who approaches the Guru with folded hands as a sign of humility.

The Guru is going to see his physical appearance at first with his eyes. The student for his part shows his humility with his folded palms followed by submission of dried sticks indicative of hisvairagya and falling like Dhanda at His Lotus Feet indicative of complete surrender.

regards,
smt.sumitha

Dear Sriram ji,

In the Anandagiri gloss for the bhashya on the said Mundaka mantra 1.2.12,
it is said: 'samitpANiH iti vinayopalakShaNam.' [The expression
'samitpANiH' is a representative indication for the humility of the
aspirant approaching the Guru]. The editor Sri Subrahmanya Sastri in the
foot note says:

// By the word 'brahmaniShTha' the BhashyakAra indicates that he is a
sannyAsin. Then, what is the use of going to such a one with samit which
is of no use to him? In order to answer this Anandagiri says that it is an
upalakShaNa, representative indication, to the aspirant's vinaya,
humility. SamitpANitvam on the part of the aspirant will be directly
appropriate in the case of those householder-brahmaniShTha-s such as
Janaka, yAjnavalkya and angiras. //

One another explanation I have heard is: the samit, dried sticks, are
indicative of the sishya's readiness to subject himself to the rigours of
brahmavidyA and receive it successfully just as dried sticks will
immediately burn when put in fire.
