Dears
I think the thread has digressed too far.The question was about Brahmajnanam and whether Sri Sankara 's saying that Karma kanda has to be given up and if so why students seeking Brahmajnanam should approach with samith a guru who is a brahma jnani and the fuel sticks denote Karma.R.Krishnamoorthy.

That is the one of the reason why in the ancient times the girls were not sent to gurukul and the vidya was inparted by father to daughter as Kanvamuni did that to Shakuntala. That is because of the custom followed by many gurus is that the guru must see the disciple in full body. In ancient times the husband also could give vidya to wife as Yajnavalkya taught his wife, so much so that she could stand upto her husband in a debate among scholars. There is a Sanksrit verse (which I read in many years ago and I do not recollect the details now), which says that a female should chose a female guru and male should choose a male guru. There have been many problems in the past as wel as in the recent times when this dictum was ignored.
