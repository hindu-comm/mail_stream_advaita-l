Namaste,

Our dharma says that one should never approach elders (guru & acharya) empty-handed.

Having submitted the appropriate sambhAvana to the Acharya either in the form of phala, dhana, vastu etc., one should seek their blessings which is called "AsheevAdaM".  This is maNgaLa-sUchaka.  

So, "samidhAs" represent the vaidika-karma (pUrva-meemAmsa).  He intends to say that so far he has performed all these karma-kANDa to his satisfaction and now he is interested in jnAna-mArga and wants to spend his life in Atma-vichAra.

Hence, he approaches the AchArya with humility having samidhAs in his hand to seek the AchArya-deekSa by initiating him in sanyAsa thereby wants to relieve himself from the karma-mArga.  The samidhAs, thus presented by the shishya is used for "virajA-hOma" by the Acharya. 

regs,
sriram
