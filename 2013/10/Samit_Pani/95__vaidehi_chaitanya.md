Namasthe

the samit is a symbol of the readiness of the student who approaches the
guru  that "s/he is ready to burn the ego". the samit by its very nature
catches the fire immediately (in upanishad - the fire refers to the fire of
knowledge *Ijnanagni) *and weightless (*here weightlessness refers to ego
which is tired and has given up itself to a considerable degree. it does
not want to burden itself any more become heavy engaging in the activities
of the world). *
*
*
*so, in upanishad, the lakshyaartha is very important to probe into than
the vkyartha. vakhyartha is the one which says about yagna and yaga for
which samit is to be used. *

*hari om and gurubhyo namah*
