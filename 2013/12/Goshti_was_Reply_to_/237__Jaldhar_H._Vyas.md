An older post I had been meaning to reply to.

I do not think that the shloka is trying to criticize goshti in the sense 
of satsanga.  What is the brahamsutra except a meeting of the views of 
different acharyas, some of which are accepted and some rejected?  Rather 
it is listing distractions which prevent single-minded focus.  Goshti is 
bad only in the sense that one cannot achieve jnana by comittee.  If one 
is relying on anything other than viveka then it is only time-passing. 
But if one seeks other views out in an effort to understand that is 
eminently practical.

As for Internet forums, while I feel justified in being proud of what 
advaita-l has achieved I will be the first to say it is only an aid to 
sadhana not a replacement for proper, rigorous sadhana.
