Otherwise, what is the difference between some vaishnava attacking the 
great tradition of advaita and advaitin attacking others? 
//////////

I believe you are initiated in the mantra under the lineage of gaudiya siddhAnta. 

The first and foremost thing you should learn :

1) vAdOnAvalambyaH

One must not indulge in arguments like vAda, prativAda, jalpa, vitaNDa etc.  This is not good for one's sAdhana.

2) bAlyAvakAshAdani yatatvAccha 

If one engages in an argument, the discussions triggers off several points in the form of pUrva-pakSa. To counter those pUrva-pakSins, one has to again resort to several arguments.  This becomes a vicious circle.  Moreover, the vAdana is a-nishchita ie., if one is not in a position to defend himself in the arguments, he might lose faith in AchArya and dEvata bhakti.  

The above sUtrAs are taken from nArada bhakti sUtrAs.  

Spend time in upAsana and hari sankeertana. Never leave your sandhyAvandana anuSTAna and kriSNa bhakti.  

regs,
sriram
