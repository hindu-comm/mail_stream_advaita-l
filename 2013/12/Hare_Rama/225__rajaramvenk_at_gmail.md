I don't know what you mean the order doesn't matter. No one, advaitin or otherwise, should change the mantras in the upanishad. it would be whimsical. Like I said there are three textual references (two versions of the kali santarana manuscript and radha tantra). We should critically evaluate the texts.

For this mantra, there is no regulation whatsoever as per the upanishad.  Does any one know what are the 16 kalas of the jIvA talked of in the upanishad please?

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Hare Rama

Advaitis dont care Hare Rama is first or Hare Krishna is first. All 
Mantras
are useful if they are coming from Authentic Source. All Mantras are good.
You can say Hare Rama first or Hare Krishna first but benefit will be 
same.
If you say Om Namaha Shivaaya also benefit is same. Vishnu and Shiva are
same. Mantras have to be given to you by Guru. If you simply say a mantra
35 million times without Guru Upadesha it will have no effect.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Yes, hence we follow the panchAyatana pUja paddhati in tradition.  shivAya 
vishNu rUpAya, shiva rUpAya vishNave, shivascha hrudayaM 
vishNu..vishNoscha hrudayaM shiva..evaM vishNumaya shiva..etc. Ultimately 
what needs to be realized is nirguNa, nirvishesha, nirAkAra, nirAmaya 
parishuddha brahma tattva which is nAma rUpAteeta.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
