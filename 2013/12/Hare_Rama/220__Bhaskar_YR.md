I think we should learn our traditions before commenting on them in a 
casual manner as each tradition has gems. 

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Yes, I agree, ISKCON is doing a great service in propagating bhakti 
mArga..but not a good place to learn advaita.  Order change is because, 
they (ISKCON) consider krishna is pUrNAvatAra other avatAra-s  are kevala 
'amsha' (even vishNu also for that matter) of the supreme godhead Lord 
Krishna. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!
bhaskar
