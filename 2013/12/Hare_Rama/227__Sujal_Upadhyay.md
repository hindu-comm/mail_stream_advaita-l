It is said by ISKONites or Gaudiyas (dont know exactly) that Ramanandani-s
changed the order fro mhare krishna to hare rama

AS per beej mantra-s, the order is important from vedanga-s POV, as it
produces specific vibrations and activates nadi-s. Words also spread far
when chanted loudly (but correctly) and purity atmosphere and all present,
including animals, says Kanchi Paramacharya.

But for PurAnic Mantra-s bhAva is the factor that is considered prime, not
that beej mantra-s require no bhAva, but they have been devised and coined
by great Rishi-s after much experimentation and RTD, so that they directly
touch the heart (source). If you take this into account, then words, their
pronunciation and their order is also important, whereas if you consider
only bhava like Sri Rama, Jai Rama, Jai Jai Rama, then only bhAva is
considered important.

Sriram Sharma has done some research about effectiveness of Gayatri Mantra
on our body. i do not have much info about it.
