Advaitis dont care Hare Rama is first or Hare Krishna is first. All 
Mantras
are useful if they are coming from Authentic Source. All Mantras are good.
You can say Hare Rama first or Hare Krishna first but benefit will be 
same.
If you say Om Namaha Shivaaya also benefit is same. Vishnu and Shiva are
same. Mantras have to be given to you by Guru. If you simply say a mantra
35 million times without Guru Upadesha it will have no effect.

Hare Krishna

Yes, hence we follow the panchAyatana pUja paddhati in tradition.  shivAya 
vishNu rUpAya, shiva rUpAya vishNave, shivascha hrudayaM 
vishNu..vishNoscha hrudayaM shiva..evaM vishNumaya shiva..etc. Ultimately 
what needs to be realized is nirguNa, nirvishesha, nirAkAra, nirAmaya 
parishuddha brahma tattva which is nAma rUpAteeta.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
