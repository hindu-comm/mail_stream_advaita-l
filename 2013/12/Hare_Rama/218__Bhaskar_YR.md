1. What is the version of the mantra there? 

praNAms Hare Krishna

As per my knowledge hare rAma comes first followed by hare Krishna in 
kalishAntaraNa Up....But in ISKCON chanting starts with Hare Krishna. 
Perhaps to prove the supremacy of Krishna they might have opted this 
order..

Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
