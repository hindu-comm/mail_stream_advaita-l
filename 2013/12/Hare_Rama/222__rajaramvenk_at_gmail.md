There are two versions of the kali santarana upanishad manuscript extant today. The oldest has hare krishna version. However, the older tradition in guruvayoor has hare rama version. Can you please let me know your thoughts what advaitins accept as authentic?

hare kR^iShNa hare kR^iShNa kR^iShNa kR^iShNa hare hare ||
