I don't know what you mean the order doesn't matter. No one, advaitin or 
otherwise, should change the mantras in the upanishad. 

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

It may be noted that we are not  talking about the change in the order of 
original up. maNtra, we are talking about the dogmatic approach in 
preferring krishna to rAma and deliberately chanting Hare krishna first to 
prove the supremacy of krishna over all (demi) gods :-)) Anyway, an 
advaitin, if at all he wants to chant hare krishna (rAma) maNtra, he would 
do so as per the instruction of his deekshA guru without bothering much 
about difference between rAma and krishna :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
