Thanks. I thought so because Hare Rama version is what's there in the living tradition of guruvayoor, which is older than any extant manuscript. It is also the version that Sri Muralidhara Swamigal teaches. I don't agree that advaitins ignored it as the only commentary is by an advaitin and its part of a living tradition. 

Does he say what are the 16 kalas surrounding the jIvA removing which its parabrahma svarupam shines forth as per the upanishad??

Truth be told Advaitins for the most part ignored it.  Upanishad 
Brahmayogi is the only major figure who saw fit to comment on it and the 
version I quoted is the one embedded in the text he was commenting on.

See Prashnopanishad 6.
