Vedanta means that which is at the end of the vedas.This part lies at the finishing portion of the Vedas.This is called "Upanishad".Upa means "additional" nishad means"that which is Kept".What is "Unreal"?That which doesnot answer to any validity of the "Pramanas".What is "Real"-that which answers to the validity of the Pramanas.To know the "truth"-Sastra is a "Pramana".Real must have necessarily "Self validity".Unreal has no validity.
N.Srikanta
