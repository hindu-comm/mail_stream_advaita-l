I've been to that area.  In puranas it is known as vastrapatha kShetra and 
its mahatmya is in the Skanda Purana.  There are many ancient tirths and 
historical monuments (such as shilalekhas of Ashoka, Skandagupta, 
Rudradaman of the kshatrapa dynasty etc.)  You are right that many 
sannyasis are found there.  Some are residents others are parivrajakas 
(wanderers) for whom this is a regular stop on a great pradakshina of 
Bharat.  From Mt. Abu (Arbudachala) they proceed through there on the way 
to Dwaraka/Somanath.
