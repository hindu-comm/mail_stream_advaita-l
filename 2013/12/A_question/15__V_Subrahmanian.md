The verse is the third one from the 'viShNu-ShaTpadI-stotram' of
Shankaracharya, which starts with 'avinayam apanaya viShNo..' ['O ViShNu,
free me of arrogance...'] .

The difference is admitted by Shankara from the vyAvahArika point of view.

The dependence of the jIva on Ishwara for everything including the

favourite of many non-advaitins too.
