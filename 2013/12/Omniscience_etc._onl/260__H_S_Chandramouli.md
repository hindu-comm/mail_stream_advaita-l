H S CHANDRAMOULI

Dear Sri Subrahmanianji/ Sri Bhaskarji,

I must confess i am a bit confused about the nature of disagreement here.
Sri Sji has written

<Actually only with  sarvajnatvaM, sarvashaktitvaM etc. Brahman (nirguNa.
Turiya) is called Ishwara (saguNa, sixth mantra of mAnDUkya - ESha
sarvajnaH...antaryAmi...).  That is the way Advaita distinguishes Brahman
from Ishwara.>

Brahman and Iswara are two different levels of reality. This very important
aspect is not broughtout in the above statement which almost leads one to
conclude that the two are of the same level of reality. In my opinion this
is what Sri Bji also has mentioned ( correctly in my view ). Vivarta
principle starts right here. Hence sarvajnatva etc are all in the sphere of
avidya only.

Sri Sji also makes the following statement.

 <Now, the 'everything', in other words, the entire creation, jagat, is
'existing' ONLY on the 'sat', existence, of the Sat, Brahman.  Thus the
world enjoys only a dependent existence, paratantra sattaa, and never an
independent existence, swatantra sattaa.  The ONLY example for such a
phenomenon is the rope-snake.>

This also i think is misleading. For example vedanta itself advances the
argument that pot exists only because of the clay. In fact all cause and
effect reasoning ( effect is not different from cause ) on which vedanta
places emphasis is about dependent existence only. But this is not  vivarta
which the rope snake example is. In advaita sidhanta, Brahman to Iswara is
vivarta , and all creation from Iswara downwards is considered as parinama
conforming to cause and effect reasoning. Since the first cause Iswara is
vivarta in Brahman all else following that is automatically vivarta in
Brahman.

I am really not clear about what Sri Sji wanted to convey. From whatever i
understood i thought some clarity is called for. Hopefully i have
contributed towards that end. This should also clarify all the other points
mentioned by Sri Bji.

Incidentally i might add here a slightly different meaning given to the
word " sarvajnam " in Mandukya karika verse 3-36 Bhashyam. The Bhashyam
states quote < ata eva sarvam cha tat jna svarupam cha iti sarvajnam >
unquote. ( Because it is everything as well as of the nature of Chaitanyam
( chaitanya svarupam ) it is sarvajnam ).

Regards
