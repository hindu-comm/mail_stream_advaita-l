Namaste,

Sorry for the typos. Kindly permit me to send the corrected mail as below:

Probably only with the help of
 science a modern man may somewhat be able to grasp this better. Ishvara, 
who is Apara-Brahman and whose Vachaka is "OM" is in a 
divisible-indivisible (i.e., distinguishable-indistinguishable) state 
with Para-Brahman, whose Vachaka too is "OM". In Thermodynamics this is a
 reversible situation. To my mind it is better to leave it at that 
rather than defining Ishvara as with paratantra or Vyavaharika existence 
alone. Remembering what Yajnavalkya said, may be our heads will fall off
 if we want to probe further into this

Regards,
Sunil KB

The Vedantic satkAryavAda is different from the sAnkhya satkAryavAda:

The effect, prior to manifesting , exists in the cause, AS the cause
itself - This is
 vedAnta.

The effect, prior to manifesting , exists in the cause, AS the effect
itself - This is sAnkhya.

It is only because of this crucial difference we are able to have vivarta
vAda while for the sAnkhya the effect is absolutely real. For the vedantin
the effect is only an appearance of the cause itself.
