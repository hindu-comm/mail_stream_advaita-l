The Vedantic satkAryavAda is different from the sAnkhya satkAryavAda:

The effect, prior to manifesting , exists in the cause, AS the cause
itself  - This is vedAnta.

The effect, prior to manifesting , exists in the cause, AS the effect
itself  - This is sAnkhya.

It is only because of this crucial difference we are able to have vivarta
vAda while for the sAnkhya the effect is absolutely real.  For the vedantin
the effect is only an appearance of the cause itself.
