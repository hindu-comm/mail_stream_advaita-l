Namaste.

There is absolutely no doubt that the Upanishads declare Brahman alone is
Satyam . I have not disputed this. I was mentioning about one of the
techniques ( prakriya ) adopted by the Upanishads to drive home this point.
In this prakriya the Upanishads do ascribe reality to this creation to
begin with and followsup with reducing the variety in creation by tracing
them to their karana. For example all things to sthula bhutas, then to
sukshma bhutas followed by individual bhutas etc. It is during this process
that it adopts the principle that karya ( effect ) is not different from
its karana ( cause ) .
