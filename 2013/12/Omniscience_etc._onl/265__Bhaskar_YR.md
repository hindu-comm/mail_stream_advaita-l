It is during this process
that it adopts the principle that karya ( effect ) is not different from
its karana ( cause ) .

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Yes, shankara discusses this exclusively in ArambhaNAdhikaraNaM.  The 
cause cannot create altogether a new effect if the effect is not existing 
in cause already.  kArya-kAraNa ananyatva and shakti in kAraNa which 
produce kArya is non-different from kAraNa.  In geeta bhAshya (guNa traya 
vibhAga yOga - 14th chapter??) also we find support for this I think, 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
