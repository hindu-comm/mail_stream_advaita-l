Namaste,

Those who are suffering from unmAda / unmatta-sthti, there is no samskAra-paddhati prescribed like upanayana etc. 

However, the parents / guardians can take the responsibility of giving proper dAnAs to the purOhita. There is an "unmAda-chikitsA-vidhi" prescribed where the parents / guardians can perform this on behalf of the person who is suffering from unmAda dosha.  

Lord Hanuman Ji is worshiped for removal of buddhi-jaDatva, manda-buddhi, unmAda-dosha etc.  Anjaneya bestows kushAgra-buddhi, vAk-chAturya, buddhi-balaM, dhairyaM etc.  

The below sloka details out the unmAda-chikitsA vidhi:

unmAda dOSa shAntyarthaM hanumacchintanaM paTEt
ashOkavanikA yAna samayE samupasthitaM
nivEdyataH prAtaH mASachUrNamAdrutaH

The person desirous of curing the unmAda dOSa, should get up early in the morning. After performing his nitya karma, should chant the 13th sarga of sundarakanda with devotion having his mind fixed on Hanuman.  After a formal puja to Hanuman, the naivedya offered should is mAshAnna (black gram). The mAshAnna should be pulverized.  The pulverized mAshAnna should be cooked alongwith rice. 
Such a rice should be given to the person who is suffering from this dosha.  This process should be continued till the disease gets cured.  

Also, the elders of the family like parents / grandparents should be asked to perform these:

1. Regular worship of one's kula-dEvata
2. Meticulous performance of shrAddha rituals like pitru-tarpaNAs, amAvAsya tarpaNAs etc.

These should be done after careful observation of horoscope because much depends upon the prArabdha-phala-bhOga. 

If prArabdha is strong, even maNi-mantra-aushadhi also wouldn't work.

regs,
sriram
