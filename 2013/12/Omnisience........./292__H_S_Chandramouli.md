Namaste. The difference is this. In snake rope the two are of different
levels of reality. While rope is real ( vyavaharika ) snake is unreal (
pratibhasika ). In clay pot, reality level of the two are the same, not
different. clay is unmanifest while pot is manifest. That is all. Karana is
always the unmanifest upadana while karya is always the manifest.
unmanifest and manifest are not two different levels of reality. Both are
vyavaharika level of reality only. Pot is a transactable effect while the
snake is not. Pot is a vikara of clay no doubt but not vivarta in clay.
Both are of course vivarta in Brahman. When the Chandogya you have quoted
mentions clay as the truth and pot as anrutha, it is definitely not in the
ultimate sense of Reality. Can we say clay is as real as Brahman? It is
only for the limited purpose of establishing the upadana karana only.
Shruti intends to show the entire creation as vivarta in Brahman. However
instead of considering each and every item of creation with reference to
Brahman, it first reduces the number of independent variables which go to
form creation to the minimum and then show them as vivarta in Brahman. This
is much akin to say the atomic theory of modern science. It shows all
elements as formed of only three variables namely protons, neutrons and
electrons. It has reduced the entire variety of materials to just three
independent variables. It has its own advantages. But this does not mean
that there are the only three real elements in creation. Same way with the
karya-karana technique . Its main advantage lies in the fact that the
entire creation is finally reduced to only a few which then are shown to be
vivarta in Brahman. With this the whole of creation stands proved to be
vivarta in Brahman. But as far as creation itself is concerned all the
karyas as well as karanas are of same level of reality.
