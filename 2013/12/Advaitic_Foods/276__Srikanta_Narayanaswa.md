Advaitic foods are basically sattvik.A food that is rajasic will only kindle desire.This has been said by Sri.Krishna in the Bhagawad Gita in the chapter on "Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga".The Tantra rituals as said by Sri.Sunil Bhattacharya is based on "Vamachara"tantra,whose sole aim is gratification of the senses.There is no consummation.Even in Yagnas whose sole aim to fulfil a desire like gaining the "svarga loka" etc.involves animal sacrifice(it is said the animal which is sacrificed reaches "svarga"as it is for the purpose of a Yagna".Sri.Krishna in the B.G further says that these karmas are endless and are cumulative.They are sinful and leads to endless births and deaths.
