(sanchita) Karma can be destroyed only by Jnana.  JnAnAgniH sarvakarmANi
bhasmasAtkurute. (BG).  And prArabdha will end only by experiencing -
upabhoga.  So, there is no such thing as 'karma is reducing' except in the
case of the jIvanmukta in whose case alone it can be said that the
prArabdha karma has ended with the fall of the body.  sAdhana can never
eliminate karma; only jnAna will.
