To add to the above,

I think there is a verse in Gita which says, Jnani also 'behaves' like
ajnani and outwardly it looks like he is been affected, but in reality he
is not affected. then there are some verses like - seeing action in
inaction (of ajnani) and seeing inaction in action (of Jnani) ...

Ajnani cannot know Jnani - This is said in some upanishad, cant recall, but
it goes like if an elephant dies from rabbit's horn, then this world is
true ... (or may be I heard in a Gita discourse)

If this is true, then why think of Jnani and associate his deeds, then why
not accept him and think it is Ishvara's lIlA, all for good of us.

nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
