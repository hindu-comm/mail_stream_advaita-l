HS CHANDRAMOULI

Dear Sri Venkatesha Murthyji,

I don't think a Jnani ever says he is a jnani. Nowhere is it said that a
jnani knows he has conquered himself. there is nothing to conquer. Mandukya
Karika has an excellent verse on this " state"  which says that there is no
bandha/moksha,sadhaka/sadhana,guru/shishya,papa/punya,etc in "state".I am
not able to give a reference to the verse as I am out of town and do not
have access to the book. On what is meant by manonasha and vasanakshaya I
have sent a separate mail in answer to another query.

Regards
