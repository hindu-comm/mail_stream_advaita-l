Dear Shri Chandramouli, why three conditions should be satisfied? If ajnana is removed, then he is a mukta. The very fact he lives on makes him a jivan mukta. Isn't this alone enough? For the mind to relish brahma jnanam, however, we need mano-nasa and vasana-kshaya. My understanding of mano-nasa is that when I see a pot, I see it for what it really is - all blissful brahman non-different my self -  instead of letting the mind undergo modification in the form of the pot or in other words I don't see it. My understanding of vasana kshaya is I'm  clear of impressions from past experiences of the pot and there's no internal absorption in the pot. These two are dependent on control of the mind not the rise of knowledge itself. Is it not?

Dear Shri Nitin, the bad qualities will be gone even when one has perfected naishkamya karma. He is simply interested in executing his svadharma. It will also be gone when one perform bhakti as his activities are done only for the Lord. The rise of jnana is not dependent on perfection in karma or bhakti though they help to make the mind pure. It is simply dependent on the instruction of maha vakyas and its absorption. Is it not? It may still leave the mind functional with its good and bad qualities if it was not controlled. Is it not?

I agree with Venkatesh Murthy. Even Sureshwaracharya in his Naishkarmya
Siddhi clearly says a Jivanmukta is devoid of desires, anger etc
