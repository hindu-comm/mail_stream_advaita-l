​It can arise in a person who knows mahAvAkya and understands it's meaning.
Whether it stays and stabilizes or not, is what controlled by shuddhi of
chitta.
There are specific rAga, etc. which are opposed to GYAna and there are
others, as desire of veg diet, hating veda-nindaka-s, etc. which are not
opposed to it. So, even with specific ashuddhi-s of specific intensity, one
can have GYAna.​
