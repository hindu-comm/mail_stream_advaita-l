Dear Sri Venkatesh,

There is no disagreement by Shankara with any scripture or the JMV with any
scripture.  The JMV is pointing to a fact, vastu sthiti, in Yajnavalkya's
case which none can deny.  In the Taittiriya Upanishad shIkShaavalli we
have:

yAni asmAkam sucharitAni tAni sevitavyAni, no itarANi, tAni tvayopAsyAni,
no itarANi  [The Guru instructs the shishya: Whatever is noble/good conduct
in me , that you have to imbibe/follow/imitate and not others (that which
is not good/noble in me).  That shows that it is possible that there are
some habits/mannerisms/conduct that is admitted/recognized by the Acharya
himself which is not to be imbibed by the shishya.  Pl. read what Shankara
says in that bhashyam Tai.up.1.11.  'Even if shiShTa-s do something that is
censurable...which is against the Veda.....'  These are the things that
Shankara explains there.

In the shAntipATha for 'mA viviShAvahaiH' Shankara says: due to
inadvertence there can be aparaadha, dveSha etc. between the shishya and
the Acharya.  It is well known that Shankara has said (and Sureshwara too):
'sunipuNAnAmapi sUkShmAparaadhadarshanAt'  [even with extremely careful
(adepts) persons mistakes occur].

One might argue that the teacher of the Veda here is not a brahmavit.
Shankara says somewhere 'Acharyasya kRtArthatvAt ...since the Acharya is
kRtArtha, has attained the ultimate,...

As I said earlier, the Upanishads/Gita always give the most ideal
situation.  But the vastu sthiti can be different; it would be impossible
or at least very rare to find a perfect Acharya and shiShya that conform
hundred percent to the scriptural requirement.  The play of prArabdha is
what comes to be highlighted in all such cases where anger, desire, etc.
manifest in Jnanis.  The JMV explicitly says this while comparing the two
types of adhikArin-s who take up brahmavidyA.  Pl. go through those
sections from the archives.  The search word can be: kRtopAsti and
akRtopAsti.
