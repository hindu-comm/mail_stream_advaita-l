But Jnana is opposed to Ajnana and Tatkaarya also. Ajnana is the Mula
Avidya. The Jagat, Manas, and desires also are Kaarya of Mula Ajnana. WHEN
the Mula Avidya is removed by Jnana there is no Kaarya also. If you know
Sukti Rajata is false will you have desire to get silver and become rich
and build houses? When you know rope is not snake will you have fear in
approaching it? When you Know the mirage water is false will you have
desire to drink it? Thirst may be there but it is natural body function.
Not desire. Desire is because of Ajnana.
