Namaste

The Jivanmukti being described by some members in this Advaita group is
against Krishna's teachings in the Gita.

In the fifth chapter shlokas below Krishna  has very clearly given the
picture of Jivanmukta. He must have controlled anger and desire. He is
yukta and sukhee. He is Jivanmukta. He goes to Brahma Nirvana. He becomes
liberated. But members here are saying the Jivanmukta can have desires and
anger and greed and other bad qualities. We can conveniently say they are
all Prarabdha and he can enjoy Jivanmukti. This is not correct.
