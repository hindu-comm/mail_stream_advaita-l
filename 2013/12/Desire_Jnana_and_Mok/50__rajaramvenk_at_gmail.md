Dear Shri Chandramouli, 

You do not need a paurusheya or apaurusheya text to tell you about your Self. You know you exist. You may conclude that your body was born and will die at some time due to inference and others telling you that. You may conclude that your Self was born and will die with the body. You cannot have direct experience of negating your self. Is it not?

Best Regards

H S CHANDRAMOULI

Dear Sri Subramanyamji,

This is regarding the last para of your mail wherein you mention that
Shruti is not only pramana for realizing the Truth. I am sorry to differ.
It could send out a wrong message. Hence this mail. It has been stressed
repeatedly that shrutis are the ONLY pramanas for this purpose.They are not
the works of human beings ( Apaurusheya ) while yuktis can be so.  When it
is said that for attaining jnana recourse has to be made to shruti,yukti
and anubhava, it is always mentioned that yukti and anubhava have to be
understood consistent with what is stated is the shrutis. In other words
what is concluded in the shrutis have to be taken as the Data while the
yuktis to be adopted have to lead to this Data as conclusion.

Regards
