​See, we are giving explanations under fixed boundaries. We have to accept
*veda*-s as *pramANa*, we have to accept what is available through
*pratyaxa*, etc. , and we have to avoid their clashes too.
So, in present scenario we have this explanation which fits every criteria.
In this way, this is one of the best explanations.

​Actually, whenever people express their own understanding instead of mere
objecting other's views, there are more chances that we could examine their
understanding and reveal differece of views.
You did the same here. So, here I'm doing the same.

*avidyA-lesha *is not 'small quantity of *avidyA*' - is to be understood
firstly.
Questions you posed later in your post are based on this false assumption.
So, just removing this assumption will help you.
See, according to *saMpradAya avidyA-lesha* is :

*AvaraNavixepashaktimatyA mUlAvidyAyA
prArabdhakarma-vartamAnadehA-dyanuvR^itiprayojako vixepashaktyaMshaH.*​

*mUlA avidyA* has two *shakti*-s : *AvaraNa-shakti* and *vixepa-shakti*.
*GYAna *destroys *AvaraNa-shakti* part of *mUlAvidyA*, because only then
the realization of oneness 'I'm brahman' can be supported.
But, as *jIvanmukta*-s, i.e. '*GYAnI*-s with body, etc.'(which are effects
of *avidyA*) are seen in world and supported by scriptures. So, it is
accepted that *vixepa-shakti *of *avidyA *is not totally eradicated.
This *vixepa-shakti
part *of *avidyA *which continues after *GYAna *to support existence of
*prArabdha-karma*, present-body, etc. ; is known as *avidyA-lesha*.

As it is accepted only to support present body, etc. ; so there is no
question of it being continued to generate future bodies.

​This is true.

​This is not *sAmpradAyika *views as you can deduce on your own after
reading our views.
