Hare Krishna! It is said that jnAna is the sole cause of liberation but a jnani need not have gone through total mano nasa and vasana kshaya. It is said some jnanis don't even sublate kama, krodha etc. If there are desires are left in the mind, won't the sukshuma sarira go in to a new body to enjoy that? How can there be moksha?
