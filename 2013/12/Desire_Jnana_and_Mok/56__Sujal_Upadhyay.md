Namaste,

I would add a little more

Some think that only after all vAsanAs- and thoughts are destroyed, one
enters into samAdhi and then it's over.
 I am of the opinion that By repeatedly entering into samAdhi, i.e. one
enters into samAdhi and then falls back into duality. In this way, he will
destroy all vAsanA-s and finally nothing is left to be destroyed.

Aum

OM

He who lacks faith, lacks all
