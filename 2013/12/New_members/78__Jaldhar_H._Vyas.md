Hi

Im interested in advaita concepts


N.R.Ranganathan

I am the Editor of the monthly spiritual journal GNANA OLI published by Sri 
Gnanananda Mission, Thapovnam.  This journal was started by Sathguru 
Gnanananda Giri swamigal.

Life's upheavals led to me a point where I had ask the question, "Who Am I". 
The Google answered with a link to Sri Ramana Maharshi's book on the very same 
question. That was my initiation to Advaita Vedanta. While the day-to-day 
events are still causing the pleasures and pains, the intensity of these 
upheavals has been reduced drastically, thanks to the literature on Advaita 
Siddhanta on the internet. Hoping this membership leads me to further depths 
of the Siddhanta.
