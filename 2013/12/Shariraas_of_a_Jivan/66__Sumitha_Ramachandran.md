Namaste,
The recent thread has kindled this doubt in me.
What happens to the different shariras like sthoola, sukhma and karana sharira of a Jivan Mukta while living and on death?

If there is no birth at all for them we hear in Gita, sambhavami yugey yugey. The Lord cannot be born as Krishna in this kali yuga. He must take a different form. ( In the form of Nitya Mukta Yogis perhaps)

Pranams,
Sumitha Ramachandran
