Namaste

I have no personal grudge against Sringeri Swamiji. Only I am pointing out
facts everybody can see. In Sringeri history records they have said Muslims
rulers like Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan helped them. But the Sringeri
Swamijis ignored what happened in Somnath in Gujarat.

When they are worshipping Chandra Mauleeshwara Linga comfortably sitting in
Sringeri how can they forget the looting and desecration of Jyotirlinga
Somnath by Ghazni Mohammad for 17 times? How can a Mathadhipati ignore
attacks on Hindu Kshetras and become friendly with the temple looting
terrorists? Is Gujarat not part of Bharata Desha? Are not people of Gujarat
following Sanatan Dharma like people in Sringeri? Some Mysore people also
say in Tippu Sultan's time many Hindus were forcibly converted. His
minister Purniah was Madhva follower. Even today Sringeri people think
Tippu Sultan was good and Purniah was bad. Very strange thinking.
