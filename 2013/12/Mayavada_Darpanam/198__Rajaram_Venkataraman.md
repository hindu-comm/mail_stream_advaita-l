Dear Nithin,

Sri Jaldhar Vyas may resort to ban as he has expressed intolerance to
opposing view point. I would like to post this before that so that
intelligent people may understand it.

Yes, we should critically examine our own texts and other Vedic traditions.
The is required to arrive at the truth and have conviction in our own path.
In this sense, I think Sujal's post of the link is quite relevant as it is
in defence of advaita against attack by Madhwas. However, an intelligent
person will choose the worst of the evil and attack it first. Would you
treat bhagavathas and kapalikas in the same way? You would agree with most
of what the former says but disagree on certain conclusions. With the
latter, you may condemn and even impose ban if you had the power. (If you
are Sri Jaldhar Vyas you may ban both :) as they are anyway wrong from
advaita point of view).

Advaitins - be it Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, Sringeri Acharyas or
any one - did not write any thing to critique Islam or Christianity
but spared no effort against other Hindu traditions. When discussing a
philosophy, we will not only see the content but also the qualities of the
speaker.  Those who defend a philosophy will be forced to defend the
philosopher too - cant shy away from that. Sringeri Acharya admits that
there were excesses by muslims but defends that.  He says that they did it
on the basis if their faith. History tells us what these excesses are -
rape, murder, destruction of temples, cow slaughter, jizya, forced
conversions etc. Is rape of "kafir women" defensible on the basis of faith?
If we treat someone, even a parama bhakta or jnani, as infallible, we will
obstruct truth and justice. We have to pay for such injustice with blood. A
sincere brahmin officer Sri Sankarraman was brutally slaughtered in
a temple 9 years ago. I am glad Sankaracharya and Kanchi Mutt
asssociates were acquitted. However, the people who killed Sankarraman
- missionaries ? - have not been caught and no one is fighting for that.
His is not an isolated slaughter but there are many activists of Hindu
dharma who get killed by religious fanatics even today. It is a fair ask
that those who indulge in polemics should oppose the grossest forms of them
that lead to fundamentalism and terrorism. Is it not?

Proponents of Islam and Christianity, among other things,
attack apaurusheyatva of Vedas, one of the key tenets of vaidhika dharma
http://www.islamhinduism.com/hinduism/analysis/59-origin-of-vedas-their-inspiration-and-authority
Recently, I ran a blog http://apaureshyatva.blogspot.co.uk/ on the
topic where Sri Jaldhar Vyas also
participated. Needless to say that the arguments in favour of
apaurusheyatva were decimated using
Philology, Linguistics etc. Sri Jaldhar Vyas ducked out of the discussion.
I followed it up with Sri Mani
Dravid Sastrigal and made some progress. It is still not
rigorously defensible because we don't
have the required knowledge as a tradition. Hence, I ask scholars to focus
on defending dharmic
traditions instead of in-fighting amongst vaidhikas.

Best Regards
RV
