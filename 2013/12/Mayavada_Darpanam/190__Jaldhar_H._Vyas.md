1. "The pointless polemics" as you call them are equally useful against 
anky kind of monotheism which is basically just an unsophisticated dvaita.

2.  The future of Hinduism belongs to the educated not illiterates no 
matter how much they beat their chests and "oppose."

3.  You have no idea what the author is doing or not doing.  You have no 
idea what anyone on this list is doing or not doing.  So keep your 
editorializing to yourself it is not welcome here.
