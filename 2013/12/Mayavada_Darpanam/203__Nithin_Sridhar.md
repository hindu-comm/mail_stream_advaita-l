Regarding your statement of the basis of Vedas being Apaurusheya. The very
analysis of Vedas from Historical context is faulty and goes contrary to
the tradition. Vedas are not considered a historical development in the
tradition. Hence, historical analysis has only limited value. You may read
this, something I had written on the topic-
http://nithinsridhar.wordpress.com/2013/11/10/the-limitations-of-historical-analysis-in-understanding-hinduism/

The Hinduism or its tenets are not based on Historical validity. Further,
the claim that Rishi's wrote some hymns is absurd. Rishis "Saw" and "Heard"
those hymns in deep samadhi.  So, it was not that they wrote it. This very
understanding is faulty.

Islam and Christianity is based on Historical facts, not Hinduism as such.
Much criticism of historicity of Jesus has been already done in the west so
also the criticism of Islam. Kindly visit-
