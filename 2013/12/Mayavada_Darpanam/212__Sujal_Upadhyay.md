Nithin: Its a fantastic work. Only went through few beginning posts and its
thorough. I feel the author should publish it as book. Sadly, I could not
find a contact id at his blog.

Even I could not find not find contact ID upon searching on net and his
other blogs. All we can do is to post a comment or reply to google+

"To disconnect from the self and to become Aware of anything else is
nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
FAITH IS LIFE, DOUBT IS DEATH - Sri Ramakrishna
