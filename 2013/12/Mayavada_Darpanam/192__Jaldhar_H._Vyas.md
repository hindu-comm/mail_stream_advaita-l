For one thing, if you are in my house you had better speak of dharma as _I_ 
deem fit!  As for this list, it is for the study of Advaita Vedanta as 
taught by Shri Shankaracharya.  Aimless complaints about the state of the 
world are off topic.

All these things share one common quality; they are wrong.  The ways in 
which they express wrongness are irrelevant here though the difference may 
be of interest to the same readers elsewhere.
