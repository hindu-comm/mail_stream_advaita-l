Namaste,

Yes.  Infact, among the several names of subramaNya, one is "guha" which
signify the chit-kaLa in the hridaya-guha which is the source of vAk.

That said, there are sapta-dasha prasthArAs / upAsana rahasyAs of 
subramaNya as per srItattvanidhi (which you possess).  They are:

1. jnAna-shakti subramaNya
2. skanda subramaNya
3. agnijAta subramaNya
4. saurabhEya subramaNya
5. gAngEya subramaNya
6. sharavaNOdbhava subramaNya
7. kArtikEya subramaNya
8. kumAra subramaNya
9. shaNmukha subramaNya
10. tArakAri subramaNya
