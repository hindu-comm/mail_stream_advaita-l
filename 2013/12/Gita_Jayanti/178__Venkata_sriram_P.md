Namaste Jaldharji,

///////////////

Today as well many are despondent as to how they can be dharmic in a world 
where everything seems to be going wrong.  By Bhagavans krpa we have an 
answer in the Gita.

//////////////////

Very true.    

However, "the despondency as to how one can be dharmic" itself comes
with the grace of Lord and hence such a "vishAda" is called "vishAda yOga".

If the despondency is not yoked with dharma, it is just a vishAda only which
every normal being experiences in his daily life.

The answer to such a vishAda-yOga is in bhagavat-gita which is none other than "dharma".

regs,
sriram
