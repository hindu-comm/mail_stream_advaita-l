Namaste,

If there is both abhyAsa and vairAgya, then after the initial phase of
vishAda, one will experience peace within. Nature will also change, but may
go unnoticed. You may realize this when others comment on the change. I say
that the change may go unnoticed because the change is so natural and
gradual that you barely notice.

VairAgya is Ananda, as it is absence of desires (in mind). Less the
dissatisfied desires more is the peace within. Also sattva Guna increases
and other guNa-s decrease with progress. For traditional POV, you may read
21 milestones mentioned in Gita chapter 16 and 17. they are barometer of
our spiritual progress.

"To disconnect from the self and to become Aware of anything else is
nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
FAITH IS LIFE, DOUBT IS DEATH - Sri Ramakrishna
