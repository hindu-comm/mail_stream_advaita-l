>>>Jnana eliminating karma only means that the Jnani realizes that he wasnever a kartA-bhoktA at any point of time: past, present and future. Thus,
the elimination or exhausting of karma is not any process in time. It is
just a knowledge that one is Brahman the akartA-abhoktA.

Subbu Ji has put it rightly. It's the gross misconception that with 'jnanam' everything has to be 'physically known' like the count of balance 'karmas' ( prarabdha). This is because we look at it from the secular / transactional (vyavaharic) sphere where knowledge about any 'things' means 'knowing it' ( those 'things'). Since this 'jnanam'is not a 'thing', this way of 'knowing' doesn't work. One way to understand is that it is the 'eye' of the eye, 'ear' of the ear, 'mind' of the mind, 'food' of the food.. With a little practice one can get to understand (intellectually) that it is the very 'thing' because of which all these are happening. Since it is complete it doesn't have to 'do'/ 'want'/ 'possess' anything. This process of understanding can effectively happen only by the study of the scriptures from a 'sampradayic' 'guru' and grace of iswara.

Namaste,

If there is both abhyAsa and vairAgya, then after the initial phase of
vishAda, one will experience peace within. Nature will also change, but may
go unnoticed. You may realize this when others comment on the change. I say
that the change may go unnoticed because the change is so natural and
gradual that you barely notice.

VairAgya is Ananda, as it is absence of desires (in mind). Less the
dissatisfied desires more is the peace within. Also sattva Guna increases
and other guNa-s decrease with progress. For traditional POV, you may read
21 milestones mentioned in Gita chapter 16 and 17. they are barometer of
our spiritual progress.
