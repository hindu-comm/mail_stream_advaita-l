Yes, this mixture of the really real and the other is indeed the crucial meaning
of mithyAtva. The taittirIya upanishad says, "satyaM ca anRtaM ca satyam
abhavat. yad idaM kiM ca." Accordingly, Sankara bhagavatpAda uses the term
"satyAnRte maithunIkRtya" in the sUtrabhAshya. What SAstra helps us do is to
separate out the satya from the anRta that come to us in a mixed way in all
our sensory experiences.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
