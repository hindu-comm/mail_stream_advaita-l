I think, words cannot convey the meaning. At least I am not able to. You
are assuming that for a Jivanmukta, world exist as distinct from Brahman.
It is not so. A Jnani himself perceives Brahman alone. From Jnani's
standpoint, there is no distinction between Jivanmukta and Videhamukta.

It is only from standpoint of we commoners that such a distinction is made.
