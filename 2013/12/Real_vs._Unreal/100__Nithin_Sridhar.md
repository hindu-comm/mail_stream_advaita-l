Sujal ji,

I agree with the last part that, for a Jivanmukta, the body or any other
non-self does not exist as non-self, but he perceives them as Self alone.
His perception of duality is superseded by the realization of Oneness
attained due to Jnana.

I feel, the only difference between Jivanmukta and Videhamukta is that, the
former maintains an apparent existence apart from Brahman for sake of world
and the latter renounces even such an apparent existence.
