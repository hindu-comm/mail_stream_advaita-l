RV: The mind is a product of ajnAnA just as indriyAs and jagat are. jnAnA
is to realise the only reality Brahman and the non-reality of not only the
jagat but of manas and indriyAs also. How can you, after destruction of
ajnAna and rise of jnAna, perceive anything? What is there to see? You
cannot say that I will see the world as brahman when the realisation that
non-existence of the world has dawned on you.
