Dear Sri Rajaramji,

Practically all the dvaita darshanas hold creation to be real, as real as
their respective ultimate creator. It is only in Advaita darshana that
creation is held to be of a lower order or level of reality as compared to
its " creator " .. The assertion is only by shrutis ( as interpreted by the
advaitn ).

Regards
