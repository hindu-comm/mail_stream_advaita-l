Rajaram ji,

There is Arambha vAda, paraNAma vAda, vivarta vAda, ajAta vAda. Why are
there so many vAda-s.

Perhaps, if you stick to Brahma Satya Jagat MithyA, and then read each and
every verse commented by Shankara even in Gita, then you will notice that
even he has not stick to vivarta vAda

So, either Adi Shankara has failed in his theory OR
We have not understood him

Which one should I choose.

Different pramANa-s are there for persons with different mental make-up and
their inner purity. As I have explained in my earlier mail, every time
there is first person 'I', without which there is no 'You' (second person)
or 'he' (third Person). So you stop at 'I' and not go outward to think
about others. Naturally this world is no no concern to such a person, who
dives deep within to find out the real 'I' (and not Ego).

Questions depends upon the evolution of consciousness.

There is

vyavahArika satya
prAtibhAsika satya
pArmArthika satya

Why Adi Shankara had to use 3 satya-s? Why vyavahAra is called as satya?

Do you think that in olden days, people were so dumb and had blind faith
that they could not even raise question about the reality of this world? If
even a laymen of today can question and conclude that Adi Shankara's
teachings were ridiculous, then do you think that in olden days, during the
time of Adi Shankara, there was not a single men who could question him.
Was Adi Shankara unquestionable?

The thing is the word illusion and mithyA is so much bombarded that we
cannot think of anything else and all answers that we give are said to be
escape attempts. People fail to understand adhikAra bheda. They also accuse
our acharya who revived the vedic tradition, blended karma, bhakti, Jnana
and Yoga, not just by writing commentaries, but by asking us to rise above
duality.

Another important factor that all miss or ignore is adhikAra bheda. Arjuna
was asked to do karma, though Bhagavan praised Jnana. He asked laymen ot
follow bhakti as Jnana Marg (Advaita) is difficult to follow (BG 12.5-6 and
Uddhava Gita Chapter 6, 6.21-22).

If Bhagavan has himself given upadhesha on adhikAra bheda, then there must
be two different paths or say two different explanations. If Bhagavan
himself has given upadesha on adhikAra bheda, then is it not fair to Adi
Shankara to to explain in two ways - practical reality - world is real,
dream is real and absolute reality, the world is mithyA, Brahman is truth.

Perhaps vedenta asks us to renounce vedic karma. Are veda-s and vedanta
opposed to each other?

If you believe in other sampradAya-s like Vaishnava, lease have a look at
their commentary on BG 2.16.

Perhaps the definition of real as Eternal, unchanging, infinite, immutable,
etc are not adapted and sometimes there is a priori.

Please think on these matters.

I strongly advice you to study AND meditate.
