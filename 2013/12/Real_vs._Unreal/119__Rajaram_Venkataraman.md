anyway qualify sastras when they contradict pratyaksha (cold fire, chandra
farther than surya etc.). On the other hand, self examination should lead
to correct conclusion just as we study a pot if we want to know the pot and
we study our self to know our self. Is it not?

RV: I agree that my analogy is flawed but my question is not. The
non-existent world is perceived due to ajnAna. Why do I perceive it after
dawn of knowledge?
