The way Advaita sees it, the 'experiencing the world' itself is a product
of avidya, adhyasa, in other words, a mental construct.   To remove that, a
counter mental construct is advanced: to understand that the
perceiver-perceving-perceived duality, verily a triad, is mithyA.  This is
arrived at by the study of the upanishad with yukti, manana and
nidhidyAsana.  On the one hand this exercise gives one the knowledge of the
underlying Truth, Brahman, the Self and on the other the mithyAtva
nishchaya pertaining to the world-phenomenon.  So, this nishchaya does not
require the vanishing of the triad spoken of above.  It can co-exist with
it.  That is called jivanmukti by Swami Vidyaranya in the Panchadashi.
