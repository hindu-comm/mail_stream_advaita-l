One more thing, World is not tucham- Non-existent like son of barren women.
World is called Mithyam i.e. which has no existence of its own. It takes
its existence from Brahman which is substratum.

In Vyavaharika Dasha, we perceive Ishwara, Jiva and Jagat as 3 distinct
entities. This perception is due to Maya. From Paramartika dasha, Brahman
alone exist. Brahman who is Nirguna himself manifest as Universe in himself
and by himself.

Hence, a Jnani who verily becomes Brahman, perceives his Atman everywhere.
What is understood as world, maya etc as distinct from Brahman becomes
Brahman alone at Jnana.

Hence, such a Jnani, whether he maintains a body or not does not
matter.Just as God himself too avatara as Krishna by his own power,
similarly a Jnani maintains his body for lila.
