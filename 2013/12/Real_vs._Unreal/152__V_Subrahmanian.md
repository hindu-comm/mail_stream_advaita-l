The fallacy lies in expecting that the effect should cease the moment the
cause is ended.  When a raging fire is quelled by firefighters the heat,
smoke, etc. caused by the fire do not cease at that very moment.  The
effects are seen for a while.  Even after a person has ceased to shout in
an open space, the echo persists for a second.  Crackers burst leave a
lingering sound even after the burst.

Taking the above analogy further, the heat, etc. continuing for sometime
does not cause another raging fire.  Similarly the effect of avidyA that
lasts for sometime is like the snake that is de-fanged, like a seed that is
burnt that cannot germinate, will not cause samsAra.  That is why the
jnAni's karma post-realization does not lead to rebirth/reaping the fruits
thereof in another loka, etc.

No one needs to teach one as to how to see a mirage phenomenon. Even after
knowing it is a mirage a person continues to see the phenomenon with the
awareness of the absence of water there.

By 'soul' if the Atman is meant, yes, the Atman is never touched by the
changes.  But the 'person' who thought that he is the body/mind, is the one
who now knows that he is not the body-mind but the Atman.  For him, the
knower, the mithyAtvanishchaya with regard to the body-mind and its
affectations is surely of help.
