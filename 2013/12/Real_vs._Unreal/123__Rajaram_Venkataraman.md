> RV: Vedanta means that the conclusion s a synthesis of all knowledge. We
have to suppose omniscience with respect to the teacher, sastras or
Ishwara. Teachers don't claim omniscience (leave alone the yogic state that
Madhusudana refers to).  Ishwara is known only through sastras. Sastras are
not inerrant (e.g. chandra farther than surya). In my understanding,
sampradaya accepts sastras as omniscient but does not treat sabda pramana
as inerrant as Christians or Muslims treat bible or quran. We treat sabda
as the authority with respect to unseen (result of dharma, devas, Ishwara
etc.) but don't blindly accept when it contradicts pratyaksha or anumana.
If sastras say fire is cold, we won't conclude that it is so and touch it
as pratyaksha pramana tells us otherwise. In relation to the current
topic, though sastras say that the world is unreal, we are forced to accept
its reality as long as we see it.

> RV: If sastras are established as the authority with respect to atma
vidya, yes but self is self-evident unlike devas, dharma etc. that can only
be known through sastras. sastras or logic can only challenge
my mis-conceptions of my self. They cannot illumine what is already known -
the self-  as it lead to the fallacy of teaching the obvious. I may
incorrectly conclude that I'm happy or sad but sastras (or logic) can tell
me that these are characteristics of my mind not my self. Imay say that I'm
transient but sastras (or logic)can tell me I'm eternal. They can only
remove misconceptions about my self by challenging the conclusions drawn by
the mind.
