VS and VM ji has explained beautifully

If you take only pratyaksha pramAna, and leave other 5, then you will not
believe that you are jiva. Have you ever experienced yourself as jiva? If
no, then how can you say that 'I am Jiva' If you say shastra-s are
pramANa-s, then shastra-s from advaita POv say that you are Brahman.

One the other hand, if what is said in shastra-s cannot be experienced then
of what use are shastra-s for us?

What matters is the path - Jagat satya is a destination or a truth that has
to be realized.

OM
