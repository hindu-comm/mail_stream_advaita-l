RV: We see mAyA only from a vyavahara perspective as the cause of
vyavahara. Even now, we dont think mAyA binds Brahman. As of now, we think
Brahman manifests as jagat through the instrument of maya. Once you attain
jnAnA, there is no mAyA (or ajnAnA). Then where is the question of being
bound by mAyA or seeing its effects?
