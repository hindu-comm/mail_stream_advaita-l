We see mirage (jagat) only due to the sun (ajnAna) not in its absence at night. If the presence of the world is due to ajnAnA, how can you see it after jnAnA has destroyed it? How can you see a pot space after the pot has been destroyed?

I don't think you can say that there is reality or existence for the world and still claim to be an advaitin. The upanishadic assertion that only clay is real negates the reality of the pot etc. totally not in any relative sense.

Yes, it has existence, Rajaram Ji (none can deny it, because we are experiencing it!) - but, transactionally not absolutely i.e it is ever changing putting one into a fix disabling him from really pin point and say - yes, this is it. By the time he says so it would have changed forcing him to say - not this - ma ya.

The mistake we often make is about the 'real & unreal'. Dream is 'the reality' while I am in the 'dream state' - the 'dream thirst' is for 'real', for my throat and mouth are parched up and it's quenched when I drink the 'dream water' - and 'realises' its unreality on waking up. So the real & unreal are not absolute but relative. Now the world I experience in the 'waking state' is also 'unreal' when I gain 'self knowledge'. Here the sublimation is in a different way. Even after the self knowledge the world exists as the 'mirage' is still seen after knowing the 'unreality' of the mirage water. It's an understanding. As one clears the existing vasanas & prarabdhams in such a way that no new ones are being added, he /she will finally stop from falling in to this stubborn dream (samasara) again. Since enquiring the 'world' leads to infinite regression, it is advised to look for 'brahman', knowing which the unreal disappears as the darkness goes with
 light.

I think the scholars are missing my question or argument. Let me re-phrase for clarity. We don't need sastras or a guru to determine a. I exist or b. The world is not what it appears to be. My existence is self - evident to me. I know that a pot is clay, which in turn is made of elements, which in turn is form of energy. A pot is not what it appears to be. I need sastras only to tell me of things I can't know otherwise - the future effect of dharma and adharma, existence of unseen realities such as devas and Ishwara. 

The world is not what it appears to be but the question is whether it has existence or not is the question. The inevitability of the experience of a pot even for a jnani makes us wonder whether his conclusion that the world was never created and does not exist is true. If we see water on a desert land during summer afternoon, we will think its a mirage but if we see it even after the sun sets (equivalent of dawn of knowledge), will we say that there's no water?

Yes, this mixture of the really real and the other is indeed the crucial meaning
of mithyAtva. The taittirIya upanishad says, "satyaM ca anRtaM ca satyam
abhavat. yad idaM kiM ca." Accordingly, Sankara bhagavatpAda uses the term
"satyAnRte maithunIkRtya" in the sUtrabhAshya. What SAstra helps us do is to
separate out the satya from the anRta that come to us in a mixed way in all
our sensory experiences.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
