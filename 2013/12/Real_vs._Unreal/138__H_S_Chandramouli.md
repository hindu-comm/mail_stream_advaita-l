I think it would be useful to breakdown the issue to a few separate
questions and discuss them individually. Based on the response i got from
sri RV to one of my earlier mails, i think the first question to be
addressed is the status of existence of creation. I want to make the
following statement.

< As per the shrutis, creation exists >.

I do not want at this stage to mix up issues like the mithyatva/satyatva,
jnana/ajnana, whether a jnani sees it or not etc. The status of creation
can be discussed subsequently based on Sri RVs response. I would like to
ask Sri RV if he agrees with this straightforward statement or not. There
are any number of shruti vakyas in support of this statement which i can
quote if needed. However if Sri RV disagrees with this statement, which i
suspect would be the case based on his previous response, I request him to
quote any shruti vakya in support. We can then see if any different
explanation is to be ascribed to the same. May i request Sri RV to respond.
If he agrees with this statement, then i would like to takeup the next
posssible point of disagreement.

Regards
