H S CHANDRAMOULI

Dear Sri Subrahymanyamji,

I am a little bit confused on your reply. I couldnt refer to Panchadashi
immediately as i am out of town. But the word Pragnanaghana is applicable
to the condition in sushupti only ( refer mandukya ) and not to the other
two states. You seem to have mentioned exactly the opposite. Have I
misunderstood you. kindly clarify.

Regards
