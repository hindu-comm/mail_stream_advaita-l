PraNams to all.

I am forwarding a question posed by a sincere seeker in private mail, since the discussion may be relevant to many. I am not posting my answer to him to the list. Those who want to address the issue raised by the seeker are welcome. If the answer differs from mine and is relevant, I will definitely forward that to him.

Hari Om!
