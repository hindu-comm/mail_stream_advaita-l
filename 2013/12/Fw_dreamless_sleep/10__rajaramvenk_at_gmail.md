Namaste

We will know dreamless sleep happened because we can see some time has
passed after waking up. But the waking is also Vyavahara Satya only. In
dream less sleep we cannot know waking and in waking we cannot know
dreamless sleep. Dreamless sleep and waking and dream sleep also are not
true in Paramartha. There is no problem. The question is confusing and the
asking person is confused.
