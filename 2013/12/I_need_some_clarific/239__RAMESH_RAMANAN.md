Dear members of the Advaita Vedanta board,

Pranams,

I need some clarifications and assistance of the members for the following:

1) Is it possible for a person to assume or take over the responsibility for the karma sesham (balance of karma) and papa-sesham (balance of sins, if any) of a dead person and make suitable amends/ atonement for the same, so that the dead person is totally relieved from having to undergo the cycle of births and deaths? I am asking this specifically, because my beloved father expired in tragic circumstances, due to a severe brain hemorrage. He was not aware of Atma-vichara or Self-enquiry, though he used to chant the names of God everyday. I want him to be liberated from this worldly births and deaths and not suffer again, because he had suffered too much in this life.

If the answer to the above question is yes, I would like to know the steps that I can adopt to achieve this. I would love to undergo all pain and disease to ensure that my father is liberated from rebirths, because he sacrificed most of his life for all of us and lived a honest man's life. He was never given to harsh words towards anyone and he had a by-pass surgery in 2009 and suffered from urine catheter problems for nearly four years till the end. 


2) is it possible for me to communicate with the spirit of my father and find out his current position? Is there anyone who can really help me in this regard? Do the members of the board know someone who can be trusted in this matter? I would not like to meet quacks or pretentious people. 


3) I would like to have a small Shiva temple (location: somewhere within Chennai, Tamil Nadu, to which I can take my aged mother easily) constructed in memory of my father with a small inscription "This temple has been built in loving memory of Sri V.V. Ramanan, by his wife, Srimati Vathsala Ramanan and his sons, Dr. Prakash Ramanan, Ramesh Ramanan and Sri Kumaran Ramanan."

My TOTAL budget for the same is Rs 8-10 lakhs.

I would like a reputed organization to come forward to take up this task and take care of all aspects of the the future management of the temple, including regular pooja, rituals, festivals, Kumbhibishekam, further funding, upkeep and maintenance of the temple, etc. My mother is aged 75 and may not be around for the completion of the construction of the temple and hence, would like to see the inscription being placed in front of the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Shiva at the beginning of the construction itself. Can any members of this board suggest a good authority who can be contacted in this regard? I do not want the temple to be left unattended and uncared for, and I want it to be handed over to reputed spiritual/religious authorities, who will have to ensure that they will take care of all aspects of the temple. 


The temple should have the idols of Lord Ganesha, Lord Shiva, Parvati, Lord Karthikeya and their respective vehicles (Vaahana). I do not know whether it is possible to build a temple within this very limited budget, but I would like to try and find out. 


Sorry for the long post and sincere thanks in advance for replies from the members of the board.

With sincere thanks, Pranms,
Ramesh Ramanan.
