As far as Upanishads is concerned nature of Brahman is explained as "Satyam
Jnanam and Anantam". The Sat corresponds to Satyam and Chit corresponds to
Jnanam.

These three are not three qualities but three aspects of Brahman. By, Sat
or Satyam it means Brahman alone exist. He is the only Reality which is
true all the time. Hence, he is Birthless and Infinite. A finite entity is
subject to place, time, form and other finiteness. But Brahman is beyond
finiteness. Hence is Anantam- Infinite. Further he is Jnanam i.e. the very
nature of Knowledge. There is nothing he does not know nor any knowledge
exist apart from him. Brahman being Sat or very existence is also the
nature of Jnanam/Knowledge/Consciousness. In other words, Brahman is not
inert entity. Instead he is "Conspicuousness/Chit". By extension, He who is
Sat, Chit and Anantam should also be Anandam- Blissful. Bliss means free
from sorrow. This bliss is different from sukha in that, sukha is temporary
but bliss is permanent/eternal.

Hence, Brahman is described as Sat, Chit and Anand.
