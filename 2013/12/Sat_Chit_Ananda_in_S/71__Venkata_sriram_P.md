Namaste,

It is not that these 3 are the hardcore definitions of brahma-tattva.  

If jagat-bhAva (nAma & rUpa) is sublated from the aspect of 
asti, bhAti, priyaM, nAmam & rUpaM, what remains is the 
"best approximation" for brahmAnubhUti.  

The definition is akin to the experience of a dumb who 
can't express the taste of jaggery in words.

regs,
sriram
