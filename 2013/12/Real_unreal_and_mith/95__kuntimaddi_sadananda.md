 Dear Nitin bhai,

 I think unreal does not mean mithyA. Or say what is the
 english word for
 asatya?

 Satya = Real / truth
 asatya = ?
 mithyA (in between) = ? - that which is transient
 experience.

 My English is poor

 Also what is the difference between anitya and mithyA?

 According to my understanding, anitya means that which is
 non-self and is
 perishable. So if I destroy a cloth, it's irreversible end
 product is ash,
 which is visible.

 While in snake-rope analogy, when snake disappears, it does
 not leave any
 trace, like it's curved path, etc.

 Adi Shankara in Tatva Bodh defines both anitya and mithya
 separately.

 In Jnana Drishti, the world is negated and not destroyed.
 that is nirvikalp
 samadhi. Then there is another word, satvam khalu-idam
 brahma. 'Idam' :)

 Sri Ramana Maharshi says, when you look at shadow, then sun
 is not visible,
 when you look at sun, you cannot see shadow. Similarly, when
 you clearly
 experience this world, you do not experience Brahman. when
 you clearly
 experience Brahman which world is not visible.

 Body is Jnani is Jnana itself (consciousness). It is not
 physical body, but
 the substratum of entire universe is his body (i.e.
 Brahman).

 Aum
