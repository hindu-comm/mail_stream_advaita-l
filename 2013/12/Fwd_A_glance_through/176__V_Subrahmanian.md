The Agrahara Vidyaranyapura was established by King Harihara II of
Vijayanagara Empire in the year 1386 in the memory of Jagadguru Sri
Vidyaranya Mahaswamiji, the 12th Guru of Sringeri Sri Sharada Peetham.
Vidyaranyapura is a small and quiet Agrahara with a number of little
shrines, nestling on the bank of River Tunga. This book is written by Prof.
G S Ramachandra after making a special study about Sringeri and the
villages surrounding it. He has given the authentic and interesting
information about the History and geography of Vidyaranyapura.
