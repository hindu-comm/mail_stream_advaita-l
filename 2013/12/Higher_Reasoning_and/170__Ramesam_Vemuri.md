Respected Members,

Maybe some of the Members have already seen this 15 min  Video of Rupert
Spira on Contemplative thinking vs. Addictive thinking:

http://non-duality.rupertspira.com/watch/higher-reasoning-and-imagination

I am taking the liberty to post it here because, I felt it provides a lot
of clarity with regard to the issue of  "control of thought."

For those of us who may not be aware, Rupert comes with about twenty years
background in  a  Shankaracharya school.

regards,
