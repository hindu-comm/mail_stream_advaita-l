It is exactly this 'knowability' 'dRshyatvam' that makes avidyA a viShaya,
object, and therefore not Atma dharma but only anAtmadharma.

This is not denied at all.  Vidyaranya as said that hunger, thirst, joy,
sorrow, knowledge, ignorance etc. are known to oneself pratyakSheNa and to
others only by inference.

You have come to the point.  We are therefore not disagreeing : ) ..avidyA
is 'in' the mind and therefore not in the Atman. That is what Shankara says
in that diaglogue.

I have already shown that in the Br.up. 1.4.10 bhashyam Shankara Himself
has said that avidyA is to be admitted in/for Brahman.  [this is not to be
confused with what I said above: avidyA is an attribute of the anAtmA and
not of the Atman.)

This is exactly the teaching of the 13th chapter of the Gita.  The entire
avidyA/mAyAkAryam is the kShetra which is the known, as 'idam', and the
kShetrajna is the knower, vEttA.  Only that which is a viShaya, known,
dRshya can be an object.  And that is why it can be annihilated by vidyA.

Maybe you wanted to say here 'It is avidyAkalpita'.
