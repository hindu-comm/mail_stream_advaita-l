Avidyaa . Another person cannot say I have Avidyaa. I have to know and say

Avidyaa or not.

This is showing Avidyaa is a Misconception in the mind. It is Subjective.

But Teekaakaras are telling us there is a Moola Avidya attached to Brahman.
This Moola Avidyaa is Maayaa Shakti. It has created the world and we are
all seeing that Objective Avidyaa. But Adi Sankara said that Maayaa Shakti
is imagined by Avidyaa in the mind. It is Maayaa Kalpitaa.

Self. He did not say Moola Avidyaa is cause for Adhyaasa. Post Sankara
Vyaakhyaanakaaras are saying that.
