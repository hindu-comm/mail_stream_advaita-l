But in 'Brahman assuming the jIvabhAva due to avidyA' Whose Avidyaa it is?
If you say Brahma has taken Jeevabhava because of his own Avidyaa it is not
correct because Brahma cannot have Avidyaa. If you say Brahma has taken
Jeevabhava because of Jeeva's Avidyaa there is a circular logic. Who is
first? Jeeva or Jeeva's Avidyaa? If Jeeva is first - How Brahma became that
Jeeva without Avidyaa? If Jeeva's Avidyaa is first - how that Avidyaa came
without Jeeva? You have not solved the Problem. The correct answer is
Avidyaa is for person having the Adhyaasa. Jeeva, Ishwara and Maayaa are
imagined through Avidyaa.
