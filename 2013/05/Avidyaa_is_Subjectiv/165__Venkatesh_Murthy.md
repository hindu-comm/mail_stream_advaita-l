Namaste

In 'Method of Vedanta' book SSS Swamiji gives Sureshwara's opinion in Page
314. He is answering a question Who is Ashraya for Avidyaa? Self or not
Self. He is saying not Self is arising from Avidyaa only. Avidyaa cannot
have Ashraya in a thing produced by it. Na Anaatmanaha Ajnaanitvam Na Api
Tad Vishayam Ajnaanam. He has said Ashraya for Avidyaa is Self only.
Parisheshyaad Atmanaha Eva Astu Ajnaanam Tasya 'Ajno Asmi' Iti Anubhava
Darshanaat.

But trick question is Who is Ashraya for Avidyaa? Jeeva or Brahma? It is is
trick question because Jeeva is not Anaatma only. Brahma and Jeeva are not
different. But Jeeva has Upadhis like body.
