I have already shown that in the Br.up. 1.4.10 bhashyam Shankara Himself
has said that avidyA is to be admitted in/for Brahman.  [this is not to be
confused with what I said above: avidyA is an attribute of the anAtmA and
not of the Atman.)

Without considering & clarifying  the context in which shankara apparently 
implied that  avidyA is brahmAshrita, I think you will be doing advaita 
hAni or siddhAnta hAni.  Do you really mean here in this bhAshya shankara 
talking about brahmAshrita avidyA without jeeva aspect  !!??  dont you 
remember in this same maNtra  bhAshya itself shankara clearly says 
nAvidyAkartru bhrAntaM cha brahma ??  and how can we forget the sUtra 
bhAshya where shankara clearly says : yat sarvajnaM sarva shakti brahma 
nityashuddhabuddhamukta svabhAvaM shAreerAt adhikaM anyat tat vayaM 
jagataH srashtru brumaH...... Ishwarasya .....nityanivruttAvidyAtvAt...do 
you mean to say here by taking avdiyA Ashraya brahma become jeeva? 
because, as you know,  there is no provision here in advaita for the 
second 'chaitanya' apart from THAT.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
