By looking at sayings and behaviour of another person we cannot very
definitely say he has Avidyaa.Why? Because Mukta persons have also shown
bad behaviour like Kashyapa Rishi with his wife in Sandhyaa Kaala.Only I
can say definitely I have Avidyaa because I know I am not Happy always.This
is the one and only test. If I am always Happy I am Mukta. If I am
sometimes Happy and sometimes Unhappy I am Baddha. I do not know another
person he is always Happy or not Happy.

In Method of Vedanta SSS Swamiji has given objection of Bhaskaracarya like
this. If you say Avidyaa belongs to Jeeva there is circularity. Jeeva is
Avidyaa Kalpita. But Whose Kalpana? It cannot be Brahma's Kalpana because
Brahma cannot have Kalpana. It is Jeeva's Avidyaa Kalpana. This will be
Jeeva. You are saying Jeeva is Jeeva's Avidyaa Kalpita. There is a circular
logic.

But if you say Avidya is attached to Brahma it is impossible because Brahma
cannot have Avidya. He has no defects.

The BEST ANSWER to Question Whose Avidyaa? is already given by Adi Sankara
I have already given it . I am giving it below once again -

We are seeing Creation of Avidyaa Kalpita Maaya Shakti. That Avidyaa is a
Misconception in the Mind or Superimposition of Self and not Self. The
Creation is not Objective  but Subjective.

Maybe you wanted to say here 'It is avidyAkalpita'.

Correct. Maayaa is  Avidyaa Kalpitaa.
