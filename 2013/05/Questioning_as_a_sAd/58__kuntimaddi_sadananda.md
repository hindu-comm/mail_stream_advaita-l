PraNAms 

In the 18th Chapter Krishna also says not to teach this knowledge to those who are not subject to discipline.
idante naatapaskaaya naabhaktaaya kadaachana|
nachaashushruuShave vaachyam maam yo2bhyasuuyate||

Also Krishna glorifies the teachers who teach this knowledge to those who deserve and approach them with sincere desire to know. 

Hari Om!
