Also Krishna glorifies the teachers who teach this knowledge to those who 
deserve and approach them with sincere desire to know.

It is very true that the teacher should not 'pass' his secret knowledge to 
an 'ayOgya' or 'anadhikAri' disciple.  But irony is that now-a-days, we 
have been seeing Acharya-s or traditional teachers, who are supposed to 
maintain the secrecy of this  guhyAtiguhya  vidya, writing volumes & 
volumes  on this vidyA with all available details, giving public lectures 
on upanishad rahasya vidyA which is supposed to be taught to the 'able' 
shishya on 1:1 basis.  There was a time when they used to say, when 
shishya is ready (pakva), guru himself will approach him till then 
struggle hard to purify your mind..But I think those days have gone, 
irrespective of 'adhikAra' 'yOgyata' this vidya has become an open secret 
to one and all :-))  Perhaps this would be one of the reasons, today, we 
have somany versions of same vedAnta jnAna with conflicting view points 
from various schools of thought like dvaita, advaita, v.advaita etc.. Just 
thinking aloud..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
