Shree Venkatesh - PraNAms
Advaita differentiates praatibhaasika and vyaavahaarika or jiiva sRiShTi and Iswara sRiShTi - snake is permanently negated once the adhiShTaanam, the rope, is recognized since snake where the rope is the particular jiiva's sRiShTi, as others may not see the snake where that rope is. This is similar to wild elephant of yours or your imagination of hares with horns. 
In the case of Iswara sRiShTi, even after knowing it is nothing but Brahman, the perception of plurality remains as long the perceiving equipments BMI are there. The example of miragewaters or sunset and sunrise etc were provided. Knowing that sun never rises or sets, does not eliminate the sunrise and sunset.Knowing that everything fundamentally electons and protons does not negate the garbage from food. Hence Knowledge at the level of individual mind (Jnaani's mind) does not eliminate the Iswara sRiShTi since the creation is not by the jiiva's mind but by the total mind which is Iswara. 
There is a difference between the two although everything is nothing but Brahman, by definition. Whatever experienced is mithyaa. That which has no locus for experience is asat. These are clear and clean definitions. 
If you do not want to appreciate the difference between the two that is your prerogative. I will stop here.
Hari Om!
