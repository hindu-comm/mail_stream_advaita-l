Words like "consciousness" carry different shades of meaning in popular
discourse. One has to be careful while using them. When Sri Subrahmanian
uses the expression "consciousness principle" he is referring to the Atman.
This is not the same as the "life principle" you are referring to. The
difference between a living body and a dead one is not the absence of Atman
in the latter (which would be absurd in the context of advaita-vedAnta),
but the absence of prANa in the latter.

As such, the Atman is the adhiShThAna of all entities, whether living, dead
or non-living.
