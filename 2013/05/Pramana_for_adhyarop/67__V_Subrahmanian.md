By saying 'untrue' what is meant is 'not absolutely real'.  For that
matter, even the latter, the jnAnakANDa, is not absolutely real.  This is
because there is no real bondage and therefore no real effort to come out
of bondage and attain liberation. The entire Veda belongs to vyAvahArika
satya where alone the endeavor to attain any puruShArtha takes place.  The
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.3.22, while discussing the Moksha state, gives
the analogy of the deep sleep state, so that one can see the similarities
like absence of dvaita, duHkha, presence of uncreated sukha, freedom from
all upAdhis, etc:

अत्र पिता अपिता भवति, माता अमाता, लोका अलोका, देवा अदेवा, वेदा अवेदा । अत्र
स्तेनोऽस्तेनो भवति, भ्रूणहाऽअभ्रूणहा, चाण्डालोऽचाण्डालः, पौल्कसोऽपौल्कसः,
श्रमणोऽश्रमणः, तापसोऽतापसः, अनन्वागतं पुण्येन अनन्वागतं पापेन, तीर्णो हि
तदा सर्वाञ्छोकान्हृदयस्य भवति ।

[In this state a father is no father, a mother no mother, ……gods no gods, the
Vedas no Vedas.  In this state a thief is no thief, the killer of a noble
brahmaNa no killer, …a monk no monk, a hermit no hermit..This form of his
is untouched by good work and untouched by evil work, for he is then beyond
all the woes of his intellect.]

That shows that according to the Upanishad, the Veda is not absolutely
true, that is, it does not obtain in the Moksha state.

Also, the Taittiriya upanishad, 'satyam cha anRtam cha satyam abhavat' is
the pramANam for the three levels of satyam: pAramArthika satyam (Brahman),
vyAvahArika satyam (our daily world of experience) and prAtibhAsika satyam
(called anRtam in this mantra which refers to the rope-snake kind of
experiences in the day-to-day life.  Thus, this mantra takes into account
the entire gamut of human experience.
