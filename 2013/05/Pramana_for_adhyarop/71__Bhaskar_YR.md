Thanks a lot for sharing H.H. saMvAda on sarvavyApakatva of vishNu..I 
especially liked the below explanation by H.H.

// quote //

It is seen in his mUrti as holding up a chakraM (disc) in the right hand 
and a shangkham (conch) in the left hand. But there would be space between 
his bhujaM (arm) and the hand that holds the disc, right? Would there be 
BhagavAn in that space? If he is not there, the sarva-vyapakatvaM for the 
Bhagavan would be gone. If he is there, the concept that the very MUrti 
with those limbs is BhagavAn would be gone? Does BhagavAn pervade only 
that space? He pervades the space of his stance, the VaikuNThaM he resides 
in, and all the fourteen worlds? Without creating the space in him where 
he is not there, how can a MUrti be created? Therefore, to think that what 
is with MUrti is only BhagavAn, since it 'does hAni to' (ruins) his 
sarva-vyApakatvaM, would only be apachAraM.
