Bhaskar ji,

When it is said 'freedom from upAdhi-s' it means ' temporary freedom from
their upadrava : ) It is not absolute freedom from upAdhis which will occur
only on brahmajnAna/mokSha.  In suShupti the upAdhi-s are in avyakta form.
See Mandukya upanishad mantra 5: ekIbhUtaH prajnAnaghaanaH for which the
bhashyam is: ..ata eva svapnajAgranmanaHspandanAni prajnAnAni
ghanIbhUtAnIva sEyamavasthA *avivekarUpatvAt* prajnAnaghana ucyate.  yathA
rAtrau naishena tamasA avibhajyamAnam sarvaM ghanamiva tadvat....

In the state of sleep all the upaadhis have merged,become one, as it were
and therefore are not experienced as distinct from one another.  The jiva
is unable to identify with his deha, manaH, patItva, putratva, kartRtva,
brAhmaNatva, etc. upAdhis.  It is not that they have become lost or
destroyed.  That is why upon waking up he is able to continue with those
upAdhis.  He is in suShupti, 'nirupAdhika iva' and that is the suShupti
upamAna svArasya with mokSha.  In mokSha the upAdhis are not there at all.
In jIvanmukti, they are all bAdhita but anuvRtta.  That is, they are
sublated by knowledge but continue for the rest of the life and known by
him as mithyA, just appearance, like mirage water, as per the Bhashya on BG
2.16.

Therefore there is no contradiction.
