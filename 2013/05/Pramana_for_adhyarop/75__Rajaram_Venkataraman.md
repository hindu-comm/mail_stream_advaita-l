RV: we see two sentient beings love each other in this world and enjoy each
other's love. neither of them become insentient because of being an object
of enjoyment. what is the logic in saying that a jiva will be jada if he is
enjoyed by the lord. If the jiva is absolutely different from the Lord,
then there is a defect of the Lord being dependent on some thing other than
Him for bliss but if the Lord uses His eternal energies for His enjoyment,
then He is self satisfied. Is it not?

that says maya cannot produce a form beyond space and time? Leave alone the
Upanishads, even Madhusudana says that the Lotd's eternal form is not made
of pancha bhutas, which includes space. Sankara also says it is aprakrtam.
