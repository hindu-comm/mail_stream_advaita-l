Shree Venkatesh - PraNAms
The word
asat is used in the scriptures and in prakaraNa granthaas in the sense of
mithyaa. If the world is seen for Goudapaada to discuss about it then it is mithyaa by definition- dRisytavaat.See the discussion of Subbuji on Geeta II-16 where Krishna uses
asat and Shankara interprets it as mithyaa. 
The point is one has
to understand contextually what is the meaning implied in the slokas by the word asat.It is obvious from your posts that a proper teacher is required to understand correctly.Considering these problemsthat arise due tomisinterpretations,scripture itself advises to approach a teacher -
praapyavaraan nibhodata, tat viddhi praNipaatena pariprashnena sevayaa, tat
vijnaanaartham sa gurum eva abhigacchet, etc. 
I have provided one reference for
understanding GK - here it is againhttp://www.chinmayadc.org/sadananda.htm
ManDuya and other texts are presented. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda
