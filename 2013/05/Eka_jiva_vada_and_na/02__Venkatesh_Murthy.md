Namaste

You said -
The word asat is used in the scriptures and in prakaraNa granthaas in the
sense of mithyaa.

I agree with this but Gaudapada and Adi Sankara have nowhere said this
Mithya is Not Sat and Not Asat or Sat Asat Vilakshana. This is purely
invented by Advaitis afterwards to confuse Purva Pakshis like Naiyayikas
and Dvaitis. Mithya is also Asat only. There is no other meaning for
Mithya. This is my final conlusion and I will stop.
