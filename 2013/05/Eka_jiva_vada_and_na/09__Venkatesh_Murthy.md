Namaste

Sri Sadananda has said if you imagine hare's horns it is Mithya for you
like the seen objects. Then hare's horns and seen objects like table are
Mithya. But Brahma is everything. The Mithya things also have Brahma Adhara
only. The Mithya things are also Brahma only.

Adi Sankara has said in Mundaka 2 - 2 -11 - Brahmaivedam Jagat Samastamidam
Jagad Varishtham Varatamam. Abrahma Pratyayaha  Sarvopyavidyamatraha
Rajjvamiva Sarpa Pratyayaha. Brahmaivaikam Satyamiti Vedanushasanam.

If you think of any Abrahma 'Not Brahma' thing it is Avidya only like a
Snake in Rope. That Abrahma thing is not there any where in the Universe.

If you think of hare's horns it is Brahma only. If you are seeing a table
it is Brahma only. If you are seeing Snake in a Rope the Snake is Brahma
and Rope is also Brahma.
