I want to see which Sutra Number and Adhyaya or Adhikarana. Otherwise I
cannot believe your saying.

Hare Krishna

01.  avyaktA hi sA mAyA tatvAnyatva nirUpaNasya ashakyatvAt
02.  kiM punasthat karma yat prAgutpatteH IshwarajnAnasya vishayO bhavati 
iti??  tattvAnyatvAbhyAm anirvachaniye nAmarUpe avyAkrute

I can give more references, but kindly find out these two quotes first 
from sUtra bhAshya.  Hint :  it is in very first adhyAya :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
