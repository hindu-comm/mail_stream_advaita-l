Shree Venkatesh -PraNAms. Just for some clarification since you are referring to my words.

What I said is if you create an object it is jiiva's creation, using of course the components from the memory which is stored from the past experiences. That is praatibhaasika - this includes the snake on the rope. Knowledge of the adhiShTaanam eliminates the projection.

If you see the Iswara's creation as part of the table etc which is vyavahaarika satyam. It is assembled using the panca bhuutas that are created by Iswara only. That is the rope itself. It also includes the mirajwaters, sunrise and sunset, crystal appearing as red due to proximity of red flower, etc. Knowledge of the fact does not eliminate the appearences. This includes the knowledge of the Brahman also - the appearence of the Iswara sRiShTi continues. 
Everything is self-consistent. 

Both are mithyaa since they are experienced -It is, thereforeI see it -mostly vyaavahaarika;vs I see it, therefore it is - mostly praatibhaasika. 

Please note bhrama is different from Brahman. bhramaa is false knowledge in contrast to pramaa, valid knowledge - Pramaa is gained by pramaaNa and it is well defined. See Vedanta Paribhaasha analysis in my website. 

Any experience is mithyaa, by definition - since it is experienced. 
The definitions are precise. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
