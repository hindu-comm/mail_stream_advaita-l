Namaste,
//can't the "laukika sanyAsi-s" cut cakes as a way of anugraha fortheir "laukika-bhakta-s"//
If they succumb to the pressures of such laukika bhaktAs, then the yati-dharmaitself would be at stake and gets diluted.
That said, surEshwarAchArya had already said about such yatis which implies thatsuch sanyasis had already existed before.
