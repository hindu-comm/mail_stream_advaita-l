Namaste, Sriram ji.

Whether it is 'succumbing to pressure' or eagerness to go little *more* out
of the way (than the *sAmpradAyika yati*-s) to confer anugraham - we don't
know, sir. It is best to remain safe and not judge people doing spiritual
dispensation.

And yes spurious *yati*-s were there even in *rAmAyaNa* times!
*Ravana*being the most noted.

By the way, it was said in a *panchAnga SravaNam* for *vijayanAma
samvatsaram* - that this year the activity spurious swami-s will be on the
rise!!

*tasmAt jAgrata*!!
