Namaste,

I read quite sometime ago that the bhashya of the Nrsimha-Purva-Tapaniya was written by Gaudapada and the bhashya on the Nrsimha-Uttara-Tapaniya was written by Shankara Bhagavadpada. Do you think this is possible?

Regards,
Sunil KB

Subject: [Advaita-l] From the 'ShankaravijayaH'......


In the 'srImacChankaradigvijayaH' of Sri VidyAraNya SwAmin we have the
mention of the following in sarga 6 titled 'AtmavidyApratiShThA' -

ततो महाभारतसारभूताः स व्याकरोद्भागवतीश्च गीताः ।
सनत्सुातीयमसत्सुदूरं ततो नृसिम्हस्य च तापनीयम् ॥ ६२ ॥

ग्रन्थानसंख्यांस्तदनुपदेशसाहस्रिकादीन् व्यदधात्सुधीड्यः ।
..................................................................॥ ६३ ॥

(Apart from the brahmasutra and upanishdbhAShyams.....Shankaracharya
composed the following works: BhagavadgItAbhAShyam, sanatsujAtIya
bhAShyam, nRsimhatApanIya
upanishadbhaashyam... and countless works such as the UpadeshasAhasrI... )

That Shankaracharya  composed the nRsimhatApanIya upanishadbhaashyam is
noteworthy from the above account.
