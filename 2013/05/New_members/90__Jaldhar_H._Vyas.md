Once again I have been unavoidably detained with samsarika matters and as 
a result I haven't been attending to advaita-l matters regularly.  So my 
deepest apologies to the following new members for the delay in adding 
them to the list.


Harihara Sarma

Male of 69 years  retired living in a community of senior citizens .By
nature a theist but not a firm believer of sampradayas .

Please include me in this group.  This will help me to teach my 2 children.
