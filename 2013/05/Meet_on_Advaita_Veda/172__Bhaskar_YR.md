Whilst later texts can certainly aid one’s reflection, a deep direct 
understanding of Shankara’s bhashya works, and Upadesha Sāhasrī should be 
the commitment of every sincere sādhaka.
Ideally the sādhaka should also master Gauḍapāda’s Kārikās and 
Suresvara’s Vārtikā works plus Naishkarmya
Siddhi.

Sorry, here also you may hear the arguments from the scholars like : why 
we should restrict our studies to the works of ONLY vArtikakAra and his 
works??  why we should not refer other vyAkhyAna-s from bhAmati & vivaraNa 
& upavyAkhyAna-s on these vyAkhyAna,  since these works too are the 
contributions of saMpradAva vida-s and panchapAdika is ofcourse a work of 
direct disciple of shankara like sureshwara.  And when it comes to 
shankara's works, they would say that shankara along with upadesha sAhasri 
written the other important prakaraNa grantha-s like viveka chUdAmaNi, 
aparOkshAnubhuti etc. which has been considered as equally valid pramANa 
prakaraNa grantha-s within the tradition and for that matter for the 
viveka chUdAmaNi we have the commentary of H.H. Sri Sri Chandrashekhara 
bhArati mahAswaminaH.  So, siddhAnta presented in works like this should 
be in line with main prasthAna traya bhAshya of bhAshyakAra.  And it is 
the opinion of some scholars here that without these vyAkhyAna-s it is 
very difficult to understand the purports of certain adhikaraNa-s in sUtra 
bhAshya.  So, along with vArtika, kArika, NS etc. other works too have 
important role to play in arriving the shankara siddhAnta. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
