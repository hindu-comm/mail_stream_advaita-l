I went there with my son today morning hoping to listen to finer
points in advaita, but was told the meeting ended

yesterday because some of the scholars wanted to leave early.
Apparently, a summary of the topics discussed was presented

by Shri Advayananda Saraswati, after the sadas had ended. I was told
the topics discussed included suShupti, the role of Yoga in
advaita in the context of shravaNa, manana, and nididhyAsana.

Anand
