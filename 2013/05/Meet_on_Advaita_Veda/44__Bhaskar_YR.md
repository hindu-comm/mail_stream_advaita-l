praNAms Sri Anand Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I went there with my son today morning hoping to listen to finer
points in advaita, but was told the meeting ended yesterday because some 
of the scholars wanted to leave early.

>  thanks for the information prabhuji..when I went there around 11 AM, 
nobody was there!!


Apparently, a summary of the topics discussed was presented by Shri 
Advayananda Saraswati, after the sadas had ended. 

>  I think that must be an interesting summary.. Sri Subbu prabhuji may 
give us more details of it.  No need to mention here that Sri Advayananda 
Saraswati is from Mattur (purvAshrama Sri ChandramouLi Avadhani) younger 
brother of Sri Ashwatha Narayana Avadhani, a direct disciple of Sri SSS. 

I was told the topics discussed included suShupti, the role of Yoga in 
advaita in the context of shravaNa, manana, and nididhyAsana.

>  Very very interesting topics indeed...suShupti and its treatment in 
shankara bhAshya is always quite interesting, especially when it comes to 
kAraNAvidya in bhAvarUpa.  And the role of yOga as well in jnAna mArga 
sAdhana prakriya. 

>  Infact I went today with a question about jnAni's kAma krOdha 
(vipareeta pratyaya)  due to prArabdha/avidyAlesha which I was planning to 
ask if there is any leisure period or in  question & answer session :-) 
Anyway, I missed the opportunity. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
