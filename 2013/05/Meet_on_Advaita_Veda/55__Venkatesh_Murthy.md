'Tatha Ca Mithya Jnana Nimitto Loka Vyavaharaha Iti Yatha Shruta eva
Arthaha .

There is no difficulty, therefore, in taking the original 'Mithya Jnana
Nimittaha Loka Vyavahaaraha'  'human procedure in thinking and speaking in
the form 'me' and 'mine' is owing to misconception' at its face value, for
really there is no identity or real transference of properties. We shall
show how this is the plain meaning of this proposition presently in the
course of discussing the import of the next paras of the Bhashya'.

[[ You are seeing silver in shell. The shell is not same as silver. There
is not any transference of shell property to silver or silver property to
shell. Your misconception is the cause for seeing silver in shell. You
cannot say 'There is some Mulavidya causing silver appearance effect and I
am seeing the Silver because of Mulavidya'. It is simply your Misconception
and Mistake Or Your defective eyesight is causing this. That is why you are
seeing Silver. No use in blaming Mulavidya. There is no Mulavidya. ]]
