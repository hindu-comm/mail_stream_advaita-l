Om!

I read in the books of Swami Akandananda of Vrindavan that SaD vivarta vADa is the only possibility when the three sUktas nAsaDIya of Rigveda, sarvamEgha sUkta of Yajurveda, and ucchisTa sUkta of Atharva veda have to be reconciled.

Would someone have references and details on sarvamEgha sUkta of Yajurveda, and ucchisTa sUkta of Atharva veda

Om!

Srikrishna
