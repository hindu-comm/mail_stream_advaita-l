sarvamEgha?  I suspect that it is a typo for sarvamedha.  In the 
Shuklayajurveda the sarvamedhika mantras occur in the 32nd adhyAya 
(The sUkta beginning tadevAgnistadAditya... etc.)  I don't know where it 
is in krshnayajurveda.

the sarvamedha is a yajna in which all the major elements of srshti upto 
and including the yajamana himself are identified with the primordial 
purusha from whose division srshti occurred.  In that way it is similar 
to the more well-known puruSha sUkta (which is used in the similar 
purushamedha yajna)

I don't know about this ucchiSTa sukta but I expect the subject matter is 
similar.
