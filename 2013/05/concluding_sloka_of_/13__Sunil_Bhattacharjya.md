Namaste,

I think the book should be worth reading. In the following line from the preface Shri Sankaranarayanan seems to say that Adi Sankaracharya did not think Vedavyasa to be the author of the Brahmasutra.


Quote
The early Vedantin-s like Upavarsa and Sri Samkara held Badarayana to be the author of the 

Sariraka Brahma Sutra and considered him as different form Veda Vyasa.

Namaste 

Sankaranarayanan takes the view with textual evidence that the both Badarayana and Vyasa are different individuals. 

His paper was published as a book. Here is the link: http://www.exoticindia.com/book/details/badarayana-and-vyasa-as-authors-of-brahmasutra-historical-analysis-IDK561/
