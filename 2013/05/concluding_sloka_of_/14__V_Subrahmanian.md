There is a different reading of this part in my book:

samyak na sUtrairapi = samagrasUtrairapi.  Thus, the meaning is: Even
through/by the entire set of sutras Veda vyAsa  composed/collected the
purport (of the Vedanta) without remainder.

The 'siddhAntabinduTIkA' of Sri GauDabrahmAnanda saraswati says this on the
above verse:

sUtrairapivyAsaH sarvArthAn na babandha na sangRhItavAn,
shankarAcyaacaaryaastu sUtrANyanashrityApi sarvArthAn sangrahItavantaH
sUtra-anuktArthAnAmapi vaktRtvAdityarthaH.

Translation:  Even by / through the sutras vyAsaH did not  give the
complete aspects of the Vedanta.  On the other hand, Acharyas like Shankara
even without  resorting to the sutras collected all the aspects of the
Vedanta. This is because the works of Shankara and Sureshwara give
expression also to the aspects not stated by/in the sutras.
