Namaskaram. Do you have references to use of term mUlAvidyA by Sankara? And its parts - vidyA and avidyA? mAyA used in positive (daivim maya), neutral (trigunatmika maya) and negative (kutastha - kuta = crooked)connotations. avidyA is always negative. Is that right?

Shree Rajaram - PraNAms
In relation to muula avidya, yes; as I understand - That is what Subbuji has been presenting.
Hari Om!
