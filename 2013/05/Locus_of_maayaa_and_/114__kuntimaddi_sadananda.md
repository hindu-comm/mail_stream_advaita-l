Shree
Rajaram - PraNAms 
No. I do not have anything in
hand to provide for you. You can ignore my statements if you like and I have no
problem with that.
The others may be able to provide them for you if they wish. 
Just as a closing note, both positive and negative, whatever that mean, are
within avidyaa only since they are part of vyaavahaarika. vidyaa and avidyaa,
jnaani and ajnaani, etc are all within the realm of vyaavahaarika only; all
products of muula avidya. 
A jnaani will see the whole
creation as vibhhuti of the Lord or of his own self. yo maam pasyati
sarvatra... and sarva bhuutastam aatmaanam sarva bhuutani ca aatmani.. If that
is what you mean by positive that is OK. The vishepa aspect of muula avidya or maayaa
is still there but aavaraNa aspect is gone by vidyaa.
There
is a sloka in VivekachuuDamaNi that equates both maayaa and avidya.
It
starts with 
avyaktanaamnii
paramesha shakti, anaadyavidyaa triguNaatmikaa paraa|
kaaryaanumeya sudhiyaiva maayaa,
yayaa jagat sarvam idam prasuuyate|

I am quoting from memory, you need to
check if you are interested.

From paaramaarthika - it is sajaati, vijaati, swagata bheda rahitam - hence neither jiiva nor Iswara or the world of plurality- positive and/or negative. na vaak gacchati na manaH .. 
Hope this helps.

Hari Om!
Sadananda

>Namaskaram. Do you have references to use of term mUlAvidyA by Sankara? And its parts - vidyA and avidyA? mAyA used in positive (daivim maya), neutral (trigunatmika maya) and negative (kutastha - kuta = crooked)connotations. avidyA is always negative. Is that right?
