I don't know which of vyAkhyAnakAra-s is being talked here. At least, none 
from traditional-s talked like that.

>  if memory serves me right, panchapAdika vyAkhyAnakAra in vivaraNa says 
there exists some anirvachaneeya and anAdi avidyA in Atma chaitanya. Since 
this avidyA is dependent on anAdi chaitanyasatta this avidyA too anAdi, 
since it is neither sat nor asat it is anirvachaneeya.  And I think here 
in this work only it has been said that avidyA does not mean an abhAva of 
the nature of not knowing (agrahaNa or jnAnAbhAva), nor it is a nature of 
wrong knowledge ( mithyAjnAna or vipareeta grahaNa or anyathAgrahaNa) nor 
it is samskAra rUpa..exact references I cannot give right now...But I have 
read this in panchapAdika vivaraNa works.

You are saying that avidyA is not anirvachanIyA. But, that's not correct. 
Every vyAkhyAnakAra supports it's anirvachanIyatvam, otherwise it would be 
real. 

>  I dont think shankara anywhere says avidyA is anirvachaneeya..geeta 
bhAshya he counts the avidyA lakshaNa and says it will be of three types 
i.e. agrahaNa, anyathAgrahaNa and saMshaya and in adhyAsa bhAshya too 
shankara says avidyA/adhyAsa is naisargika lOkavyavahAra.  If it is 
anirvachaneeya ( shankara actually talks about anirvachaneeyatvaM about 
avidyA kalpita mAya) shankara would have addressed this in adhyAsa bhAshya 
which is exclusively dedicated to deal with this particular subject 
matter.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
