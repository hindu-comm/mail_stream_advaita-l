Subbuji - PraNAms
Just
a point of clarification from my understanding. First, I changed the title since
the topic is more on the locus of avidya and maayaa. 
Second, since there is nothing
other than Brahman, locus for anything cannot but be Brahman. At the same time,
Brahman being infiniteness cannot be locus for anything.
Hence the whole discussion of the
existence of maayaa and avidyaa are in the realm of vyavahaara only. However,
vyavahaara itself is product of maayaa from the point of Iswara and avidya from
the point of jiiva. Personally I prefer the use of maayaa at Iswara level and
avidyaa at the jiiva level for one important reason. We need to distinguish Iswara
sRishTi and jiiva sRishTi - a macro and micro levels of creation as part of understanding
vyaavahaarika, praatibhaasika and paaramaarthika levels. These aspects are
clearas stated inManDukya mantras where the micro and macro levels are
clearly specified. 
Even though the distinction of
Jiiva and Iswara in terms of upaadhi bhedas is clear - the term used for both is
just - upavishati - as though Brahman enters - either at macro level or micro
level is to be understood. Without compromising the sarvajnatvam of Iswara, it
is important to differentiate the maayaa as the locus of Iswara and avidya
locus of jiiva since it is the mind of the jiiva that is deluded but not the
mind of Iswara. Hence self-realization or jnaanam occurs at the level of
jiiva's mind and is not needed at Iswara's level. The realization at Jiiva level
also occurs as Upahita chaitanyam, where the upaadhi is his own BMI - it involves destruction of avidyaa but not destruction
of maayaa which is at Iswara level. Hence as we saw extended discussions in the
other list, there isa significantconfusion in terms of misunderstanding of destruction of the whole
creation saying that jnaani does not have BMI and has no perception of the
world of plurality, when Jiiva attains self-realization. This problem seems to be somewhat deep-rooted as we see here as well as in the other lists due to some incorrect interpretations that were passed on. 
If we say jiiiva is product of
avidya and at the same time jiiva is the locus of avidyaa - there is obviously
anyonya aashraya - which Bhagavan Ramanuja criticizes in his seven untenables
against avidyaa of Advaita in his Shree Bhaashya; but this can be dismissed as
anirvacaniiya similar to seed and the tree case - in the cyclic process one cannothave a clearcause-effect relationships. It can only be called as anirvacaniiyam - the verybasis formithyaa too.
In essence, I feel it is more
clearly understood if one uses avidyaa at the jiiva level and maayaa at the
Iswara level; although it is muula avidyaa as the primordial cause for
creation. Most of the confusion, here and elsewhere (in terms of what is the
status of jiiva mukta) is due to this confusion of the terms of avidyaa vs
maayaa.
My 2 cents.
Hari Om!
