Namaste

Holenarsipur Swamiji has said in page 78 - 'Maayaa Sabdaha Na Kvacidapi
Bhashye Avidyaaparyaayatvena Nirdishtaha Yathaa Manyate Teekaakaaraha' No
where in the Bhashya Adi Sankara has said Maya is same as Avidya like the
Teekaakaara is thinking.

Who is Ishwara? What is Ishwara's Maayaa? Who is Jeeva?  All this is Avidya
Kalpita. Ishwara and the Maya and Jeeva are all Avidya Kalpita only. They
are CONJURED UP by Avidya. What is Avidyaa? It is Adhyaasa only.

Avidyaa = Adhyaasa . This is a simple point not understood by many people.
Adi Sankara has said -

Tametamevam Lakshanam Adhyaasam Panditaa Avidyeti Manyante. The wise people
think the Superimposition is Avidyaa. There is  not some other Avidyaa
Sakti sitting behind Adhyaasa and causing it.

If Adhyaasa is understood we can understand Ishwara and his Maya Sakti or
Prakruti are CONJURED UP by Adhyaasa. Why? Because I have Adhyaasa of Body
and Mind in Atma I imagine I am a Jeeva and there must be a Ishwara. I
imagine His power. I imagine Ishwara has created this World. I imagine I am
a Jeeva and go from one birth to next. Even Sastra is saying I have to do
good acts for better birth and avoid bad acts. I imagine I am a
transmigrating Soul. But this is all because of Adhyaasa. It is all Avidyaa
Kalpita.

Sutra Bhashya 2 -1 - 14 Avidyaakalpite Naama Roope Tattvaanyatvaabhyaam
Anirvacaneeye Samsaaraprapanceebhoote Sarvajnasya Ishwarasya Maayaa Saktihi
Prakrutiriti Sruti Smrutyorabhilapyete
'Name and Form which constitute the seed of the world of mundane life
CONJURED UP BY AVIDYA as though they were identical with the Omniscient
Lord but which are Undefinable as Reality or other than That are called
'Maya', Sakti (potential energy), and Prakrti (primordial matter) in the
Sruti and Smruti.

'Whereas it has been proclaimed in the Bhashya that name and form CONJURED
UP BY AVIDYA are called Maya the author of the Tika has maintained that the
Avidya Sakti is itself the Maya and that Akasha etc are all names of that
hypothetical Avidya Sakti'. - Page 34

Very Important statement from Adi Sankara in Adhyasa Bhashya - Tametam
Avidyaakhyam Atmaanaatmanor Itaretara Adhyaasam Puraskrutya Sarve Pramaana
Prameya Vyavahaaraa Laukikaa Vaidikaashca Pravruttaaha

All worldly and Vaidika activities are based on this Superimposition of Not
Self and Self on each other. This Superimposition is Avidyaa the Ignorance.

In the Sutra Bhashya you have given अविद्यात्मिका हि
बीजशक्तिरव्यक्तशब्दनिर्देश्या परमेश्वराश्रया मायामयी, the Holenarsipur
Swamiji is saying we have say अविद्यात्मिका is अविद्याकल्पिता only. Maayaa
is CONJURED UP BY Avidyaa.
