Namaste

Sankara Vedanta is saying Avidya is natural for men. Naisargika. The Avidya
is nothing but Adhyaasa. This is Superimposition of Self and not Self. The
Avidyaa is making us to imagine a Ishwara and His Maayaa Shakti. The Maayaa
Shakti is the cause of the World. This means the whole World is imagined
through Adhyaasa.

Summary - Adi Sankara is saying Adhyaasa is responsible for Maayaa. Maaya
is Avidyaa Kalpitaa. Imagined through Ignorance. But Post Sankara
sub-commentators are saying Avidyaa and Maayaa are both same.

Good and Bad parts of Maayaa are both imagined only. They are False.
