Holenarsipur Swamiji is saying there is no where in Sankara Bhashya any
scope for a OBJECTIVE Avidya like the Teekaakaaras are saying. The Avidyaa
is only Adhyaasa that is Misconception in the mind of human beings. This
Misconception Avidyaa is natural and a basic instinct for human beings.
Every man has the basic instinct 'Adhyaasa'. He thinks I am body and this
thing is mine. Ahamidam and Mamedam. A man with Misconception will imagine
so many things. He will imagine Ishwara and his Maya Sakti also. He can
imagine the  Avyakta Beeja Sakti also because Sastra is saying that. The
Sastra is also because of Adhyaasa only.The Beeja Sakti Avastha is also
there because it is imagined by Misconception. It is Avidyaa Kalpitaa only.
If someone says the Beeja Sakti Avastha is Moola Avidyaa it is not correct
because that is imagined by Adhyaasa that is Avidyaa. How can it be Moola
Avidyaa?

'It is a natural human procedure' Naisargiko Ayam Loka Vyavahaaraha means
that the nature of the human mind is such that in their unreflecting
condition men instinctively behave in a manner quite opposed to reason'.

Very important words in Adhyaasa Bhaashya are 'Mithyaa Jnaana Nimittaha
Satyaanrute Mithuneekrutya Ahamidam Mamedamiti Naisargiko Ayam Loka
Vyavahaaraha'

In page 14 Sankara Vedanta Meemamsa Bhashya Swamiji has said -

'Owing to a Misconception' Mithya Jnana Nimitta is for explaining why the
procedure is 'natural' or Naisargika. Misconceptions unlike right knowledge
are quite natural to mankind. Right knowledge, on the other hand, is
adventitious for it flashes only to only those whose mind is saturated with
Sastric knowledge. Human mind by virtue of its natural inclination is
liable to mix up both the real Self and the unreal not Self and
instinctively thinks in the form 'I am this' 'This is mine'. Here the word
'I' refers to the real Self whereas 'this' corresponds to the not Self such
as the body. Man rarely suspects that this 'me' includes the real as well
as the not self, body etc. And this is mine refers to everything that is
other than the Self including the mind, senses and the body etc'.

Liberation comes when the Misconception Adhyaasa is removed. The potential
power is also imagined only because of Adhyaasa.

How it is wrong I would like to know.

Liberation is from burning Adhyaasa. Because when Adhyaasa that is Avidyaa
is burned the Avidyaa Kalpita Maayaa Sakti is also burned. Maaya Sakti is
imagined because of Adhyaasa.If Adhyaasa is not there what can he imagine?
All the imaginations are burned.
