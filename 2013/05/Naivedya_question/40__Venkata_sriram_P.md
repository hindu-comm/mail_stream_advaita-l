Kindly clarity whether all these referred above are in the domain of
"ADHYASA?

>From vedanta perspective, yes, clinging to rituals is also a vAsana.

Sri Vidyaranya in Jivamukti Viveka mentions that among the 3 categories of shAstra-vAsana, the 3rd one is giving excessive importance to karma kANDa, rituals & AchAra. 

In a long run, this becomes a pratibandhaka to take sarva-karma-sanyAsa.

sriram
