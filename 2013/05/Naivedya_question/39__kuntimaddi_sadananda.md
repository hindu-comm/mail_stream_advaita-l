Subrahmanaya UH ji- My PraNAms
My salutations to you ifyou think that you are not the body and you are notdoing anything, including asking the question on Naivedya. 

Yes all these that are being referred are in the domain of Adhyaasa. From paaramaarthika point no questions can be asked or need to be asked including the question on Naivedya. Jaaniis understand that the whole thing is adhyaasa can do naivedyam too without doing it - inaction in action - saH buddhimaan manushyeShu. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda
