I have read only a few verses here and there. I would like to read all the verses and more importantly the commentaries on it but I am not sure how to get hold of at least one of the commentaries. It could be that intially the Shataka highlights the romantic dreamy aspects and then gradually leads the reader to the sorrowful aspects when the romance ends and it dawns on the romantic pair that all these carnal pleasures are temporary and thus prepares them for the spiritual journey. May be we have among us scholars, who have looked for the spiritual message in that.

It is a collection of verses in shrngara rasa.

An enterprising interpreter can find all kinds of meanings in things but I 
am rather dubious about any "Advaitic message" in the Amarushataka. Have 
you read it?

 One poem of Adi Shankara's “Amarushataka” is inscribed on

Note the story of Shankaracharya being temporarily confounded by Mandan 
Mishra's wife Bharati asking questions on kamashastra during their debate 
and requesting an adjounment during which he inhabited the body of the 
recently deceased King Amaru (or Amaruka) is first found in the 
14th century Madhaviya Shankara digvijaya. Earlier mentions of the 
Amarushataka (several kavyashastras use verses from it as examples) are 
silent on this topic. So I think you are getting way ahead of yourself in 
your analysis of the Nagarjunakonda inscription. More context is needed.
