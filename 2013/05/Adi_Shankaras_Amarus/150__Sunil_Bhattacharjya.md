Dear friends,

I understand that Adi Shankara's Amarushataka is essentially a deep Advaitic text and Appaya dikshita
had commented on a verse of this. The
commentator Ravichandra is said to have written in his commentary that
that the verses of Amarushataka have double meanings but their
real import is philosophical. It will be nice to hear from the
learnedmembers if any study had been
carried out on the Advaitc message in the Amarushataka. One
poem of Adi Shankara's “Amarushataka”  is inscribed on a ‘Stupa’
(Pillar) at Nagarjunakonda in AndhraPradesh.This stupa can be said
to be athree  
dimensional
representation of the Amarushataka. This show that even the Buddhists
of his timewere
influenced by his Advaita philosophy. This inscription probably also
throws some light on the times  of Adi Shankara, albeit indirectly.

Regards,
Sunil
