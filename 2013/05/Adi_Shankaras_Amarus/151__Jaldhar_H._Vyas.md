It is a collection of verses in shrngara rasa.

An enterprising interpreter can find all kinds of meanings in things but I 
am rather dubious about any "Advaitic message" in the Amarushataka.  Have 
you read it?

  One poem of Adi Shankara's “Amarushataka” is inscribed on

Note the story of Shankaracharya being temporarily confounded by Mandan 
Mishra's wife Bharati asking questions on kamashastra during their debate 
and requesting an adjounment during which he inhabited the body of the 
recently deceased King Amaru (or Amaruka) is first found in the 
14th century Madhaviya Shankara digvijaya.  Earlier mentions of the 
Amarushataka (several kavyashastras use verses from it as examples) are 
silent on this topic.  So I think you are getting way ahead of yourself in 
your analysis of the Nagarjunakonda inscription.  More context is needed.
