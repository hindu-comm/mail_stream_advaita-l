Pranam to all,

During the Upanayana, the vatu begs for alms from female relatives "bhavati bhikshan dEhi". My understanding is that dEhi is an imperative: you give, to be used for familiar/informal "you".

e.g.
1.Skt: tvam dEhi
2.Hin: tum dO
3.Kan:; Neenu koDu

Hence, is it grammatical correct for the vatu to state: " bhavati bhikshan dadhatu " ?
