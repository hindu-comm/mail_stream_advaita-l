PraNAms 
The question itself is self-contradictory, since jiiva mukta means he is liberated even though due to praarabda the BMI continues and he has understood He is the totality not the local BMI. For him there is no Iswara separate from him since he is muktah - free from all limitations. It involves non-negatable understanding that aham brahma asmi and therefore the jagat is mithyaa. Any statement in the scriptures related to Jiivan mukta have to be appropriately interpreted. 
yat gatvaa na nivartante tad dhaama paramam mama. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda

>Hare Krishna. What is the sastra (shruti) pramana that a jIvan muktA will not become bound again whatever he does after self-realisation due to prarabda and purva karma vasana? I found the following smrti verse, which says that a jivan mukta will become bound by karma if he offends the lord!
