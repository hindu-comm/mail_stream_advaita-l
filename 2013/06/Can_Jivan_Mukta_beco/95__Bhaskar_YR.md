praNAms Sri Sadananda prabhuji
Hare Krishna

The question itself is self-contradictory, since jiiva mukta means he is 
liberated even though due to praarabda the BMI continues and he has 
understood He is the totality not the local BMI. 

>  But crux of the issue here is though he has the realization of totality 
he continues to have this 'totality knowledge' in his 'local' BMI till the 
death of his physical body.  So, till the death of the bhautika shareera 
his 'local BMI' and the custodian of this local BMI i.e. jnAni would 
continue to have the influence (bad or good) of prArabdha and avidyA lesha 
and resultant rAga-dvesha...So, question is not self contradictory since 
we are 'seeing' the living jeevan mukta & there is a mention of 
rAga-dvesha in jnAni in some prakaraNa grantha-s like JMV (which Sri Subbu 
prabhuji just now aptly quoted)  :-))

For him there is no Iswara separate from him since he is muktah - free 
from all limitations. 

>  not totally free from all limitations as long as he is alive in 
shareera since he would be  facing  the music of prArabdha and traces of 
avidyA. 

It involves non-negatable understanding that aham brahma asmi and 
therefore the jagat is mithyaa. 

>  there is an occasional slip to this jnAna also...dvichandra darshana & 
'digbhrAnta', vipareeta pratyaya to jnAni,  are the examples that we can 
pick from shankara bhAshya itself :-))

Any statement in the scriptures related to Jiivan mukta have to be 
appropriately interpreted. 

>  In what way could you please elaborate it??

yat gatvaa na nivartante tad dhaama paramam mama. 

> paramam padaM can be reached ONLY after shareera tyAga not before.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
