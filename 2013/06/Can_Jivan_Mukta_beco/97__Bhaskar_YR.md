praNAms Sri Sadananda prabhuji
Hare Krishna

The difference between Jnaani and jnaana nishTa - has to be understood
 as been explained by Subbuji also in many of his mails. Jiivan muktaH 
by definition is jnaana nishTa. Ramana calls it as dRiDaiva niShTaa or 
Krishna calls it as Sthita prajnaH. The remnant or lingering raaga 
dweshaas are for the one who has not jnaana niShTa.

>  I am surprised to see the 'silence' of Sri subbu prabhuji here!! 
Ofcourse, he has the rights to chose what to reply & what not...But here I 
think his response is required.  All these days Sri subbu prabhuji has 
been arguing that irrespective of status of jnAni ( whether he is kevala 
jnAni mAtra or jnAna nishTa or brahmavidvarishTa immaterial) each and 
every type of jnAni is subject to kAma krOdha since these are the products 
of that dreaded prArabdha karma and nobody can escapte from this prArabdha 
karma phala.  Nowhere Sri Subbu prabhuji said ONLY jnAna nishTa-s are free 
from this prArabdha karma and resultant kAma-krOdha, OTOH, he is quoting 
profusely from the prakaraNa grantha-s like JMV (jeevan mukti viveka), 
panchadashi etc.  to prove his point that even paramArtha jnAna nishTa-s 
are not free from kAma krOdha, vipareeta pratyaya etc.  It is in this 
spirit only he has given the examples of sages like Sri RamaNa, 
rAmakrishna paramahaMsa etc.  Though he said that there is no rebirth due 
to this likes & dislikes (kAma & krOdha) after death of the physical 
bodies of these jnAni-s, it is inevitable that jnAni / jnAnanishTa has to 
experience these tribulations due to his prArabdha or avidyAlesha.. But on 
the contrary to these statements, Sri shankara is quite clear that 
tattvamasi type of realization is here and NOW and not shareerapAtOttara 
kAlaM, na hi tattvamasi ityasya vAkyasya arthaH 'tattvaM mrutO 
bhavishyasi' ityevaM pariNeruM shkyaH...shankara in sUtra bhAshya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
