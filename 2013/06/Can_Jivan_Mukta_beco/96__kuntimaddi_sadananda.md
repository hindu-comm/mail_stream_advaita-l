>The question itself is self-contradictory, since jiiva mukta means he is
liberated even though due to praarabda the BMI continues and he has understood
He is the totality not the local BMI.
>
>> But crux of the issue here is though he
has the realization of totality he continues to have this 'totality knowledge'
in his 'local' BMI till the death of his physical body. So, till
the death of the bhautika shareera his 'local BMI' and the custodian of
this local BMI i.e. jnAni would continue to have the influence (bad or
good) of prArabdha and avidyA lesha and resultant rAga-dvesha...So, question
is not self contradictory since we are 'seeing' the living jeevan mukta
& there is a mention of rAga-dvesha in jnAni in some prakaraNa grantha-s
like JMV (which Sri Subbu prabhuji just now aptly quoted) :-))

 -The difference between Jnaani and jnaana nishTa - has to be understood
 as been explained by Subbuji also in many of his mails. Jiivan muktaH 
by definition is jnaana nishTa. Ramana calls it as dRiDaiva niShTaa or 
Krishna calls it as Sthita prajnaH. The remnant or lingering raaga 
dweshaas are for the one who has not jnaana niShTa. Even for jnaani also
 there is no sanchita and aagami karmas for him to be born again. Hence 
what is quoted has to be applied in self-consistent way - tat tu 
samanvayaat!

limitations as long as he is alive in shareera since he would be facing
the music of prArabdha and traces of avidyA.

brahma asmi and therefore the jagat is mithyaa.

>> there is an occasional slip to this jnAna
also...dvichandra darshana & 'digbhrAnta', vipareeta pratyaya to jnAni,
are the examples that we can pick from shankara bhAshya itself :-))

mukta have to be appropriately interpreted.

>> In what way could you please elaborate
it?? 

-----------------

Bhaskarji
 - In the above way! The difference between jnaani and jnaanai nishTaa 
or jiivan mukta is that for jnaani there are only the remnant vaasanaas 
or not having fully the complete chitta suddhi. For him only 
nidhidhyaasana is prescribed. In Naiskarmya Siddhi, Sureswara has 
elaborately discussed to whom nidhidhdyaasana is required after 
shrotavyaH and mantavyaH.

>> paramam padaM can be reached ONLY
after shareera tyAga not before.
-----------------

Bhaskarji
 - Yes it is reached once one has understood that I am not this body but
 I pervade this and as well as other bodies as adhiShTaanam. He has 
already given up the notion that I am this body - that is shareera 
tyaga, while still being as upahita chaitanya. That is also the meaning 
of tayagenaike amRitatvamanasuH. 


The videha mukti is 
desolation of even praarabda karma since the BMI is originated by that. 
This aspect was discussed in the Maitreyii brahmana in the 12th mantra 
using salt crystal example.
