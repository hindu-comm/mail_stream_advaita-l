The j√©vanmuktas again become bound by karma if they commit offense to 
theLord, possessor of inconceivably great energies

praNams Sri Rajaram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

As far as my knowledge goes, there is no difference as such between the 
'will' of jeevan mukta & Ishwara.  Hence there does not exist any 
offensive work by the jeevan mukta...He is akatru, abhOktru (trishwapi 
kAleshu) and he is krutakrutya. 

But as per the latest trend, jeevan mukta is occasionally  subject to 
kAma-krOdha due to prArabdha / avidyAlesha but I dont know whether this 
would lead him to the activities that Ishwara think offensive :-)) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
