satva guNAs and amAnitvAdi lakSaNAs are achieved through"Ishwara praNIdhAna". How can a jeevanmukta do apachAra to such an Ishwara?

sri sureshwara in naishkarmya siddhi says that even the mumukSu cannot think of 
svEcchAchAra then what to speak of a jnAni. 

Humility becomes the alamkAra to a jnAni therefore one can't think of such an act by him.

regs,
sriram
