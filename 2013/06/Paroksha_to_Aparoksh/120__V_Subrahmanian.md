This satyatvam is only upon negating the nAmarUpa dvandva, kriya, kAraka,
etc. The basis for this is mRttiketyEva satyam, vAchArambhaNam nAmadheyam.
It does not answer the question above.

Why should I make any efforts to 'bring in' saguNa brahman; the bhAShya is
replete with references to saguNa brahman (eg. the third adhyAya and fourth
adhyAya of the brahmasutra).

Simple; it is adhyasta in the substratum brahman.  The adhyAsa bhAshya
emphatically  says:

*//tatraivam sati yatra yadadhyAsaH, tatkRtena doSheNa guNena vaa
aNumAtreNApi sa na sambadhyate…// [‘This being so, the locus
(Atman/Brahman) is not affected in any way either by the merits or demerits
of the things superimposed.’]

sarvAtmabhAva is for his anusandhAna and the Atmapratipatti.  But his
vyavahAra will not be possible with that bhAva.  So, the dehAdi will have
to be used by him for vyavahAra.  He can't go to bhikShA with the
sarvAtmabhAva knowledge.  Unless kalpita, buddhipUrvaka bheda is employed
by him no vyavahAra will take place.  When Shankara averred 'ato jyeShAmi
sarvAn' ('Therefore, I shall conquer all') in the Taittiriya bhashya, he
'sarvAn' are all those opponents to Advaita/vedanta dharshana.  With just
sarvAtmabhAva no debate or disputation will be possible.  Only samAdhi will
be possible.

No. TattvadarshI of the 2.16 is not a sAdhaka.

Then Shankara is also an ajnAni. The Upanishads talk of the death of the
jnani.  Is it ajnAni?

The objection applies to Shankara and the upanishads.

The above is not the correct depiction/understanding of the sAkshi of the
Vedanta.  The bhAShya vAkya you cited is about the entertaining of notion
of real difference.  But the jnAni's vyavahAra is based on kalpita
vyavahAra.  Otherwise the jnani acharya can't even teach the disciple.
