So, mauna lakSaNa is the guNa of true jnAni. 

praNAms
Hare Krishna

this also reminds me the dakshiNAmurthy stOtra, gurOstu mouna vyAkhyAnaM 
shishyAstu chinna saMshayaH...but the question is how capable we are, with 
our conditioned mind to understand this sublime silence of the jnAni??  I 
wonder if at all there is absolute silence from the sages like ramaNa, it 
would have been difficult  to recognize him as a paramArtha jnAni....I 
think amidst thick silence of jnAni-s, there needs to be sporadic talks 
from them, otherwise it would be difficult for us to make out the 
difference between ajnAni's mouna due to ignorance  and jnAni's serene 
mouna, which is the result of ekatva jnAna.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
