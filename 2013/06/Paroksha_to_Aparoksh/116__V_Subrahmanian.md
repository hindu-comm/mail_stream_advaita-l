Sri Vidyaranya (I think) has said in the Panchadashi that certain things
like the presence of jnAna, ajnAna, hunger, thirst, joy, sorrow in oneself
are all directly known (aparokSha) to oneself (and not to others).  For
others it is only inferentially (parokSha) known.

Having said this, there is an episode in the Mahabharatha where a bhikShukI
named 'sulabhA' (Shankara refers to her in the BSB) shAntiparvan
(MokShadharma)  12-320-7 onwards therein where she engages a king who
thought he was enlightened and finally establishes the contrary.
