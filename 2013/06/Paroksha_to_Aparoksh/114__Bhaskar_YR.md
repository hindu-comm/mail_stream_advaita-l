So, mouna is not put blank faces and staring at guru.  This is not the 
method of learning.

praNAms Sri Sriram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes, this is what I meant too, guru's mouna here is not wearing the 
graphite face and staring at shishya..A shrotreeya, brahmanishTa guru has 
to sometimes vocally describe the 'real' meaning of this mouna, then only 
aviveki-s like me would understand what is the 'mouna' of the guru!!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
