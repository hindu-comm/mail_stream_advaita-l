Namaste,

//
I wonder if at all there is absolute silence from the sages like ramaNa
//

1) mounaM charati iti muniH 
2) mananAt muniH uchyatE
3) mounaM mantrArtha chintanaM

So, mouna is muni-lakSaNa; then what is mouna? The answer is obvious that
it is nirantara-manana lakSaNa of muni. So, mouna is not put blank faces and staring at guru. This is not the method of learning.

It is "taila-dhArAvat upaniSad mantrArtha chintanaM" which results in nidhidhyAsana. This teaching was imparted through chinmudra of dakshinamurty. The crux is to understand
this mudra and hence Sankara says "bhadrayA mudrayA".

regs,
sriram
