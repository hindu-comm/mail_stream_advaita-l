In this case the burden of proof lies on them, not on us.  To deny what
they propose does not require proof by us.  For us anupalabdhi in our works
is enough to deny their claims.

Also, I have a question on the 'chiranjeevi' status:  Is it not that the
entity is awarded the chiranjeevi status after his current birth? Does this
status go back to all his previous births too? I do not think so.  Also I
recently heard in a discourse that 'chiranjeevi' lasts only till this kalpa
and not beyond.
