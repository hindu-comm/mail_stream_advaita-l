Humble sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Apart from four possibilities, the 5th definite possibility according to 
Kriya yOga traditionalists, who want to drag bhagavatpAda in their fold, 
is that bAbAji is chiranjeevi, like hanumAn, markandeya etc. and ever 
youth (always in twenties).  So bAbAji in 8th century has instructed the 
kriya yOga to shankara bhagavatpAda.  Ofcourse, one can validly  infer 
that shankara might have learnt some yOga techniques from a yOga teacher 
as he has shown some miracles like vajrOli mudra, parakAya pravesha etc. 
There is no mention of yOga teacher from whom shankara learnt these yOga 
tricks in mAdhaveeya.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
