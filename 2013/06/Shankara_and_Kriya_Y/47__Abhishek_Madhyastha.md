Namaste,

In all this discussion about someone teaching Adi Shankaracharya about
Kriya aren't we forgetting a very important fact that Adi Shankara IS
LORD SHIVA? Doesn't this very fact count for a lot of exceptions? Is
it really necessary for someone to teach the Lord?
If Shankara as a mere boy could invoke goddess Lakshmi with his
prayers & without the help of a really advanced Guru, why is it that
he can not get Yoga siddhi if not from babaji? Can the fact that
Shankaracharya is the very incarnation of Parameshwara be taken so
very lightly?
Then again, we also know that Adi Shankara ascended the Sarvajna
peetha which requires him to be a Sarvajna & that he should be a
master of all 64 vidyas. Shall we go about searching if there's
another babaji who taught him these vidyas?
The fact that he is the incarnation of Lord Shiva simply makes him a
huge exception in many ways & he in no way can be treated in
comparison to any other sanyasin, no matter how great & advanced the
latter may be.

Secondly, don't you think we're taking the Guru Parampara of
Bhagavatpada for granted? His parampara certainly no ordinary one! I
think most of the list members will know the story of Gaudapadacharya
in his purvashrama being the disciple of Patanjali & how he was
Patanjali's favorite,etc. Patanjali was a master of yoga. That's not
the only point. Even the Guru parampara before Gaudapadacharya
contains the names of several stalwarts who are by no means ordinary
people.
When Gaudapadacharya can appear in front of Shankaracharya(the
incident where acharya shows the Mandukya Karika), why is it that the
Gurus preceding Gaudapadacharya too might have taught him? Shuka,
Vyasa, Parashara, Shakti,etc & even Lord Brahma & Lord Vishnu are of
this parampara.
Why is it that babaji is required to teach someone from such a
magnificent Parampara? Won't the Gurus of the entire parampara help
anyone coming down in this parampara? Isn't it this very unbroken
parampara that's the reason for Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji to
experience such extraordinary feats?! Would this have been possible if
not for the grace of Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamiji?
When such is the case, what can we say about someone in this parampara
who is the incarnation of the Lord himself?

To simply make claims that babaji taught kriya yoga to Adi
Shankaracharya without substantial proof/record like Rajaramji has
pointed out, is quite silly & personally I feel its blasphemy towards
acharya & insult to the divine Guru Parampara!

Regards,
Abhishek Madhyastha
