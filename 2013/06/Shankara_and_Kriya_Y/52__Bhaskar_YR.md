The 'Teacher' can appear in any form.  One's own intuitive capacity can
very well be a teacher.

Yes, teacher can come and teach his pupil in any form...Perhaps, that 
would be the reason to believe that shankara has been taught kriya yOga by 
bAbAji.  Since we donot know anything about it certainly as idamittaM, 
like your assumption that there is no need for guru to master siddhi-s, 
they (the kriya yOga followers) can also assume that shankara's guru is 
indeed bAbAji :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
