praNAms Sri Sunil prabhuji
hare Krishna

Sorry, I should have more deplomatically said yOga siddhi-s instead of 
yOga tricks..Anyway, name it whatever way, there is no doubt that these 
siddhi-s are the phala-s (fruits) of yOgAbhyAsa.  I think vajrOli mudra 
comes under haTha yOga prakriya...But fact remains that according to 
mAdhaveeya,  shankara had learnt these kriya-s and mastered the 'siddhi-s 
like parakAya pravesha etc. But from whom he learnt all these things?? is 
still a question..to fill this dotted lines, kriya yOgins might say it is 
bAbAji, founder kriya yOga has taught these kriya-s to shankara. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

Namaste,

Those are not called Yogatricks. They have a respectable name 
"Yoga-siddhis". These include siddhis such as  Anima, Garima, Laghima and 
others. Lord Dattatreya, one of the avataras of Lord Vishnu,  had given 
all these details in his yoga text.

Humble sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Apart from four possibilities, the 5th definite possibility according to 
Kriya yOga traditionalists, who want to drag bhagavatpAda in their fold, 
is that bAbAji is chiranjeevi, like hanumAn, markandeya etc. and ever 
youth (always in twenties).  So bAbAji in 8th century has instructed the 
kriya yOga to shankara bhagavatpAda.  Ofcourse, one can validly  infer 
that shankara might have learnt some yOga techniques from a yOga teacher 
as he has shown some miracles like vajrOli mudra, parakAya pravesha etc. 
There is no mention of yoga teacher from whom shankara learnt these yOga 
tricks in mAdhaveeya.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
