We must remember that such accomplishment is a result of anushThAna.  Then
he  can take the special benefit.  In the toTakAchARya episode, just out 
of
sincere devotion to Shankara, he was blessed with the supreme knowledge.

I am not able to go down to the mailing list and reply to your y'day's 
mail on sushupti due to continuous flow of today's mails on bAbAji and 
kriyAyOga : -))  Anyway, I don't think anywhere shankara says that the 
guru is not necessary for the uttamAdhikAri of the jnAna & for the 
uttamAdhikAra shAstra is not the ONLY pramANa.  Ofcourse, we do have some 
exceptional cases like ramaNa, kAlidAsa ( who overnight become a Sanskrit 
scholar/poet by the grace of kAli mAta...BTW, I donot know the real story 
of kAlidAsa, I am making this statement after watching Dr. Rajkumar starer 
Kannada movie  'kaviratna kAlidAsa' in 1990's :-)) But these exceptional 
cases would not become a general rule to declare that ' for an 
uttamAdhikAri anything will do' :-))  In the totakAchArya episode also we 
have the physical presence of the guru in the form of shankarachArya. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
