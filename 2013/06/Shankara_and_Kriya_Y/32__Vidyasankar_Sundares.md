Uncharitable explanation: This is a totally untenable story, as the Mahavatar
Babaji could not have lived for twelve or more centuries.



Charitable explanation: This is just a story meant to praise the Babaji, along
the lines of standard myth making in India.



Historical explanation: Perhaps some titular Sankaracharya from about 150
years ago in north India had taken some Yoga initiation from the Babaji. It
is easy to understand how this may have come to be attributed to Adi
Sankara. These things happen all the time.



Esoteric interpretation: A past-life memory? 



One can take one's pick! The problem is that many arbitrary stories are in
circulation about Adi Sankaracharya, floated by the multitudes of smaller
and larger monastic and ascetic sampradAyas in India.

Not specifically the particular kind of kriyA yoga that comes through Lahiri
Mahasaya, but taking the pAtanjala yogasUtra definition of kriyA yoga as
tapas, svAdhyaya and ISvara-praNidhAna, there is much in the bhAshyas
on these aspects.
