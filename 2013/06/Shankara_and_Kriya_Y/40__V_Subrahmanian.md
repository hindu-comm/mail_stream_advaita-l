Shankara has said in the BSB: syAt parameshwarasyApi mAyAmayarUpagrahaNam
sAdhakAnugrahArtham.  [it is possible that the Lord takes a form that is a
mAyic one for the sake of blessing an aspirant.  We have the famous episode
in the Chandogya upanishad where the brahmachAri assigned to take care of
the cows of his guru returning an enlightened one being taught by the
various devatA-s.  His Acharya, surprised, asks him who taught him and he
explains.  In this story, though, he gets instructed by his Acharya once
again, to conform to the norm.

We must remember that such accomplishment is a result of anushThAna.  Then
he  can take the special benefit.  In the toTakAchARya episode, just out of
sincere devotion to Shankara, he was blessed with the supreme knowledge.
