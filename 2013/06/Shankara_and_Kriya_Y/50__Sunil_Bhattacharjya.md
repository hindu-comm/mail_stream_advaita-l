Namaste,

Since this is an upama, could this also not mean that Adi Shankara was a Jnani of the highest order and even comparable to Lord Shiva ?

Regards,

While Shankara Himself has not claimed this, Padmapada in his PanchapAdikA takes the name of vinAyaka, if not in prayer, in extolling Shankara:

vinA vinAyakam apUrva-shankaram (the last line of the third verse at the commencement of the panchapAdikA)


Bhagavatpaada Shankara is none other than Shiva without the vinAyaka with Him. There are names like 'shambhusUnuH' as epithet of Ganapathi. This AchArya Shankara is a sannyAsi with sannyAsi disciples (this is 
said by Padmapada in the first two lines of this same verse) and 
therefore no 'family' is depicted. Dr.Mani Dravid Sastrigal said that it is a 'vyatireka alankAra' adopted in the said verse, where Shankara, 
the Acharya, is 'contrasted' with Shankara, the Lord. It also throws 
light on the belief even during the Acharya's time that Shankaracharya 
was the incarnation of Shiva.
