PraNAms - Here the problem anubhuuti is not of the type that involves tripuTi, since it is aparoksha -since itthe self that I am.Hence it involvesjust knowledge that is direct and immediate as in the 10th man case by dropping misconceptions about oneself. draShtavyaH - Shankara interprets as aparoxatayaa jnaatavyaH. Hence it is jnaanam than anubhavam. The rest is exercise in grammar.
