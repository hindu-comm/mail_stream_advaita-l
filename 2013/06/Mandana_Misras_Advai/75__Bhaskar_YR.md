avidyA (of the
Brahmasiddhi) is the same as what Shankara has stated, that is, the one
which is of the nature of adhyAsa and which is jnAnanivartya

Thanks for clarifying this.  Though I donot know what exactly the position 
of brahmasiddhi, shankara used the term avidyA keeping the  'adhyAsa' or 
mithyAjnAna in mind.  Shankara is quite clear in explaining this in his 
adhyAsa bhAshya where he says : the avidyA whic is of the nature of 
adhyAsa being responsible or the cause for the undesirable problem of the 
empirical transaction of the type 'ahaMkAra' mamakAra, which is clearly 
perceptible to everyone.  Unfortunately no where in the adhyAsa bhAshya he 
talked about the phenomenon called jnAna virOdhi, bhAva rUpa, mUlAvidyA 
(which is not jnAnAbhAva)  which is the material cause for adhyAsa. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

PS :  BTW, I read somewhere that even mandana mishra too talks about the 
advaitins who propagate the theory of avidyOpadAnakAraNa !!  Do you have 
any reference from this brahmasiddhi prabhuji??
