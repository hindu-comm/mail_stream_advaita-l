On the question of 'avidyA' in Mandanamisra's Brahmasiddhi, the eminent
scholar    Dr.Mani Dravid SastriNaH said that this author has mentioned
about avidyA in several places in his work and that avidyA (of the
Brahmasiddhi) is the same as what Shankara has stated, that is, the one
which is of the nature of adhyAsa and which is jnAnanivartya (dispelled by
Knowledge).
