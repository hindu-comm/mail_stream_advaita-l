In the adhyAsa bhAShya itself there are statements that mean that
adhyAsa/avidyA is removed by jnanam/vidyA.  For instance, the very last
sentence: 'asya anartha-hetoH prahANAya, AtmaikatvavidyA-pratipattaye sarvE
vEdAntAH Arabhyante.'  So, according to Shankara the purpose of the
upanishads is to teach that knowledge of the unity of the Self and through
that the removal of the cause of all calamity.  Thus knowledge, vidyA, is
the remover of avidyA which is the cause of anartha.

Again, in the latter half of the adhyasa bhashya we have 'prAk cha
tathAbhUta-Atma-vijnAnAt shAstram avidyAvadviShayam na ativartate'.
'before attaining that knowledge of the Self as described just before
(vedAnta vedyam ashanAyAdyatItam...the Self that is known only through the
upanishads characterized by freedom from hunger, etc. brAhmaNa jAti,
etc...) Here too we have the avidyAdRShTi and the vidyA that removes that.

Apart from the adhyAsa bhAShya references, we have a very direct reference
to the jnAnanivartyatva of avidyA in the mandukya kaarikAbhaShya 1.2  that
we have seen several times over recently:  jnAna-dAhya-bIjAbhAve
jnAnArthakyaprasangaH ['If we do not admit of a seed (ignorance) that is
not burnt by knowledge, the upanishadic teaching of knowledge will be
without any purpose to seve']  Here the jnAnanivartyatva of ajnAna/avidyA
is very clear.

In the Bh.G 5.16 jnAnena tu tadajnAnam yEShAm nAshitamAtmanaH.. Shankara
says: ajnAnam AtmaviShayeNa vivekajnAnEna nAshitam bhavati...[ ajnAna is
destroyed by Self-knowledge]

The above is only a sample.

That avidyopAdAnakAraNa is also available in shAnkara's bhashya for the
13th chapter last verse:  for the term 'bhUtaprakRti' shankara writes:
bhUtAnAm prakRtiH avidyAlakShaNA avyaktAkhyA...tasyAH abhAvagamanam.  Now,
if this avyakta is an abhAva vastu, one cannot use the word 'tasyAH'.
'prakRtiH means kAraNam. There cannot be an abhAvagamanam of abhAvaH.  Even
if we say 'unknownness'  ends, still only what 'is' alone can come to an
end.  From this bhashya sentence itself we can understand that a certain
'sattA' is accorded to it when alone will it be possible to negate it. That
is the way in which the term 'bhAvarUpatva' with relation to avidyA is to
be understood.
