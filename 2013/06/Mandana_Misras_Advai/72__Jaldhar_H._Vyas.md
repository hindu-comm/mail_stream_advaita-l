Before.  While Mandana Mishra is mainly known as a Mimamsaka, many of the 
early acharyas in the Vedic tradition wrote on both Mimamsa and Vedanta 
topics.  In fact one could say it was Shankaracharya's insistence on 
kevalajnana which is responsible for the two being considered as separate 
darshanas today.

According to tradition, Mandana Mishra was an older contemporary of 
Shankaracharya.  After being defeated in debate, he recanted his views and 
took up Bhagavatapadas.  Presumably this applies to his Vedantic views as 
well as his Mimamsaka ones.
