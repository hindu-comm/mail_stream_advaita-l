brahmakāṇda page 26 direct reference to a separate school that is 
Shankara's:tathāparaih "adhyāropāpavādābhyām niṣprapancham 
prapanchyate"And so say others "that which is beyond the manifested is 
made manifest by the method of false attribution and retraction"You can 
see here a very early direct separation of the school of Shankara and the 
school that later become known as vivaraṇam

praNAms Sri Subhanu prabhuji

Thanks a lot for quoting these references from brahmasiddhi.  It is really 
regrettable that later vvAkhyAnakAra-s have opted for the alternative / 
oppsosite method of shankara siddhAnta.  It is clear that at the time of 
origination of brahmasiddhi itself there were two divergent view points 
and out of those two view points one view point which is propagating the 
avidyOpAdAnakAraNa  is quite opposed to shankara's advaita view point.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
