Thanks for the information. It's very useful.

Is this from the introduction? You probably agree with me that this is at
best a very creative interpretation of this yajus passage. I wish the
author hadn't gone down this route. As is clear from the passages around it
as well as the bhAShyams of both sAyaNa and bhaTTa-bhAskara, this means
that *understanding* the procedure of the ritual and thinking/reciting
(about) the procedure gives the same result as doing the ritual itself.
Furthermore sAyaNa explains in his rg-veda bhAShya bhUmikA how this is not
at variance with jaiminis sUtra on knowing the procedure versus actual
performance.
