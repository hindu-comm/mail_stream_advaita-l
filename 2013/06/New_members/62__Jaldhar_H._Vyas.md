I am interested in knowing more about advaita as originally postulated by
Shankara.

Kindly subscribe me to this list. I am interested in following the
discussions. Am a regular Veda chanter at multiple temples here in this area
chanting all Suktams as well as Rudram, Taitriya Upanishad and continuing to
learn and expand my chanting.

Thanks and Rgds,
S Rao
