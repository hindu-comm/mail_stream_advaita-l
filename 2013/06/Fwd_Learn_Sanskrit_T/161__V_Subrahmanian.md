Subject: Learn Sanskrit Through Ramayanam


hariH OM,

   Inspired by Shri Shripad Abhyankar's Learn Sanskrit through Gita site,
we have created a site on learning Sanskrit through Ramayanam. We dedicate
it to the shriicharaNa of bhagavaan. It is a work in progress which will be
updated often.

   Please have a look at the site here:
http://learn-sanskrit-through-ramayanam.blogspot.in/

svasti,
              JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,

shrivathsa.
