Currently I am listening to a Telugu discourse series on the SundarakANDam
by the famed Vidwan Chaganti Koteswara Rao.  It is available in the
following URL.  The discourse is packed with a lot of Vedanta that will be
very useful for sadhaka-s.  His brilliant narrative is full of citations
from a number of scriptural works, including those of Shankaracharya.
Telugu-knowing people can benefit  immensely from the discourses:
