> Currently I am listening to a Telugu discourse series on the SundarakANDam
> by the famed Vidwan Chaganti Koteswara Rao.  It is available in the
> following URL.  The discourse is packed with a lot of Vedanta that will be
> very useful for sadhaka-s.  His brilliant narrative is full of citations
> from a number of scriptural works, including those of Shankaracharya.
> Telugu-knowing people can benefit  immensely from the discourses:
