There is also nowhere in any of the Shankara Vijayas any direct statement that Vishwarupa was the name of Mandana Mishra.

I read quite sometime ago that after their discussions Mandana Mishra sent Adi Shankara to meet his relative (probably brother-in law) Vishwarupa and it was Vishwarupa, who became a Sanyashi and accomapnied Adi Shankara to Shringeri. But I do not recall the details now. Have you also read any such account?
