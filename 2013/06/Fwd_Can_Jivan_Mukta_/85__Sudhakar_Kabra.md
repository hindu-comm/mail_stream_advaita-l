Very nicely said.
It is better to assess ourselves than a jeevanmukta.

Since jnani has no will of his own can't we say that his will is one with
that of hiranygarbha
hence no question of his offending somebody.

If jivanmukta is subject to do's and dont's what is his jivanmukti for and
what is he mukta of?

Let us not worry about the do's and dont's of Jivanmukta but worry about
ours.
