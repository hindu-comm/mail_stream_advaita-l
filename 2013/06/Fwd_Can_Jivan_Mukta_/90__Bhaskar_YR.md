I think Vidyaranya in Jiivanmuktaviveka points out the gradations in 
Jiivanmukti status.

praNAms Sri Sadananda prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes, I too read this gradation in jnAni-s...To make this gradation, the 
base is 'samAdhi' experience and the method they adopt to come back from 
that state to  the 'normal' state.  According to this varishTa type of 
jnAni-s would never come back to normal state..samAdhi is the final state 
for them.  Kindly correct me if I misrepresented the stand of this 
gradation & reason for these gradations.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
