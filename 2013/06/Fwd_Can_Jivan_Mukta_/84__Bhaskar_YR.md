Since jnani has no will of his own can't we say that his will is one with
that of hiranygarbha hence no question of his offending somebody.

>  Yes, there is no separate will (iccha) for the jnAni who has identified 
himself with 'all', sarvAtmabhAva or samyak drushti. 

If jivanmukta is subject to do's and dont's what is his jivanmukti for and 
what is he mukta of?

>  he is mukta from dehAtma buddhi, he is mukta from katrutva, bhOktrutva 
but as you might have seen, this muktAvastha is not in absolute sense when 
jnAni is in his bhautika shareera which is the result of prArabdha.  Hence 
he is still subject to kAma - krOdha and as a result he will have 
vipareeta pratyaya also but these things will not come in the way of jnAni 
just because he is paramArtha jnAni !! ??  Just like you, I too wondered 
what sort of mukti it is !!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
