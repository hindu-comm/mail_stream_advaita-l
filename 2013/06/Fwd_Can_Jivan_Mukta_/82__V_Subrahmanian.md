In the Brahmasutra 4.1.13 it is decided that upon getting the direct
knowledge of Brahman there will be the destruction of all previous karma
(which has not begun to bear fruit) and there will be non-attachment with
all future karma (that which will be performed by the Jnani  till the fall
of the body).  Hence, upon the expiry of prArabdha (that karma that has
already begun giving fruit by commencing this particular body) there will
be no more birth.

Hence any such 'lapses' (adhArmic acts) will  not attach to the jnani who
has identified himself with the Atman/Brahman; the avidyA has been
extinguished. (jnAnena tu tadajnAnam yEShAm nAshitamAtmanaH..BhG)  They
will be only 'acts' of the body-mind complex which is inert and as per the
shruti, this sUkShma sharIram of the jnani will not, cannot, transmigrate;
they will disintegrate and merge with prakRti upon the jnani's death.  So,
there will be no 'person' any longer whom Ishwara could punish, if at all.
Hence, technically the situation envisaged by you is impossible.   In the
case of non-jnanis, however, since there is the identification with the
mind-body complex, there is a certain individual, jIva, who will
transmigrate by default.
