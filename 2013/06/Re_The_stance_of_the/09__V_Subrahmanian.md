In the Bh.gitA itself we have the instruction:

'tattvavit tu mahAbAho, guNakarmavibhAgayoH. guNAH guNeShu vartanta iti
matvA na sajjate' 3.28 [The knower of the truth about guNa

'indriyANi indriyArtheShu vartanta iti dhArayan...5.9.

In the 2.16 the teaching is about the two-fold realization of a tattvavit:
1. na asataH bhAvo vidyate and 2. na sataH abhAvo vidyate.  ubhayorapi
....They have the realization of both the nature of the Atman and the
knowledge about the nature of the anAtman.  This instruction is again
stated in different words in the last verse of the 13th chapter:  1. the
viveka between kshetra and kshetrajna and knowing oneself to be the
kshetrajna and 2. bhUtaprakRti mokSham cha: shankara comments for this:
bhUtAnAm prakRti avidyAlakShaNA avyaktAkhyA tasyAH abhAvagamanam cha.
Knowledge of both the Atman and the non-existence of the anAtman.  If only
the first is there, it will be un-vedAntic/un-advaitic realization where
there will be the separation from kshetra but the kshetra will continue to
be real. To preclude this the verse and the bhashya make so much emphasis
on the latter too.

In the Ishopanishat first mantra the bhashya specifies the kind of
knowledge/realization with which the entire jagat is to be 'covered':

// 'ahameva idam sarvam iti paramArtha satyarUpeNa, anRtam idam sarvam
carAcaram AcChAdanIyam svena paramAtmanA':  One can see the translation.
The important feature of this is: 1. the satyam here is paramArtha satyam
and not vyaavahArika and 2. as a result of this, the sarvam charAcharam is
held to be anRtam/false.' //

In the examples you have shown one aspect is stated, but it implies the
other aspect too, as explicitly shown in these examples by Shankara
Himself.

Whatever be the context, the matter discussed is about the 'type' of
brahman obtaining in suShupti/pralaya.

//tasmAt jnAnadAhyabIjAbhAve cha jnAnArthakyaprasangaH' [Therefore if there
is no 'seed' that is burnt by Jnana, the instruction of the shruti on
JnAnam will be futile] 'tasmAt bIjatva-abhyupagamenaiva sataH
prANatvavyapadeshaH sarvashrutiShu cha kAraNatvavyapadeshaH' [Therefore
only by admitting the 'seed'-presence in Brahman (sopadhikabrahman) the Sat
(brahman) is denoted by the word 'prANa' (in 'prANabandhanam hi somya
manaH' of the chandogya which Shankara cites in this paragraph) in  ALL
shruti passages and WHEREVER brahman is specified as the cause of
creation.]//

There cannot be a more unambiguous statement from the bhashya on this
topic: 1. the brahman with which the jIva attains sat-sampatti in sushupti
/ pralaya is the sabIja brahman.  In the above bhashya Shankara is talking
about the jnAnavirodhi ajnAnabIjam because it is the jnAnadAhyam.  If there
were no positive entity, there is no way of calling it jnAnadAhyam, a
subject matter (object) of jnAnena dahanam.  2. Whenever brahman is spoken
of as the cause of creation/sustenance it is again this sabIja brahman
alone.

The thinking that there is no avidyA in deep sleep has arisen because of
the mistaken idea that the jIva has satsampatti with the shuddha svarUpam.
It is this idea that Shankara refutes in the above bhashya by giving a
ruling that is to be applied as a rider whenever one talks about avidya in
sushupti/jagatkAraNa brahman: it is the sopAdhika brahman and NOT the
nirupAdhika brahman with which satsampatti is had in sleep.  In the Br.up.
the sleep state is given as an analogy for moksha.  An analogy does not
tally with the matter taught in all respects.  Here, the common features
are: 1. no vyakta dvaita anubhava (avyakta dvaita is there in bIjarUpa) 2.
there is sukha anubhava even without any viShaya. 3. advaita anubhava.

In liberation the avyakta dvaita is also not there.

It is not shuddha Atman either.  Otherwise, as Shankara has countered in
the mandukya bhashya I cited above, the jiva will never return from that
satsampatti.  Yad gatvA na nivartante ...that is the shuddha svarUpa.  What
you have said above is to be read along with the passage I have cited.
That is why that passage assumes supreme importance in the prasthAnatraya
bhashya, occupying the status of a ruling.

Yes. Parabrahman is also sometimes refered to mean the sopAdhika brahman to
differentiate it from mAyA.  Again  that sentence of Shankara is to be read
along with the ruling stated by me.

It is only because we cannot analyse our sushupti anubhava does the shruti
comes to aid our understanding.
