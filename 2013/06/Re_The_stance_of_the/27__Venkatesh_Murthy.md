Before entering on an examination of the System expounded in Suresvara's
Vartika it is necessary to begin first with an examination of the system of
the Brahma Siddhi of Mandana Misra to help the reader in his approach.
Sometimes the lines of argument found in the Brahma Siddhi are followed in
Suresvara's Vartika just as they stand. Sometimes the actual words, phrases
and arguments are reproduced.

Mandana writing on Ignorance -

Method of Vedanta Page 262 -
'But for Mandana Ignorance means positive error. This emerges for instance
from the passage 'Non apprehension being a non entity cannot be a cause of
anything. It cannot be the cause of erroneous vision or it would cause it
in coma or dreamless sleep. What then is the cause of erroneous vision? Not
non perception but as we have already said beginningless purposeless
Ignorance. It is useless to ask for a cause of beginningless Ignorance.
Because erroneous vision and the impressions it leaves act on each other
mutually as cause and effect our theory can stand'. Brahma Siddhi page 33.
That is to say new erroneous vision leaves impressions which in turn beget
new erroneous visions which in turn beget new impressions and so on. One
may imagine the series of causes stretching back endlessly. '

This is like the Beeja Ankura Cause and Effect.
