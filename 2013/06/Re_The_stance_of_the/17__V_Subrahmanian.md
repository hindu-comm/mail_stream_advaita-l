Namaste

I have observed that the traditional scholars are quite well-read with
regard to Sureshwara's works.  I have myself been taught the Taittiriya
VArtika while this upanishad was being taught.  The Naishkarmyasiddhi is
also generally taught.  The Br. up. vArtika has remained in the background
mainly because of its volume and because many have not the patience to sit
through the huge work.  The late Vidwan Sri Kudur Krishna Jois who had
participated in the first mUlAvidyA debate in Bangalore has made a Kannada
translation of the entire Br.up. vArtika.  The huge volume of manuscript is
yet to be published.  Maybe only one or two volumes have been published.

To my knowledge there is no such view.  The scholars I have interacted with
have only been eager to substantiate Shankara's bhashya with citing
Sureshwara's views.
