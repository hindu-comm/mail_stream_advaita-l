To reiterate the upadeshasaahasrii 1.16.18:

 jAgratsvapnau tayobIjaM suShuptaakhyaM tamomayam.h .
 anyonyasminnasattvaachcha naastItyetat-trayaM tyajet.h ..

 "Transmigratory existence consists of waking and dream.
 Their root is deep sleep consisting of Ignorance (i.e. tamas).
 No one of these three states has a real existence because
 each goes out of existence when another remains in it.
 One should therefore give up all these THREE states."

Note the "trayaM tyajet.h" -- "Give up THREE states". Obviously, this means to reject
jAgrat-svapna-suShupti. If Deep Sleep were really the paramArtha state, would Sankara ask
us to reject it or remain in it?

What you call mukti is available as a sleeping pill in your local pharmacy!
