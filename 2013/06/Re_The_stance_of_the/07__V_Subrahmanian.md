Dear Bhaskar ji,

Two instances I recall as references for the above question of yours:

1. At the end of the BGB 2.16 Shankara says:

//त्वमपि तत्त्वदर्शिनां दृष्टिमाश्रित्य शोकं मोहं च हित्वा शीतोष्णादीनि
नियतानियतरूपाणि द्वन्द्वानि 'विकारोऽयमसन्नेव मरीचिजलवन्मिथ्यावभासते' इति
मनसि निश्चित्य तितिक्षस्व इत्यभिप्रायः।।//
//Therefore, you too, by adopting the vision of the men of realization and
giving up sorrow and delusion, forbear the dualities, heat, cold, etc. --
some of which are definite in their nature, and others inconstant --,
mentally being convinced that this (phenomenal world) is changeful, verily
unreal and appears falsely like water in a mirage. This is the idea.//


2. The second verse of the manIShA panchakam:
ब्रह्मैवाहमिदं जगच्च सकलं चिन्मात्रविस्तारितं *सर्वं चैतदविद्यया
त्रिगुणयाऽशेषं मया कल्पितम् |* इत्थं यस्य दृढा मतिः सुखतरे नित्ये परे
निर्मले चाण्डालोऽस्तु स तु द्विजोऽस्तु गुरुरित्येषा मनीषा मम ||२||

//'I am brahman, this entire world is an appearance in the Pure
consciousness, all this is an imagination by me out of avidyA' such a firm
conviction whoever has with regard to the Supreme Self, .....is the Guru.
Such is My conclusion.//

More than any other bhashya vakyam this is the one that decides on the
above issue:

The ruling has been given by Shankara in the mandukya karika bhashya 1.2
already cited by me:


//*It is spoken of as the cause in all the upanishads by assuming it for
the time being to be the seed of others*.  And it is because of this that
It is referred to - by refuting Its causal state - in such Vedic texts as
'.....That supremely real state - free from causality, relating with body,
etc. and modes of waking etc.  of that very entity ....as the Turiya....//


Shankara here distinguishes between two 'states' of Brahman: 1. that which
obtains in the sushupti/pralaya as the causal state: sabIjAvasthA.  It is
this conditioned-brahman Shankara avers, every jiva goes into during
sushupti/pralaya. It is not, therefore, the shuddha brahman. Shankara gives
reasons thereof.

2. that which is ever pure, untouched by any creation/jivas which is taught
as the turiya in the seventh mantra of the mandukya upanishat.  It is this
brahman that is vijneyaH for liberation.  It is this brahman attaining
which there will be no return to samsara.

To read this part of the bhashya in the original will give the necessary
effect.
