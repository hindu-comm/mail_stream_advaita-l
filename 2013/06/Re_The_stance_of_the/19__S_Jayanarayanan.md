The upadeshasaahasrii 1.14.19:

AtmA hyAtmiiya ityeSha bhAvo.avidyAprakalpitaH .
Atmaikatve hyasau nAsti bIjAbhAve kutaH phalam.h ..

Swami Jagadananda's translation:

"For the ideas 'me' and 'mine' are superimposed on the Self due to
Ignorance. They do not exist when the Self is known to be one only.
How can there be an effect without a cause?"

The statement "bIjAbhAve kutaH phalam.h?" literally translated is:

"HOW CAN THERE BE A FRUIT WITH AN UNREAL (abhAva) SEED (bIja)?"

So your claim that there is a "seed" or "bIja", but that is cannot be classified as not-unreal,
directly contradicts Sankara!
