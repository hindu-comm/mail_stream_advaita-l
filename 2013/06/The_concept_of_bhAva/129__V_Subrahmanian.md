In the GK1.2 bhashya the last sentence after Shankara firmly establishes
the bhAvarUpa samsAra kAraNAvidyA which is jnAnavirodhi in deep sleep by
the words ' jnAnadAhyabIjAbhAve jnAnAnArthakyaprasangaH' [if we do not
accept a seed state persisting in sleep state that is dispelled by the
Upanishadic Knowledge, then the teaching of Knowledge (for samsAra nivRtti)
in the shastra will be futile' (because there is nothing that the Knowledge
will/can dispel], concludes the discussion with these words: 'bIjAvasthA pi
'na kinchid avediSham' iti utthitasya pratyayadarshanAt dehE anubhUyate
eva...' [the above (bhAvarUpa samsAra kAraNAvidyA which is jnAnavirodhi) is
experienced by everyone in the (waking) body itself from the fact of the
recollection 'I did not know anything' during deep sleep.

Now, it would look like Shankara is contradicting Himself when we look at
the sentences quoted by you and what is quoted by me above.  But there is
no room for such a fault.  For, in the quotes given by you the reason for
not apprehending the objects during sleep state (which would have been
apprehended if the person were waking) is stated as the non-functioning of
instruments of knowledge during sleep.  But what is stated in the GK 1.2 is
the proof of persistence of the kAraNAvidyA that is present in all states,
even when the anyathAdarshanam of the tattvam is had in the waking and
dream states.  This kAraNAvidyA is not distinctly discerned/apprehended in
the waking and dream states because one is caught in the anyathAgrahaNam.
It is in the sleep state that when the anyathAgrahaNam is not there one can
clearly experience the bIjAvasthA which is jnAnavirodhi.
