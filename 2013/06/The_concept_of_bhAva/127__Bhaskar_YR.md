praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

In the BGB 13th ch.last verse 'bhUtAnAm prakRtiH...avidyAlakShaNA
avyaktAkhyA.. tasyAH abhAvagamanam' it is not nimitta-naimittika but
upAdAna-upAdeya.  In that chapter and also in the 7th ch. it is well
established as to how prakRti is the one that has manifested as the
universe.

I failed to understand how this going to help you to establish the 
bhAvarUpa, brahmAbhinna mUlAvidyA!!??  For that matter, in the 7th chapter 
itself,  for example 4 to 7 verses, lord says he has two prakruti-s i.e. 
parApara through which he does the creation...I dont know how the 
statement : 'avyAkruta prakruti has become vyAkruta prapaNcha' which is 
finally establishing the ultimate truth of brahmaikatva,  is helping the 
bhAvarUpa avidyA advocation.  I hope you are not holding these references 
out of context here. 

jnAnAbhAva as conceived of by Sri SSS is not jnAnadAhya, for there will be 
nothing that jnAna can burn.

>  jnAna does not have the capacity to burn anything, it only shows us 
what already IS !!  jnAna does not have the capacity to create or destroy 
anything.  The dawn of jnAna does not burn the avidyA it sublates avidyA 
means jnAni would realize that there was/is/will be no avidyA at all.  So, 
your objection here on Sri SSS or shankara's view on jnAnAbhAva is totally 
untenable. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
