Namaste

In the BGB 13th ch.last verse 'bhUtAnAm prakRtiH...avidyAlakShaNA
avyaktAkhyA.. tasyAH abhAvagamanam' it is not nimitta-naimittika but
upAdAna-upAdeya.  In that chapter and also in the 7th ch. it is well
established as to how prakRti is the one that has manifested as the
universe.

The 'jnAna-dAhya-bIjAbhAve jnAnAnArthakya prasangaH' of the GK1.2 bhashyam
is the indisputable proof of a bhAvarUpa avidya persisting in sleep/pralaya
that is jnAnavirodhi.  There are several references to this phenomenon in
the shruti/smrti/bhashyam.  jnAnAbhAva as conceived of by Sri SSS is not
jnAnadAhya, for there will be nothing that jnAna can burn.

That any discourse on Vedanta is within superimposition is well known.
That is why even mokSha vyavahAra utilizing   mokSha shAstra, the
upanishads, is stated to be avidyAvadviShaya in the adhyAsabhashyam.

Agreed that that is the purpose of the shAstra.  Yet shankara indulges in
the discussion of the nature of samvRti as whether it is bhAva or abhAva.
That such samvRti is jnAnadAhya is also stated by shankara unambiguously.
The bhAva/abhAva discussion in the Cha.up. is centered on the
upadAnakAranatvam and not on nimitta-naimittika. The possibility of some
passages being explained either way is what at the center of dispute. But
which way is the bhAShyakAra's is the moot point. This feature came to the
fore in the recent meet in Bangalore.  Both schools hold that the other has
diverged/departed from shankara and sureshwara.  In fact the hosting
Swamiji openly expressed the purpose of the/this meet as his hope of
bringing about a conciliation and that it is disappointing that such a
result is not emerging.
