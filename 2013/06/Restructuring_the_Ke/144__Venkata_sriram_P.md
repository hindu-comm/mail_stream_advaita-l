Namaste,

Let us be more concerned aboutthe people stuck over there 
rather than the temple.

The situation is just pathetic to see with dead bodies around. 

The priest of Kedarnath temple lost his son and yet he 
says in the interview "sab shiv ki iccha hai". This is 
called "advaita in practice". 

regs,
sriram
