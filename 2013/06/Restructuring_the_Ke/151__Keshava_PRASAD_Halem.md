The Himalayan range is like a divine umbrella of protection for the entire bhaaratvarShapuNyabhUmi.
Unscrupulous abuse of mother-nature (raping of mother-earth/mother-nature) has been happening all around the earth.
Minor abuses here and there although incessant, have been tolerated by the infinitely merciful mother goddess.
Let us pray and hope that this calamity is taken as a clear stop-signal for all such acts of abuse.
