Dear respected list
members,

 Pranam.

First, let me extend my
heartfelt condolences to the devotees, tourists and locals died and suffered in
recent terrible flood of UttaraKhanda mainly in the vicinity of the KedarNath
temple -- a great shrine believed to be established by the Bhagavatpada. This
is the great harm to all Hindus.

I request to spare
little space of this list to discuss on this tragic incidence to condole the
victims, find the way out to help those trapped and mainly what to do to
restore the shrine and its vicinity.

I urge the list members
to voice for more than restoration of one of the greatest revered shrine of the
Hindus. For this the government of India and that of UttaraKhanda as well as
all Indians, Nepalis and Hindus should join hands to convert this curse of
nature to boon and convert present unprecedented mourning/grief to equally
unmatchable strength of the Hindus.

My suggestion is to
start with a master-plan where our ingenuity, resource, knowledge of shastras
(including the vedas, shiva puranas and other puranas and smritis), hindu
vastukalas and modern architechure are all act together. All let our faith,
civilization, creativeness splendor, awareness and Hindu unity work together
for this noble cause.

While executing the
project, ournoble expectations may be achieved if we consider the
following points before hand:
·Standards and provisions of the Vedas, Puranas
(including Shivapurana), Smritis and other Hindu scriptures regarding
the works like this;
·Stapatya-shastra of the East and the modern
Western architectural developments be blended and balanced;
·New information and technology, scientific
development, art and philosophical achievements;
·Ecological and environmental problems/issues,
social and economic dynamics, security problems (man-made and natural disasters
included), war, etc.;
·Pilgrimage tourism including problems and
success stories of the world renowned religious spots of Pashupatinath,
Jerusalem, Lumbini, Mecca, etc.;
·Expectations and requirements of general
devotees, locals and religious businesses.

Without a cautious move
to restore the whole KedarNath area may prove unhelpful if not
counterproductive.

With best regards,

Bishwa Prakash Subedi
