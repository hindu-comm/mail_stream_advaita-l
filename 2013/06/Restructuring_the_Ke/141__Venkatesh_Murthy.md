Namaste

It is a great tragedy and huge loss of human lives but the temple is still
standing. Lord Shiva is great. He is Mahadeva. We have to consider one
point. There should not be unnecessary new structures and  modern
architecture. It should be restored and repaired back to old style. Then
the devotees can worship with full faith there is no change in the temple.
