There are many on the list who have studied Sankara's works much better than I have (including the person to whom I'm replying now), but the case for the tradition is not presented fully and hence this response.

The fallacy in the above argument lies in the assumption that there is an exact dichotomy in
advaita VedAnta consisting of Atman and anAtman. Even in the above quote(s) from Sureshvara,
it is important to underline the fact that He does NOT classify avidyA as anAtman!

Sankara in the upadeshasAhasrI 2.1.18 proposes the third category (translation by Swami Jagadananda):

 ... paripUrNa AkAshavatanantashaktiH AtmA sarvasya, ashanAyAdivarjitaH,
 AvirbhAvatirobhAvavarjitashcha svAtmavilakShaNayornAmarUpayorjagadbIjabhUtayoH svAtmasthayoH
 tattvAnyatvAbhyAmanirvachanIyayoH svasaMvedyayoH sadbhAvamAtreNAchintyashaktitvAd 
 vyAkartAvyAkR^itayoH .. 18 ..

 "... that Self of all devoid of hunger etc., as also appearance and disappearance, is by
 virtue of Its inscrutable power, the cause of the manifestation of unmanifested name and form
 which abide in the Self through Its very presence, but are different from It, which are the
 seed of the universe, are *** describable neither as identical with It nor different from It ***,
 and are cognized by It alone."

The nAmarUpa and AkAshavat-ananta-shakti of the AtmA (Self) are said to be:

 tattva-anyatvAbhyAm-anirvachanIya = "Indescribable as either the same (Atman) or different (anAtman)"

This third category of "anirvachanIya" is precisely where avidyA (too) falls under.

Deep Sleep is filled with tamas, vide upadeshasaahasrii 1.16.18:

 jAgratsvapnau tayobIjaM suShuptaakhyaM tamomayam.h .
 anyonyasminnasattvaachcha naastItyetattrayaM tyajet.h ..

 "Transmigratory existence consists of waking and dream.
 Their root is deep sleep consisting of Ignorance (i.e. tamas).
 No one of these three states has a real existence because
 each goes out of existence when another remains in it.
 One should therefore give up all these three states."

Note the phrase "suShuptaakhyaM tamomayam.h" -- to say that there is no avidyA in deep sleep
goes against Sankara's works.

The exact same teaching by Ramana Maharshi from His book Self-enquiry:

 "...in deep sleep the gross and subtle bodies of all the individual souls are included in the
 **cosmic maya which is nescience, of the nature of sheer darkness**, and since the souls are
 resolved in the Self becoming one with It, they see everywhere darkness alone. From the darkness
 of sleep, the subtle body, viz. egoity, and from that (egoity) the gross body arise respectively."

Note that Ramana Bhagavan says that the state of Deep Sleep contains "Maya" = "Nescience" = "Darkness",
which is a reference to the "tamas" of the upadeshasaahasrii.

All sAdhanA is to rid oneself of avidyA, whose existence is admitted before sAdhanA commences
and non-existence admitted in the goal of Liberation.

Of course none would disagree with the last statement above.

But let there be no criticism of the teachings of the unbroken lineage of the Gurus of the
Sankaran tradition prior to careful examination of their views (preferably under a teacher of the
tradition)!
