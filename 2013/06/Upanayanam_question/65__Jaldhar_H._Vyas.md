According to dharmashastras like dharmasindhu, upanayana should be done in 
uttarayana, in shukla paksha, and on any tithi except anadhayana days 
(mainly pratipada and ashtami.)  However due to astrological 
considerations, it has become an achara to avoid the days where jyeshta 
nakshatra prevails.  (I have not heard about it for the whole jyeshta masa 
but I wouldn't be surprised if some people believed it.)  My personal 
opinion is that if minor details make people miss out on performing 
shrauta/smarta obligations they are missing the wood for the trees.

One of the prayoga books I use has shanti for children born in 
jyeshta nakshatra which can be adopted for this purpose by changing a 
few words in the samkalpa.  I can send to you if you want it.
