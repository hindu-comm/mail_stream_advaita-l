I would like to join this advaita group to learn and also to share my
readings and the advaita books that I have read through. here is my brief
introduction.

I am learing krishna yajur veda taitriya samhita from my gurunatha in
chennai. Meanwhile I have also completed a course in manuscriptology
(reading grantha script) from rashtriya sanskrit vidyapeeth, tirupati.
