Namaste,

Sharing some of my thoughts on this topic:

- Rk-s explain the tattva-s and their inter-relation in the context of 
 the vidyA. These are the basic texts of any science, art or skill.
- yajna is worship, or sAdhanA (efforts)for acquisition of the vidyA.
- Signing of Rk-s (sAma gAna) is perfecting the vidyA via practice 
 supplemented by re-reading the basic texts to see what was missed
 earlier or not understood earlier is now more clearer

These three steps are universally applicable to any skill or art (vidyA).

It seems internalization of the vidyA (anusandhAna) is a separate step 
- though it may seem related to the third step of perfecting the vidyA.
This probably is addressed by the atharva angirasa vidyA. chakra-s,
kuNDalini, and related topics would likely fall in the domain of
this internalization step.

By far the best anusandhAna of any vidyA is to use it as an element of
bhagavad bhakti. So bhagavad bhakti very likely is the simplest and
the best upAya (remedy/ solution/ technique) of artharva angirasa vidyA.

hari om.

Regards,
Shrinivas
