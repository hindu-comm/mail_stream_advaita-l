The word "Apaurusheyatvam"has been wrongly understood.It doesnot mean "Not by a Purusha"or not said or made by man.It also means "that which is ever present or eternal".In that sense,the vedas w2hich speak about the "Supreme Truth"which is ever present or eternal is "Apaurusheya","Not by man".That which has the power of "Long standing or eternal"is "Apaurusheya".
N.Srikanta.
