Namaste

I have uploaded a few pages from the book 'jIvanmuktabhArati' published by
the Sringeri Sharada Peetham in 2005.  It has an English translation too,
with explanatory notes, in the same book. The English portion covering the
five khyAtivAda-s (Theories of 'Error' according to the various schools of
Indian Philosophy)  is in the scanned pages and members who are interested
may read the same by using this URL:
