Radhe Krishna

What is irking much is surrender of wealth. 

na karmaNa na prajayA dhanEna thyAgEnaikE amrutatvamAsasu:

Sanyasa is taken after sacrificing karma, family and wealth.

To demand a sanyasi to surrender wealth ( something which he is not supposed to 
own)is sort of unimaginable flaw from those who are supposed to uphold tradition.

Radhe Krishna

The Upanishath says:
"Na karmana na prajaya Dhanena thyagenaikenaiva amrutatva manashu".
This may be true during the Upanishath times.But,what we see today is they are prepared to sacrifice,Karma,praja,but not dhana.It seems,this has been modified by them as:
Na karmana,prajaya,na tyagena-Dhanainekenaiva amrtatva manashu.It is high time that one starts questioning the credibility of these sanyasis!
