It is said that akhaNDAkAra vritii destroys avidya which is accepted by
all. But the question is, do all the schools agree that the vritti destroys
itself and that the duality cease where atman alone shines which
automatically leads to chiita vritti nirodha? Is this mandatory for
aparOkshajnAna?

Pointers and pramANa vAkyas are requested.
