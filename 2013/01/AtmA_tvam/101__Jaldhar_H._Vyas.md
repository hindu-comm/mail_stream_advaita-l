In all the recent discussion this question seems to have been overlooked.

This is one of my favorites.  It is a standalone stotra not part of any 
larger work.  (It has one more shloka btw karacharaNakR^itam vA which is 
often known seperately.)  it is true that it was not included in the Vani 
Vilasa edition of the complete works of Shankaracharya which is as near to 
a canonical edition that we have.  Neither it seems have any of the old 
commentators such as Anandagiri or Svayamprakash Yati written a tika on 
it.  However every single source that does mention it unanimously 
considers it to be the composition of Adi Shankaracharya.  They always 
call it by this name only. So it is impossible to give a definitive 
answer as to whether it is genuine.
