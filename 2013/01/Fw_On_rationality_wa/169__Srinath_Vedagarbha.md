Dear Sri Ramesh Krishnamurthy, Namaste.

In a nutshell, your position is akin to "whatever is pramANa-siddha it is
bAdhya, whatever is svataH-siddha it is abAdhya"



If we were to accept vEdAnta-pAribhAsha's definition of pramANa, the
abAdhitvam is already factored into it (along with anadhigatatvam etc.).
Now if you were to make pramANasiddha things as bAdhya, it goes against
definition of pramANa as defined in VP.



Also, from another angle, since the truth in your above stand is not svataH
siddha as such, it can be considered as yet another pramEya in itself and
begs for a pramANa.

I agree in a limited sense. No doubt Atman is svataHsiddha, but you need
pramANa (shruti in this case) to tell more about it -- such as making
 aikya (identity) statements of myself with Brahman etc. In this sense, not
sure how you shield advaita-vedanta from being a thesis.

Srinath
