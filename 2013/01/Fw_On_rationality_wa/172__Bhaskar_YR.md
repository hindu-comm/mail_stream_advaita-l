It is in this light that one should understand the Advaitic view of the
entire Veda(anta) being valid only in the vyavaharic state which is
characterized by the tripuTee : pramAtR, pramANa and prameya.

>  And from pAramArthik view point this shAstra vyavahAra & other 
vyavahAra-s as well do not exist apart from the Self.  That is what has 
been said in the above extract : 

(a) Even prior to and after the realization of the Universal Self, it is 
held that the shAstra or its validity has no existence other than that of 
the Self.

(b) That the shAstra is regarded as being different from Self is only 
because of ignorance.

>  The point to be noted here is shankara does say apart from Self there 
exists nothing!!  sadAtmanA satyatvAbhyupagamAt sarvavyavahArANAM, 
sarvavikArANAM cha satyatvaM says somewhere shankara.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
