Earlier I had written about two views expressed on the apaurusheyatvam of Vedas in a VidvatsabhA. Given below are the links (thanks to Sri Kommu Dakshniamurthy for pointingthem).

This is the link, where Br. Sri Ve. Mu. Visvanatha Gopalakrishna Sastri garu (from 00:00:50 to 00:02:00) talks about NyAya proposing ISvara as creator of Veda to convince non-believers: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yze5fCnXLP8&list=UUfdpE7nAhRjF_sFieANgisw. 

Later Jagadguru Sri Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Swamiji in his anugrahabhAshaNam spoke of Veda as ISvaraniSSvasitam at about 00:18:00 in this link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISDnD6lFmHA&list=UUfdpE7nAhRjF_sFieANgisw

The speeches are mainlyin Telugu, with some starting in Sanskrit before switching to Telugu - except for Sriman Tatacharya's inaugural speech which was completely in Saskrit (he spoke in Telugu while concluding).

Best regards
N. Siva Senani
