praNAms Sri Sunil prabhuji

You are good tArkik and there is no doubt. Will you not like to say a word 
on "kutarka" and "sutarka" ? Is it decided only on the quality of the 
tarka or on the spirit of the tarka as well ?

>  If one approach this subject without any subjective or sentimental 
attachment to the sAmpradAyik stand or shAstri statements, he would 
definitely get the doubts like this.  We cannot label it as kutarka just 
because we donot have any logical answer to his doubts. 

Secondly if the apaurusheyatva has been seen under the yogic state, will 
be possible to utilise common logic to decide on the apaurusheyatva ?

>  If the apaurusheyatva of the veda-s is like the 'special' and 
supernatural revelation of some people in yOgic state, then definitely I 
would agree that it is not for common logical deliberations. But that is 
not the case here, here we are using the pramANa like anupalabdhi to prove 
the veda's apaurusheyatva and this pramANa is the technique of some 
parusheya granTha-s which is not anyway a 'defect-free' work like shruti 
:-)) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
