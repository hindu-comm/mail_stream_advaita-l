As I have repeatedly said, let us not bother about the outsiders. Ishwara
will take care of them.  Since it is no problem for both of us, we shall 
go
the way our elders have gone.  At least for me, it was as natural as fish
taking to water.  So is it with the millions of astika-s.

Thanks for your patience and clarification.  As I said earlier, if we, 
both, are standing under the same vedic umbrella, there is no need for any 
discussion on aparusheyatva vAda.  Nor I would  be asking for any pramANa 
to prove that aparusheyatva.  A simple clarification from our bhagavatpAda 
or any traditionally respected Acharya about veda nityatva and 
apaurusheyatva would be enough for me accept it and  to restrict myself 
from asking further question.  Questions & doubts arise once you come out 
of that traditional box & started looking at it as  an outsider, that is 
what I did by assuming the role of devil's advocate !!  Anyway, it pinches 
me somewhere that I cannot take my sAmpradAyik stand on aparusheyatva of 
veda-s to outside to show the supremacy of my shAstra over other religious 
texts and works. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
