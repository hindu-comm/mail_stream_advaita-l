It is precisely because one habitually experiences and defines
onself in terms of the not-self that the vast majority of people need 
something called Sruti.

But, IMHO, that shruti need not be necessarily should carry the tag of 
apaurusheyatva always  when this status is still open and has different 
interpretations among different schools of thought.  For that matter today 
majority of people donot have the adhikAra to pursue their sAdhana in veda 
mArga due to restrictions based on varNa.  So, those who donot have 
vedAdhikAra but eager to get mOksha  (ofcourse, every one will have 
mOkshAdhikAra irrespective of their caste and creed) can still get that 
paramArtha jnAna through 'paurusheya' smruti & purANa-s.  In this 
scenario, for mOksha/jnAna shruti is not an indispensable ultimate 
pramANa/ requisite.  Sri Subramanian prabhuji, sometime back, argued this 
point and emphasized that an uttama adhikAri can/would get this Atma jnAna 
just by reading even a novel which asserts 'ekatva'.  So, shruti as a 
sacred text irrespective of whether it has author (s) or otherwise would 
still serve the purpose for the sAdhaka-s (vaidika-s) in veda mArga.  And 
likewise texts like smruti & other paurusheya texts too would serve the 
same purpose  for those who donot have adhikAra to study the veda-s. 

Do we have any problem if we approach veda-s in this way prabhuji?? kindly 
clarify.

Your Humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
