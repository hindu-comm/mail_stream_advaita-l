praNAms Sri Sunil prabhuji
Hare Krishna

In fact the Puranas also are Veda as that is the fifth Veda and before 
Vedavyasa divided the Vedas all were known as one Veda, the Yajur Veda. So 
your following contention is not valid. Originally all four Vedas and the 
puranas were one Veda. 

>  So that means the eighteen purANa-s which are popularly known as 
vyAsakruta paurusheya too veda-s only so they too apaurusheya.  I did not 
know that before division of veda-s and purANa-s, the 'whole' text was 
called 'yajurveda'!!  From where did you get this information prabhuji, 
kindly give me the reference.  OTOH, there is a talk that 'agewise' 
Rigveda has been considered as oldest,  I am first time hearing that 
yajurveda was containing all the four veda-s & purANa-s too before 
division by vyAsa. 

Let us be honest and not compromise for the sake of convenience in 
interpreting the term "Apaurusheya". The Veda has 33 devas and Vishnu is 
the Parampada but do you have anyone else than the Brahman in Vedanta? 

>  atharvaNi sUryOpanishat, gaNeshArthavasheershaM, mAhAnArAyaNa 
upanishat, rudrOpanishat etc. explains how sUrya, gaNesha, rudra etc. are 
satchidAnandAdviteeya and para brahma..Anyway, I am not clear what exactly 
you are trying to convey here??

Vedic teaching is for the four purusharthas and Moksha there does not 
necessarily mean going out the cycle of birth and death. 

>  !! ??  mOksha is not necessarily mean going out of the cycle of birth 
and death?? do you really mean this prabhuji??

But the true Vedantic teaching, as derived from the Mahavakyas, is 
achieving the oneness with the Brahman.

>  Yes, that is what is called 'punarAvrutti' rahita, nitya shuddha, 
buddha, mukta ekaika svarUpa.  Oneness with the brahman invariably means 
the emancipation from the cycle of birth and death.


Finally everyone of the  spiritual aspirants will  have to leave the texts 
of Veda, Vedanta, the Sanakarabhashyas etc. behind and only one's 
understanding would help one to realize the oneness with the Brahman.

>  Yes, I agree with it, for that matter even bandha-mOksha have validity 
only in avidyA vyavahAra kshetra..

>  But you have not clarified my doubt yet, i.e. difference between veda & 
vedAnta & the applicability of apaurusheyatva to these texts. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
