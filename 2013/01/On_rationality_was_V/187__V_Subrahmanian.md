We must recognize that the Veda is not a commodity available for
marketing.  And apauruSheyatva is not a marketing strategy.  The Veda
itself does not need such marketing.  The adherents of the Veda are already
there, naturally born into it.  And that the very nature of the Veda is
that:  'if it is Veda then it is apaurusheya.  If there is an author then
it is not veda.'  apaurusheyatva is an inseparable attribute of Veda.  That
is the way the tradition holds it.

That is easy for us.  For example Sureshwaracharya has cited two verses
from the AgamaprakaraNa in the Naishkarmyasiddhi and explicitly stated that
it is told by Gaudapada.  Another 12th Century commentator
AnubhUtisvarUpAchArya has explicitly said that these shlokas are composed
by (GaudapAda) AchArya.  Recently there was a discussion in the BVP on this
very topic. In the case of Dvaitins It is the way their mUlAchArya has
received the text and commented on it.  Despite Vidyaranya and Appayya
Dikshita and, a little doubtfully, Madhusudana Saraswati have cited certain
verses of the kArikA as shruti, the tradition in Advaita is always, to this
day, that the first chapter consists of twelve mantras of the
Mandukyopanishad and the rest are kaarikA-s. That is how a traditional
Acharya would teach.

Now, unwittingly you have ended up using the anupalabdhi pramANa to
prove/suggest that Shankara has not mentioned it : ) That only shows that
in any thinking discourse the pramanas such as pratyaksha, anumana,
upamana, arthApatti and anupalabdhi are inevitable/indispensable, whichever
school one belongs to. One might try to group under anumana the other
three.  But even then while examining each case of anubhava one will have
to encounter the uniqueness involved in each of the pramanas grouped under
anumana and treat it that way alone.  Dr. Mani Dravid SastrigaL
demonstrated to me one day as to how it is impossible to deal with
arthApatti, for instance, by bypassing the unique feature it has, in trying
to explain it by means of anumAna.

That it can give moksha is not denied, though.

As I said above, the outsiders are not the concern of the Veda.  They need
not come to the Veda; they can happily opt to stay out.  No one is bothered
about their staying out.

As I have repeatedly said, let us not bother about the outsiders. Ishwara
will take care of them.  Since it is no problem for both of us, we shall go
the way our elders have gone.  At least for me, it was as natural as fish
taking to water.  So is it with the millions of astika-s.

We must remember that no pramANa acts in complete isolation of the others.
That is why we have the key element: shraddhA in guru and shAstra vAkyam.
If this fundamental requirement is missing there is no progress, not just
in vedanta, even in worldly matters.

I think you are missing the point.  Anupalabdhi is not any person's
invention. It is ever present in all walks of life.  It is like the law of
gravitation, ever present, only discovered and stated in cogent terms for
our own better understanding of nature. The Chandogya 6th ch. 12 sec.
mantra 1 and 2 can be seen as an example.  That the mUlakAraNam, Sat, is
extremely subtle, sUkShmam, and not sthUla, is demonstrated with the help
of the experiment on the banyan seed.  When the minute grain inside the
fruit is broken, Shvetaketu is asked 'what do you see?' He replies that he
does not see anything there.  But actually it is that apparent nothing that
is at the causal root of the huge banyan tree.  The idea is: if the cause
had been gross, it would have been perceived.  But since it is not seen, it
is concluded that it is subtle.

Shruti need not assert everything; it is enough that it provides implicit
indications.  It is for the sampradayavit-s to identify them and pass them
on to their disciples.

 So, for proving veda-s apaurusheyatva we are using the theory called

As I have pointed out in the foregoing, anupalabdhi pramana is not anyone's
introduction/invention.  If you recognize this, all your other misgivings
about the topic will simply vanish.  You will start appreciating how there
is no anyonyAshrayadoSha involved here but only a pUraka/poShaka bhAva  or
a pratijnA - dRShTAnta bhAva that is there.
