RV: it is fortunate or perhaps beyond fortune and misfortune (subhAsubhau)
in your case because your objective is Atma jnAnA. The statements such as
"tat tvam asi" are true as they are not controverted. Also, the statements
that teach the methods to remove ajnAna given are true to start with.

So, the theory that a statement is true until it is refuted is valid not
only in the case of yajnas but also in the case of brahma jnAnA.
