praNAms Sri Rajaram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

You experience sorrow. How do you know without shruti that your nature is 
ananda? 

> some of the paurusheya texts too (like geeta) teaching us that our true 
nature is Ananda or dvandvAteeta. 

Even if you say I know it by understanding that sorrow is related to 
objects such as the mind, how do you know you, the self, will not die. 

>  again paurusheya texts like geeta (na hanyate hanyamAne shareere, dehee 
nityamavadhOyaM, vAsAmsi jeerNAsi yatho vihAya)too teaches us self will 
not die, why we should depend on shruti to know all these details that too 
pasting the label of aparusheyatva on it??  If the sAdhaka/mumukshu find 
the same tattva in paurusheya smruti texts and realized his svarUpa, can 
he not attain mOksha even knowing that there exist some un authored texts 
like veda-s?? 

If you say some great man said so or ishwara, how do you know someone is 
great or ishwara? You want to be an advaitin (or any vaidhika) you got to 
understand and accept veda apauresheya. 

>  I am at loss to understand why a vaidhika has to invariably treat 
veda-s as apaurusheya when he is equally treating the other two 
prasthAna-s (smruti & nyAya) as valid & sacred. Dont we see the vAkyArtha 
of shruti will be done on paurusheya nyAya prasthAna & commentaries on it 
??  It has been said that for the mumukshu-s who donot have vedAdhikAra, 
the smruti and purANa texts would suffice to fetch the mOksha jnAna, so 
for them vedA-s, its uncontional acceptance of aparusheyatva, its 
importance etc. hardly a matter of concern.  Under these circumstances, 
how can we force one to accept the aparusheyatva of veda-s and its 
ultimate parmAnatva for the mOksha jnAna?? 

You can learn every thing from pauresheya texts but their validity is 
dependent on apauresheya veda. Moon light is a reflection of sun's light. 
It may be cooler but it can't exist without sun light. 

>  IMHO, for that one need not have to treat vedA-s as apaurusheya, we can 
always infer that the veda-s are like main text book and  smruti and other 
texts are the digestive form of these original text books!! is there any 
harm in treating both of them as paurusheya texts ?? 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
