Sir:  My statement was in regard to Atma jnAna where you can verify the
truth of Shruti's declarations right here in your experience.

You seem to have some other goals in mind, which I did not realize.

are attained through yajna. So it seems that we were talking about two
different things. Sorry to interrupt in your discussion.
