>From the Vedic angle one has to accept the apaurusheyatva only as a 
hypothesis and this hypothesis cannot be challenged.  However from the 
Vedantic angle the situation is different.

Kindly pardon me, I am not able to get it properly !!  It seems to me you 
are differentiating veda-s from vedAnta, but traditionally vedAnta 
(upanishads) forms the part of veda-s only and it is not a separate set of 
texts, hence it is called vedAnta.  Could you please elaborate the 
difference between veda and vedAnta here while taking the stance on 
apaurusheyatva of these texts. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!
