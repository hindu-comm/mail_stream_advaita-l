This is what the article says:-
" It may be noted that as many as 35 mathas find a mention in (page
number 22-24) Sharirik Mimansa tika (chapter) of Brhamsutra Shankar
Bhasya (commentary on Vedic literature by Adi Shankaracharya).

Seven of them are listed in the principal category. These include:
Sumeru Math in Kashi (Varanasi), Uttar Pradesh, Sringeri Sharada
Peetham in Chickmagalur Karnataka, Jyotirmath (also known as
Joshimath) in Badrinath, Uttrakhand, Sarvagya Math in Shrinagar,
Kashmir, Shardapith math in Dwarka, Gujarat, Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham,
Kanchipuram Tamil Nadu and Govardhan Math, Puri Orissa."

Apart from the four Amnayas,these muttsa were started as branch mutts.

Could someone confirm this from the Sharirika mimamsa tika?

In my reply the above posting must read as:
Apart from the four Amnayas,these mutts were started as branch mutts.
There is no mention of these mutts in the Sharirika mimamsa tika?Infact we donot see such a mention in any grantha.
