नायमात्मा प्रवचनेन लभ्यो न मेधया *न बहुनाश्रुतेन* । यमेवैष वृणुते तेन
लभ्यस्तस्यैष आत्मा विवृणुते तनुं स्वाम्॥

//23 This Atman cannot be attained by the study of the Vedas, or by
intelligence, or by much hearing of sacred books. It is attained by him
alone whom It chooses. To such a one Atman reveals Its own form. //
____________________________________________________________________________________
The above mantra from the Mundaka Upanishath also means:
This Atman cannot be attained by the study of the Vedas,or by intelligence,or by much hearing of sacred books.This Atman reveals its form(vivrunute) to him alone who "yearns"(vrunute)by his whole heart.
"Brahma Jnana"is not for a one whom the "Atman"chooses,because the Nirguna Brahman cannot choose one and neglect the others.The "Atman"is revealed to one who constantly"yearns"to see the "Atman".This meaning is the apt one for the above mantra of the Mundaka Upanishath.
N.Srikanta.
