>  Yes, we can always  say veda-s are the source  material for the 
smruti-s, but it does not mean veda-s has to be aparusheya to become the 
source material!!  An apex court case study & verdict could be the 
reference material for the lower courts while clearing the pending cases 
and giving the judgement. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

There is something called natural jurisprudence even in legal terminology!
