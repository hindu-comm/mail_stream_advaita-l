freedom from prakRti for both the jIvAtman and the paramAtman.  They admit
the jiva-s to be saattvika or rAjasika or tAmasika as the very svarUpa.
That shows that these jIva-s can never be free from the guNa-s of prakRti
which the scripture enjoins upon the jiva to work for.  Also the paramAtman
too is endowed with the guNas since He is admitted to be the
sRShTi-sthiti-samhAra kartA and named LakShmInArAyaNa.  There is no way the
Lord is free from prakRti named Lakshmi.  In  some vaishnavite sampradayas
it is a sin to separate Lakshmi from Narayana.  Rajas, sattvam and tamas
are the guNa-s that enable paramAtman to engage in creation,sustenance and
dissolution. And this function is inalienable from the paramAtman as it is
His svarUpalakShaNa.  Thus in the dualistic systems both the jIvatman and
the paramAtman cannot be admitted to be free from prakRti.  It is only in
Advaita the jIva and Ishwara are guNa-attributed  in an aupAdhic manner and
not at the svarUpa level.  When the ajnAna/mAyA-born upAdhis are negated
what remains is the One Pure Consciousness that is ever free of any of the
guNa-s of prakRti.  The scriptural exhortation to remain free from prakRti
is possible in Advaita alone. There is no room for aprAkRtha guNa-s
either.  For, any guNa is invariably a product of either one or the
combination of  sattva, rajas and tamas of mAyA/prakRti. And it is crucial
for those systems to be so as duality/difference can be retained/maintained
at all states, in bondage as well as in liberation, only when guNa-s are
admitted and not otherwise.
