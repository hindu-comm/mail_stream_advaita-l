Please ask the purohits about the kalasha-puja.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Panchayatana Puja

Dear Members,


As a part of Panchayatana Puja, can we use idols or murthis instead.
I stay abroad, and many purohits opined that salagrama and other stones
should be used with in Bharatha Kanda, so I have to drop that.
Please give your insight.

Thanks,
Harsha
