Hare Krishna

One of my Ritvik colleagues, wants to learn krishna yajurveda saMhita 
maNtra-s through Skype software in computer...He knows some upayukta 
prayOga maNtra-s & sUkta-s, but wanted to learn the mUla.  Is anybody 
there to teach him??  BTW, he goes to temple (is a priest there) every 
morning and evening, after-noon, he said he is free to learn. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
