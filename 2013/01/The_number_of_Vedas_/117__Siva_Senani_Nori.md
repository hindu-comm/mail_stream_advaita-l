In another thread, the argument that there wereonly three Vedas initially, as exemplified by numerous utterances,and the Atharvana Veda has been'added' laterhas been mentioned.

The utterances about Rigyajussaama are numerous (even in Ramayana, in Aditya Hridayam) as is the word trayeevidyaa (for Vedas), or even plain trayee. If Atharva(na) Veda were a later addition, its PramaaNyataa and in its wake, that of the entire Veda comes into question. 

I had asked one scholar Br. Sri. Vedamurtulu Kuppa Siva Subrahmanyaavadhaani garu three or four years back, when he was the principal of the VedapaaThaSaala at Keesaragutta, Hyderabad(run by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam) when he spoke on a related topic at Sanskrit Academy, Hyderabadand his answer was that there are three kinds of Vedic mantras- Rik, Saaman andYajus. The first one is the name given to mantras whose primary characteristic is eulogy or praise; the second, to the those whose primary characteristic is that they are sung; and the, third to those which are employed in a Yajna. Whenever reference ismade to the 'three', it is to be understoodas reference to the type of Vedamantras. Each Veda may have mantras of any onetype or more. The Atharva Veda primarily consists on Riks.
