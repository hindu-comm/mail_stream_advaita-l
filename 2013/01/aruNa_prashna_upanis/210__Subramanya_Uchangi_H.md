Dear leaned Advaitins

I am a simple sadhaka and not an expert on these  'vidhis' and 'Nishedhas'.
I am still a student of Vedanta. However,

In my opinion the rules for chanting by time reference is made by some
Sampradaya Mimamsakas. These are' vaidika vyavaharas'. According to Adhyasa
bhashya of Shankara, these notions are 'Adhyasa' only.

It is enough if we understand the meanings and tattvas(principles)
underlying in these mantras, No time restriction should be followed. From
the stand point of a Jnani or paramatha, there is no time frame at all.
There is no day and night for Sun.  Shankara quotes in Chandogya Bhashya "
udayascha nama savitustannivasinaam praNinaam chakshurgocharaapatti
tadatyayascha astamanam. na paramarthathah UDAYASTAMANE stah". Really there
is no udaya and astamana for SUN from the standpoint of paramartha. But
still we use Sun rise and sun set time etc.. From the standpoint of earth,
the day and nights are vyavaharas only.

There are similar  restrictions on chanting Veda mantras by Ladies

The Mantras referred may contain Stutis, vidhi or Nishedha. What is
preventing stuti of Paramatma at any time? What prevents one from following
Injunctions at any time?

I request the learned vedantins to highlight on this.
Regards
Subramanya UH
