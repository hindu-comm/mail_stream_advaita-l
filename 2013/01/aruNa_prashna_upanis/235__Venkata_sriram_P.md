//
without using artha-vaada
//

My acharya Br.Sri. Narendra Kapreji clarified this vAkya saying that this should 
not be taken as arthavAda prayoga.

The word "swAdhyAya" should be taken as vyApaka artha which includes
vedAnga, purANa, itihAsa etc. 

So, when purANa, itihAsa etc. are taken as a part of swAdhyAya, there are no desha, kAla ityAdi niyamAs. However, with respect to brahmayajna which too falls into 
the gamut of swAdhyAya, vidhi & nisheda should be observed w.r.t kAla.

regs,
sriram
