To my knowledge shruti vAkya cannot be recited after sunset, this is the
tradition of Sandipani Vidyaniketan in Gujarata, where sAyaMa sandhyA
upAsana is the final vedokta upasanA that is done.

However saying this once whilst I was in vraj, I saw students studying Veda
in the evening after sunset.

My conclusion: Veda cannot be recited after sunset but abhyAsa is
permissable.
