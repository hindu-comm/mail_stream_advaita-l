Hello,

My thought process was as follows:

1. the apuurva vidhi for svaadhyaaya is svaadhyaayo adhyetavyaH, so
statements found in smR^iti and shiShTaachaara about "in the morning",
"recite when clean", etc., cannot be apuurva vidhi, but possibly only
guNa vidhi, i.e., specifying accessories
2. But given the explicit statement in shruti about "sitting",
"standing", "relaxed", "lying down", etc., it cannot be that either,
so it has to be arthavaada praising one pointedness of mind while
reciting.

Not learning new lessons during prathmai, aShTami, etc., is different
since the yajus does not talk about the *learning* (i.e., the first
lessons)  part, so smR^iti regarding these is authoritative as guNa
vidhi.

If you have any other way of interpreting without using artha-vaada
and not violating the principle of aanarthakhya, I would be happy to
hear it.

Rama
