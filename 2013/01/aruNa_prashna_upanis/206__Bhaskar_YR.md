My conclusion: Veda cannot be recited after sunset but abhyAsa is
permissable.

praNAms Sri Krunal prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Is this rule applicable also to the saMhita & brAhmaNa portions of veda-s 
prabhuji??  And also clarify in mahAnArAyaNa upanishad we find sUkta-s 
like durga, nArAyaNa etc. and sadyOjAtAdi pancha maNtra-s which we are 
chanting during pradOsha pooja & shivarAtri pooja etc. Strictly speaking 
since these maNtra-s are part of the upanishad maNtra-s we should not 
chant it after sunset.. Is this practice observed anywhere prabhuji??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
