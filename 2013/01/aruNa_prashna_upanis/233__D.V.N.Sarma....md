I do not see why one wearing shirt and pants cannot recite vedas.
yajnopavita is essential. Dress code for Brahmins is not the same
as obtained at present in India. In northern India in the colder regions
brahmins do wear shirts or sweaters out of necessity.

We seem to forget or desparately try to forget that the sanatana dharma was
practiced by beef eating brahmins.
