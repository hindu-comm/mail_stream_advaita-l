To which, let me add the following couple of points.

1. There is no rule that those who follow Apastambha sUtra-s are prohibited from
taking on elements from bodhAyana or ASvalAyana sUtra-s or vice versa. For that
matter, there really were dvi-vedI-s, tri-vedI-s and catur-vedI-s in the past, who had
multiple choices of sUtrakAra-s to follow for different purposes. It was also quite
possible that someone could learn an Apastambha practice from a father and an
ASvalAyana practice from a maternal uncle at different times in one's life. Nothing
here that should be a matter of concern in any way.

2. Oftentimes, the veda itself explicitly allows a lot of variation. Since this thread is
partly about adhyayana and started with the aruNa praSna, let me draw attention to
the last passage in it, where the dakshiNA to the teacher is specified - "kaMsaM vAsaS
ca kshaumam. anyad vA Suklam. yathASakti vA." Here, within a small detail of what
the student is supposed to offer as a ritual dakshiNA, there is a lot of latitude. One
finds this "yathASakti" allowance in numerous places throughout the ritual texts. A
similar flexibility is made in many other ritual details.

Vidyasankar
