I do not know about any rules, but the practice that I have observed is 
that Aruna praSna and Upanishads are recited only before eating lunch. 

praNAms Sri SivasenAni Nori prabhuji 
Hare Krishna

Thanks for the clarification.  But as you know, the udaka shAnti maNtra-s 
like kruNushvapAja paNcha maNtra-s, devi, nakshatra, gO bhAgya sUkta-s 
etc. are veda saMhita maNtra-s but here in South India, most of the time 
will be chanted during evening times, In SrivaishNava-s (especially 
IyengAr-s) they prefer to chant the udaka shAnti in the evening time of 
previous day of the main function like upanayanaM, gruha praveshaM etc. 
:-))  Very strange our practices is it not??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
