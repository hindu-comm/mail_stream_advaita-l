Namaste ramakrishnanji,

So such statements are an arthavaada for making the mind one pointed to
get the maximum benefit

Good post.

"shrutitdvidhan tu yastrastyAt tatra dharmAvubhausmrutA" ie., when viruddha in shruti-vAkya is seen, both should be accepted as per adhikAra lakSaNa. 

It is something similar to the vAkya *ahar-ahar sandhyAM upAsIta*. 

Even though sandhyA-kAla is only 3, with the sandhyavandanain 3 kAlAs, the objective is to attain such a state of upAsanawhich continues*taila dhAravat*. 

However, arthavaada may not be the right choice to use here. 

regs,
sriram
