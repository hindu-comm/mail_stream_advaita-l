I was bit worried   because sometimes if I dont get 
sleep at night  I try to recall some veda maNtra-s 
by-heart, if I dont get it,   straight-away from the 
bed I go to my reading room and open the book and 
refer the relevant maNtra and try to memorize that 
maNtra by repetition.  Now, I can do that exercise 
without any doubt in my mind

On a lighter vein :))

That doesn’t mean that one can chant & refer the 
veda mantras by wearing Bermudas & while answering 
calls of nature.

The same Upanishad which details out the
Vidhi & nishEda of swAdhyAya says:

tasya vA Etasya yajnasya dvA vanadhyAyau 
yadAtmAshuchirya ddEshaH

The place of swAdhyAya should be free from
the doshas of mUtra & purISa and other
ashuchi padArthAs.

The relaxation of the rules of vidhi & nishedha
for svAdhyAya in general and brahma yajna in
particular is because of *saulabhya* where
the objective should be “dEvata tripti” (vide:
samruddhir daivatAni….) which results in
paramapurushArtha siddhi.

Regs,
sriram
