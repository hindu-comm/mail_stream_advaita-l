Bhaskar,

Your comments below are extremely surprising, to say the least. From the very beginning,
the vaidika tradition is full of diversity. There are customs specific to the specialists in each
veda.  Then, there are customs specific to the adherents of different sUtra-s within a given
veda. On top of it, there are practices that are specific to region and perhaps even to a given
village, depending on the individual histories of the people there. A lot of times, "this is how
my guru taught me," is more than enough to validate the variation in practices. It is only to
accommodate the need for adjusting as per circumstances that we allow SishTAcAra as a
validating principle in itself and charge the SishTa-s with the responsibility of not violating
fundamental Srauta injunctions. This situation can give rise to doubts, sure, but again, that
is why, there is the upanishadic teaching that says "ye tatra brAhmaNAs sammarSinaH ..
 tathA tatra/teshu vartethAH". And there are later dharmaSAstra texts that point to the
customs of the learned in specific regions (AryAvarta/brahmAvarta/madhyadesha etc) as
the best. 

We should celebrate this diversity. It is not "unfortunate", by any means. All that is required
of a specific person is to understand and apply the rules as they apply to the specific situation.
And precisely because of the diversity intrinsic to our traditions, from the earliest times, there
is a lot of room to adapt and honor the spirit of the rules, even if not observing them to the
letter.

Expecting a "one size fits all" approach to our traditions is totally alien to our general outlook.
It is a sign of the increasing alienation of the Indian mind from our true roots. Nothing in the
variety of styles of reciting the vedas can invalidate a philosophical outlook regarding their
pramANatva. And nothing in the various regional variations in customs among vaidika-s can 
invalidate the status we give the vedas either.

Vidyasankar
