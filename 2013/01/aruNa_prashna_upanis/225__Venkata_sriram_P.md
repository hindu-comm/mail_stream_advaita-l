Namaste,
This restriction is for aruNa praSNa. It should be chanted early hours in the morning. The chanting of aruNa praSNa can be continued in the morning before having breakfast /lunch. 
As regards other veda mantra bhAga, the pArAyaNa can be performed on the 1st & 4th yAmA of the night (the night is divided into 4 equal intervals called 4 yAmAs). This is thepramANa showed in dharma sindhu. It is said that one should not chant theveda during 2nd & 3rd yAmA of the night as it is the nishAchara-sanchAra ghaDiya.
regs,sriram
