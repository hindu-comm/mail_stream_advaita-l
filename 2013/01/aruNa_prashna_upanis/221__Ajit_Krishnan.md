namaste,

Many of us have some amount of experience with practical prayogas. Being in
the west, some of us interact with shishtas from various regions. Where you
focus on the minute external differences, some of us have noticed that all
of these variations stem from a common core -- it is that inviolate core,
the spirit of these rituals -- that is sacrocanct.

I am not trying to diminish the importance of the sutras, or the sutra
karakas, but sutras are not shruti.

The survival of the veda mArga is not dependent on whether or not followers
of apastamba perform Achamana with acyutAdi nAmas or keshavAdi nAmas.

Why? The spirit of the karma is there in all the various traditions. When
followers of apastamba discard some karmas specified by him, and take up
different karmas specified by a different sutrakAra, simply because they
felt like it, there may be some concern. But, when one substitutes a
dhyAna-shloka for agni from the AshvalAyana sUtra in place of something
similar from Apastamba (perhaps because the adherent has close contact with
AshvalAyana followers, or because the adherent found the dhyAna shloka to
enhance his own performance), I see only a cause to celebrate.

Quite frankly, what "worries" me much more is literal adherence to the
sUtras, where we spend 25 minutes in agnimukha and jayAdi homa etc with
only a token handful of offerings in the pradhAna homa. Here, the spirit of
the performance is pretty much non-existant.

sasneham,

   ajit
