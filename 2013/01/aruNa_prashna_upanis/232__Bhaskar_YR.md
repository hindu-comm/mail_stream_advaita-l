praNAms Sri Ram prabhuj
Hare Krishna

On a lighter vein :))

That doesnâ€™t mean that one can chant & refer the 
veda mantras by wearing Bermudas & while answering 
calls of nature.

>  I wear panche (dhOti) & t-shirt,  so bermudas is out of question :-)) 
By the way, is there any specific dress code while chanting veda-s or for 
doing vedAbhyAsa??  I've seen in Sai baba mandira and at some places (like 
in satyanArAyaNa pooja etc.) people wearing pants & shirts would join us 
in vedic recitation during maNtra pushpa or whenever they hear some 
familiar maNtra-s.  Can they join us (ritviks) like that prabhuji??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
