I want to clarify that the discussion on the above topic has been mixed up.The first part quoted by you is by Sri Kuntimuddi Sadananda.My view has been expressed in later.
Understanding is with objectification.We have not seen anything without objectification.The moment we see undestand,it is with reference to an object.
