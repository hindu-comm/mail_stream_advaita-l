Namaste,

Since Jaimini-sutra 1.1.29-30 had already dealt with this subject, is there any need to discuss this topic with the people, who are unable (or pretending to be unable) to understand what Jaimini had told several thousand years ago.

Regards,
Sunil KB

You should appreciate that it is not 'blindly' accepting something even if
it is within the tradition. That is why there is enough space for
'mananam' which has logic for its content. It should be within the
parameters of sampradaya at the same time. That logic is used in helping
the one within the tradition who has a question or doubt is not at all
disputed. That is why those questions like 'show me the author' are used.
The pramANa of anupalabdhi substantiated by the various instances from
within the shruti is employed.

By the way, there is an event coming up in Hyderabad on this very topic of
'apauruSheyatvam' mostly in the first week of March 2013. Dr,Mani Dravid
SastrigaL is likely to be there. It is organized by a Madhwa institution.
When the confirmed dates and speakers list are available I shall notify
this forum.
