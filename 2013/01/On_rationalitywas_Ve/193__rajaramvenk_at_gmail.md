Advaitins have it also. Mani Dravid Sastrigal spent 3 hours explaining this to me. It seemed clear then but am unable to counter some of the arguments from kalavai and kk on my blog. I am taking the opponent's views away to do my home work. I'm always thanks to my critics because they end up improving my understanding.

As far as I know there is no effort in any classical Advaitic texts
(excluding modern texts) on elaborated arguments defending apouruShEyatvaM.
May be I am wrong.
