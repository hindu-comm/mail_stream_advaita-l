Please let us know what those traditional scholars (about whom you are referring to) think of Lord Krishna's statement in the Mahabharata that he gave the discourse on the Bhagavad Gita, while he was yogayukta. 

Please also let us know as to what do they think of the Vishvarupa-darshana in the Chapter 11 in the Bhagavad Gita. Do they say it is all bunkum? 

Please do not come back saying that you have not seen any relation of these questions with the current topic of the apaurusheyatva of the Vedas.Apaurusheyatva of the Veda.

Extremely well said. On my blog, there are genuine non-traditional scholars who make logical arguments against apauresheyatva. It takes my time to respond to them but I'm not saddened by it. However, when "traditional scholars" caricature (good choice of word) apauresheyatva as a mere belief system, it is worrying to see where we have landed. Even those who are recognised teachers say things like vedas are intuition of the rishis. It seems we don't read and understand our system. 

Like other religions, our teachers stress on sraddha. But our sraddha is based on irrefutable nature of true statements. Sanatana dharma is not a blind belief system - a marked difference we fail to note.

Neither. I am surprised that you have not realized that Advaita holds the
Veda to be apaurusheya on the anupalabdhi pramANam and note that it is not
a 'belief system' as you have been caricaturing it. And also note that the
Sringeri Acharya who wrote those lines has not excluded himself from the
other puruSha authors. And our regarding the pUrvAchArya-s and other
smRtikAra-s as venerable ones is only because at the base of their
greatness lies the Veda that is the source of all their accomplishment.
That point is also implied in the Acharya's lines that I cited.
