Sri Ramesh Krishnamurthy,

Namaste. My responses are given in-line starting with an asterisk.

>* The obliqueness of the post was intentional because most times direct engagement seems to quickly descend into a heated and lengthy exchange generating a lot of heat but very little light. To tell you the truth, this looks like the beginning of one; however, let me see if I canmake my point without hurting you,provoking you, making any personal comments or otherwise being sarcastic or caustic.

>
>* A general statement has to apply to a particular situation. If it has to be applied to Advaita, since the proposition (that an axiom is needed) was made by you, it is reasonable that you have to show how it applies to Advaita. I thought you would accept the theses of advaita and then show the axiom (I had also suggested that SraddhA in Veda be that axiom), but you seem to have taken the stance that either since a) you do not see an axiom /there is no axiom, there is no thesis; or b) since Advaita has only anti-thesis, there is no question of showing that an axiom is required. The central crux would, then, be to see whether Advaita has theses or not.

>*If "most others" are non-Indian philosophoers, there might be some truth init; if "mostothers" are Indian philosophers, I think the above statement is not true. Every one of the 16 darSanas described in SarvadarSanasangraha emphasises Pramanas; Visishtadvaita has a primer dealing with Pramanas called Yateendramatadeepikaa; Bauddhas (DignAga) have written a book called PramaaNasamuccaya (with Dharmakirti writing a celebrated commentary on it, and within that different sections like apoha having their own sub-commentaries. According to Rahul Sankrityayan, Bauddhas wrote 1.4 lakh Slokas on this topic alone)

>* During the manana stage each one of us works out different ways to getting at the Truth. For instance, when one hears the statement "asau AdityaH brahma" a person might figure out that this is the same truth as represented by the law of conservation of mass-energy. During that stage, the reasoning looks very real. It is important, in my view, to be cautious about one aspect at this stage. It is perfectly alright to say what I say sounds reasonable; it might beincorrect to say no other way of representing Reality is correct (unless one has "seen" an apUrva Truth). So, while I have no issues with arriving at Brahman in the above way, I would submit that there are other "vidyAs" which teach Brahman (Each vidyaa, effectively, is one way of teaching and reaching Brahman).

>* With reference to the highlighted statement of yours above, I say Brahman is indeed pramANasiddham - the pramANam being the Veda, and this SAstrayonitvam, far from being a bAdhA is the only fact which establishes Brahman. Anubhava can reinforce that, but it is the Veda alone which establishes Brahman. This point has been made by BhagavatpAda in his bhAshyam under "tattu samanvayAt" (1.1.4), wherein the very first point of discussion ends with the assertion "tasmAtsiddham brahmaNaH SAstrapramANakatvam" (Swami Gambhirananda's translation: Therefore, it is proved that Brahman is known from the scriptures alone).

>
>* Why? That is exactly what a thesis or pratij~nA is: whatone proves based on certain facts using a certain method. anumAnam is a much discussed pramANa in Indian philosophy and its anga (subsidiary element)the thesis or pratij~nA (such as "parvato vahnimAn", "the mountain is fiery") is very famous. May be you mean a self-valid Truth by the word "thesis". Anyhow, I do understand that words keep taking new meanings based on the vaktA (that is why I had quoted a statement and its refutal as both being true in my earlier email) and am willing to look beyond lables.

>
>* You seem to be saying that any thing which gets a lable "thesis" needs an "axiom", but if it gets the lable "main points", it does not! That is not tenable. Whether they are "thesis" or "main points",there is no bAdhA to them (the main points)as shown by Sankaracharya in the prasthAnatrayee. If your point is that youagree with the content of the main points (as you have indeed done above) but you perceive a bAdha to them in the form of a depenence on an axiom,I submit that 'VedaprAmANyatA' be taken to be that axiom; Iwill also agree with you that without this crticial axiom, this system would not bevalid.I say so because there is indeed a system like Advaita, which does not depend on 'VedaprAmANyatA' - it is called Bauddham. And, as Kumarila, Udayana and BhagavatpAda have shown, that system is flawed.

>* Completely agree with youthat Sruti exists only to remove our avidyA; if the word "only" in the above sentence means that the purport of Veda is to teach Brahman by removing avidyA, it is fine; otherwise it misses the point that there is nothing else except Veda toperform this job. The medium - like a Guru - might be different, but ultimately this knowledge - or the deconditioning therapy - comesfrom Sruti alone and notanywhere else.
>
>* Inother words, the Atman cannot know itself to be theTruth, and as one with Brahman,without the help of Sruti.That is, Advaita is an exercise in exegesis, and is not a "logical system" removed from Sruti.
