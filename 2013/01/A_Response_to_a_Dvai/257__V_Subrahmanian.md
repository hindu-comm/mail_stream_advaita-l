In a very recently released book 'shatarudriyam' (a commentary in Sanskrit
on the famous srIrudram with several readings) the author, a renowned
scholar of the Dvaita school, Dr.Bannanje Govindacharya, has made some
remarks on Advaita/Advaitins.  A response to those remarks, in Sanskrit, is
available in the file uploaded here:

If and when time permits I shall render the entire response in English.
