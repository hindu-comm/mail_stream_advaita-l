Only Four mutts called "Amnayas"were installed by Adi shankaracharya.Sringeri,Puri,Dwaraka and Joshi Mutt.Who is this Sumeru Matadisha.We have not heard of it.Is there a proof for this?It is high time that the Sumeru mutt is stopped on this debate.It is not necessary that the Sringeri mutt should intervene on this.The devotes themselves can stop this.
N.Srikanta.
