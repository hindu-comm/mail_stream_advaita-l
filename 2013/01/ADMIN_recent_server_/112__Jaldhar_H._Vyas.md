Over the last week, the list server has been rather erratic, sometimes 
delivering mail to part of the membership, sometimes not at all.  I have 
investigated and there were some network issues which I think should be 
solved now.  All backlogged mail is being processed now so if you
don't see the message you posted, be patient.  If it still hasn't shown up 
by Monday it should be safe to resend.
