>Among the various darSana-s that worry about the veda, its apaurusheyatva is a concept unique to pUrva mImAMsA. As far as nyAya, vaiSeshika, sAMkhya, yoga and to some extent, vedAnta, are concerned, apaurusheyatva is not an invariable attribute of Sruti. Viewed in that light, apaurusheyatva of scripture is indeed a minority view within the larger religious context.
