There are differences between Aesop's fables and the Veda.  The Veda is the
source to know things supersensuous, atIndriya, like dharma/adharma, svarga
and above all, apavarga (Moksha).  These cannot be the imagination of a
person who can at best churn stories like the Panchatantra, involving
characters human and otherwise, inspired by human behaviour.  The Veda is
much greater than this.  No variety of human life can inspire one to think
of  mokSha.  In fact the very idea that one is bound, has re-birth, is
known from the Veda.
