RV: According to the Vedas, there is repeated re-discovery of the same
Vedas cycle after cycle.

RV: apauresheyatvam has nothing to do with nityatvam. Nyaya school
considers the vedas to pauresheya but nitya. Mimamsakas consider Vedas to
be apauresheya but nitya. Advaita Vedanta considers Vedas to be apauresheya
but not nitya (in the sense of being a vastu) because Vedas have origin at
the the of creation like any other created entity such as space. Advaita
Vedanta considers Vedas to be nitya in the sense of that the same
jnanapravaham or flow knowledge is there in every cycle of time.

RV: I also discuss this in my blog where members from other schools of
thought including nirishvara sankhya and atheistic scientists can express
their views. I also discuss with scholars from all schools of thought
privately  - for example with my teacher of gaudiya vaishnavam. So it is
not a "favour" that I extend to advaita list alone on account of my birth
in a smartha family. If there are good (traditional) scholars in other
lists like Subrahmanian, Vidyasankar, Jaldhar etc. to name a very few, I
will learn from through listening, discussing or debating. Often, I find
lists lacking in scholarship or openness to discuss views opposed to their
established beliefs but if you know others who are wise, please let me
know.
