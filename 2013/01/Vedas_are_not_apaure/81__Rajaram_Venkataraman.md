RV: If there are beliefs we always saw if the belief is valid or not,
dharmic or not. We included other schools of thought by accepting the
common good and rejecting the evil. I treat Bible or Quran as tamasic and
pauresheya, with a small p, sabda pramana negated by truth.

RV: I agree that we dont operate logically and one can find reasons though
all reasons may not be equally valid. Where can I findd references to
shruti over smrti logic from the perspective of advaita vedanta and other
darshanas?
