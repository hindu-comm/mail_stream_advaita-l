is: Brahman has no attributes that can be cognized through the five
senses.  But the Veda itself also teaches, Brahman has to be known through
the mind alone.  The Acharyas have clarified that  'Brahman is not
available for an unprepared mind but can certainly be apprehended by
employing the instrument, a duly cultivated mind.  Thus, the Self/Brahman
that is beyond perception can be 'known' with the due instrument in place.

By this I am not saying that all mantra draShTaa Rshis were aparoksha
jnanis.  What is required is a special capacity to receive the veda
mantra-s and not necessarily brahmajnAnitva.

Also, when mantras like 'aham brahmAsmi' are 'perceived' and 'given out'
there need not be an 'understanding' of the teaching.  It could be like a
newspaper reporter attending a science conference reporting on the talks
there even without himself understanding the nuances involved in the
subject.  This much alone is meant by 'riShi-pratyaksha'.
