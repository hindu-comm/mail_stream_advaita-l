While Vidyasankarji will reply to your mail, may I also respond to one particular point in your mail. That is as follows:

Where can I find references to shruti over smrti logic from the perspective of advaita vedanta and other
darshanas?
Unquote


I read (though I do not remember the reference off-hand) that the Smritis themselve claim that they are based on the Shruti and in the event of one finding (even if it is only in appearance) any difference between what the Shruti says and what the Smriti says, one is advised to follow the what the Shruti says.

RV: If there are beliefs we always saw if the belief is valid or not,
dharmic or not. We included other schools of thought by accepting the
common good and rejecting the evil. I treat Bible or Quran as tamasic and
pauresheya, with a small p, sabda pramana negated by truth.

RV: I agree that we dont operate logically and one can find reasons though
all reasons may not be equally valid. Where can I findd references to
shruti over smrti logic from the perspective of advaita vedanta and other
darshanas?
