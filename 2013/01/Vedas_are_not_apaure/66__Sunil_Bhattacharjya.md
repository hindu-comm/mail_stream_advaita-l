Just compare the difference between the Shruti and the Smriti with the difference between the research papers on one hand and the text books on the other (both dealing with the same subject). The Shruti includes the original texts and the Smritis are the derived texts.

I meant one set (smrti) pauresheya while calling others (shruti) apauresheya.

If only sharaddha is required, then Jaimini, Sabara, Kumarila and Prabhakara would not have defended apauresheyam using logic. 

If every knowledge is apauresheya, then the tradition need not specifically call one set pauresheya while calling others (smrti) apauresheya. 

As to show me the author, Kalavai has given sarvanukramani as the evidence where rishis are recorded as the authors. 

The fact is we don't have proper defence for this ancient belief and I think we should work on it in the interest of dharma and satyam instead creating a cult.

OM
Any number of counter arguments can be imagined, quoted and
argued!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What is the basic requirement is SHRADDA and if this is not there then
ADVAITAM can never be understood!!!
