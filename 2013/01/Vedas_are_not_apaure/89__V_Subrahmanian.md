During a recent interaction with the eminent scholar/thinker Vidwan Mani
Dravid SastrigaL at Tumkur during the meet on The Contributions of Sri
Vidyaranya, I broached the above topic.  He said:  If anyone were to ask me
on this, I would say: Supposing we admit someone to be the author of the
Veda.  The immediate question would be 'how / from where did he know?'
For, in respect of anything that we are informed/taught, etc. in the world
we ask to or seek to know as to who or what is the source of that person
('s knowledge)  who informs/teaches us.  Sometimes we may not ask this
question taking for granted like for example in a newspaper report from a
reporter.  But by and large we do try to find out the source of that
person's knowledge of that subject.  In this case, we will have to specify
as to from where or whom this 'author' of the Veda knew.  Then one will
have to invariably end up at the Ishwara level tracking the trail
backwards.  So 'due to the anugraha of Ishwara certain persons got to know
of the contents of the Veda and from them the world.'

One should not conclude from the above that Ishwara is the author.  No,
what is meant is that Ishwara is the source from whom this, that has ever
been in existence, comes down.

In Advaita we have no problem with this thinking for we admit several
entities to be anAdi, having not been created. For example, the jIva.
Excepting Brahman that is absolutely anAdi and absolutely ananta, all
others are admitted only as long as one is in the throes of avidyA.  In
other words, all other entities enjoy only a vyAvahArika reality.
