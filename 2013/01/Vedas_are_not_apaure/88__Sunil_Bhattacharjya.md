I think you have finally understood what is Apaurusheya. Looking from the phenomenal angle it is a hypothesis that works and is incontrovertible.

RV: I agree that atma can be intuited through manas but for that to happen
there has to be a negation of anatma through upadesa. The historical rishis
who first discovered the mantras that give atmajnana could not have been
atma jnanis because they did not have the upadesa in the first place. Or we
should say that they were atma jnanis in the previous cycle and re-appeared
in this cycle to teach. And as to how they became atma jnanis in the
previous cycle, we have to say it was in a previous cycle and so on. We
will have the contingency of vedic rishis never attaining videha mukti and
hence not being able to ever teach about that. On the other hand, if we
admit that the vedic rishis were only mediums that transmit the shruti
mantras, as per your example of newspaper reporter below, then we dont have
this contingency. Therefore, the rishi pratyaksha of the mantra "aham
brahmasmi" is very different from the laukika pratyaksha of pot and the
statement, "This is a pot". The former is a flow of knowledge that repeats
cycle after cycle whereas the latter is an articulation using the organ
speech what is seen using the organ eye. For another reason also, the rishi
pratyaksha of the mantra must be a flow of knowledge and not an
articulation of what they saw. There is talk about results of yajnas
attained after death. The rishi who discovered the mantra cannot be
reporting what he / she saw in this case because he does not have a
personal experience of death. And he cannot have a second-hand experience
either because before he discovered the mantra / yajna, no one else could
have performed the yajna or used the mantra.

There cannot be any advaita advaita (or for that matter purva mimamsa)
without apaureshyetva for another reason also. I can through logic infer
that I am not the body or mind but I cannot logically infer that I am
eternal. For that I need a pramana. The pramana cannot be pauresheya
because the question then comes how does that purusha know? We have to
argue that the purusha is trikalajna and / or sarvajna. Then the question
remains how does he know he is trikalajna and / or sarvajna. He may be
under delusion like a frog in a well thinking he knows all the waters that
there are in the world. So, we need an apauresheya pramana to state that.
Then the objection is that the apauresheya statement could be false and the
answer is that such a doubt is a case of presumption without a basis. Until
it is proven to be false, the apauresheya mantra is an incontrovertible
fact and as there is no means to falsify it (eternal existence of atma), it
is ever true.
