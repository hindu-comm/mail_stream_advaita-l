//anAdi mAyayA supto yadA jIvaH prabuddhyate
ajam anidram asvapnam advaitam budhyate tadA // [This is a kArikA (1.16) 
as
per Advaitins and a shruti passage for Dvaitins]

praNAms
Hare Krishna

If you could, kindly provide the detailed analysis of both views.  On what 
basis dvaitins say it is shruti and NOT a paurusheya grantha and OTOH how 
advaitins arguing that it is only paurusheya work written by parama guru 
of bhagavatpAda and NOT a shurti.  Are we (advaitins) saying this based on 
shankara's bhAshya vAkya on mAdUkya or something other valid pramANa is 
there to prove that it is ONLY paurusheya grantha!!?? 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
