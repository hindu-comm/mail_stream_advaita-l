Are the media reports true that the debate will take place?  Has this
been confirmed?

Why? The media has done their duty of publishing. That's it. 

It is the cheap publicity stunt of narendrananda saraswati for
attracting the public attention which is for cheap popularity. He
himself asked the media to publish the news.

So, nothing to worry about and beware of such *nishiddha gurus* in
kali yuga.

sriram
