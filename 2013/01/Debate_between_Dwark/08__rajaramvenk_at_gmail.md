Don't even worry. They have done enough damage to the tradition already through such disputes. There won't be any suicide as it is against the law. They will get arrested if they go that far.

I think people close to the other Sankaracharyas should meet the respective Sankaracharyas to find a way out to prevent this murder / suicide.

Its true that Mahaswami Chandrashekara Bharati played a crucial role
in the appointment of Bharati Krshna Tirtha Maharaj. Likewise, it
should also be noted that Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswami did try to
end the succession dispute of the Jyotir peetham. However, the
situation just wouldn't change! Nobody wished to compromise. Until
this issue is solved, these type of disputes will keep on arising.
Amidst all this, its only saddening to note that two Shankaracharyas
are fighting in such a fashion & the media is watching like a bunch of
hawks. Just look @ the caption given in the start of the article!
