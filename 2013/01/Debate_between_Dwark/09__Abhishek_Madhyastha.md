Sringeri Jagadguru by no means has the absolute authority over all
 Shankaracharyas. The Shankaracharyas of the 4 peethams function
 independently. Unless asked for, it would be inappropriate for the
 Sringeri Jagadguru to intervene in this matter. Moreover, the Sringeri
 acharyas have been known to be unparallel & sages par excellence. Each
 & every acharya in the parampara has truly lived up to the title of
 "Jagadguru". The present acharya wouldn't compromise on such a great
 parampara by indulging in such fights.
