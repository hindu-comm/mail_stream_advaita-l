Are the media reports true that the debate will take place?

//

Dwaraka Sankaracharya would be visiting the Allahabad in last week of Jan. So, there is no point of debate there. 

Moreover, the information has been passed to Dwaraka for clarification on this controversial news item. His Holiness clarified that Amanaya Pitha established by Adi Sankara has neither time nor energy to participate indebates with fake sanyasis and would never stoop to such levels being one among chaturAmnAya pithAs. 

BTW, Sringeri Acharya is doing His vijaya yatra in Andhra Pradesh and the information 
has been passed to His Holiness through proper channel. 

regs,
sriram
