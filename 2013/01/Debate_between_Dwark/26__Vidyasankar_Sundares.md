There are multiple versions of texts called maThAmnAya, so one cannot be sure which text this is
and where it came from. One also needs to be very careful not to conflate the historically established
and geographically located advaita maTha-s with the terms found in tAntrika texts and traditions. For
example, on the same web page cited below, we see AtmAmnAya, anuttarAmnAya, nishkalAmnAya
etc., which correspond to no earthly maTha-s in the advaita tradition. 

Anyway, the sumeru maTha in Kashi has a known history of a few centuries. Unfortunately, the person
currently heading that maTha has a penchant for going out his way and picking quarrels with the Puri
and Dwaraka Sankaracharyas. This has been happening for a few decades now, which is one of the
things that Sri Venkat Sriram alluded to in a guarded manner. The less said about it the better.

Those who are following the news on this "debate" at the Kumbha Mela may have noticed a recent 
news item on IBN Live, which cites a Kumbha Mela official as saying "Shringeri Peeth is controversial".
http://ibnlive.in.com/news/allahabad-4-shankaracharyas-boycott-maha-kumbh-mela/315651-3-242.html

Really? The irony is that the Sringeri Sankaracharya never had any plans to attend the ongoing Kumbha
Mela at all, as he has been traveling in south India for a year now. So the question of his supposedly
"boycotting" the event does not even arise. The abysmal level of knowledge on the part of the powers
that be in India and the shoddy fact-checking by the media means we should always make massive
allowances for misinformation and calculated propaganda from numerous angles.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
