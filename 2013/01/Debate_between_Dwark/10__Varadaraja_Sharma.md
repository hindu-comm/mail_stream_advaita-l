Radhe Krishna

What is irking much is surrender of wealth.  

na karmaNa na prajayA dhanEna thyAgEnaikE amrutatvamAsasu:

Sanyasa is taken after sacrificing karma, family and wealth.

To demand a sanyasi to surrender wealth ( something which he is not supposed to 
own)is sort of unimaginable flaw from those who are supposed to uphold tradition.
