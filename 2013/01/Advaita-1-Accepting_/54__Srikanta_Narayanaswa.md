Infact all knowledge comes from"Shabdha pramanam".A thing when it is said what it is comes from "Shabdha Pramanam".It is verbal testimony.A thing which is unknown is said by another by word.For instance,a cow if it is not known is said by word.Infact all things in the world is said by word.But, "Atma"which is not under the purview of 5 means of knowledge like pratyaksham etc.cannot be knowneven by shabdha pramanam"which comes under the 5 categories.
