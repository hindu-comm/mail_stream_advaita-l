Scientist discovering the helplessness in the process of research has the
right attitude and the MIND to appreciate and understand VEDANTA!

There is vast difference between Science and Vedanta.Science is based on repeated trials.If one result experimentally fails then another experiment has to be tried till one gets the result.Vedanta is not like that.It is based on sruthi adharita tarka.Only the sruthi is self evidence-Svatah pramana.In order to verify this we have,the limbs of tarka or logic;Pratyaksha,anumana,drstanta,upamana,arthapatti,nigamana.The mimamsakas also use-Anupalabdhi pramana.
Science is based on Vyavaharika satya.Vedanta is based on Paramarthika satya.There is fallibility in science.It should be repeatedly verified and updated.
Rutherford's atomic model was improved by Bohr's postulates.Particle physics was replaced by Wave mechanics.Light is considered both as a particle and also as a wave.
A scientist can fail in his experiment.It can be improved by another experiment.Just as Thomas Alva Edison said:Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.Science and Vedanta are two poles apart.
N.Srikanta.
