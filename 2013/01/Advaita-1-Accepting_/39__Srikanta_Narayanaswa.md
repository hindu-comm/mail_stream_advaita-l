If Atma Jnana doesnot come under the purview of 5 means of knowledge-pratyaksham etc.and if it is "Shabdha Pramanam,what is the method by which Atma Jnanam can be known by "Shabdha Pramanam"?Can Atma which is Nirguna,attributeless can be known by shabdha pramanam which has attributes?

Could you please explain what is "Adhikaritvam"?Further,hearing with respect to what in the "Bhashya"Bhashya is a vast ocean of knowledge.The GURU may be knowing or may think that he knows,but the disciple may not know.Understanding the "Bhashya"may be a easy as it involves verbal undestanding of sytax and semantics,but what it conveys involves a different process.Roughly putting in scientic jargan,it involves the Guru and the disciple on the same wavelength!Hence,understanding or dawn of knowledge is an intrinsic process.
