Consciousness
is not an object or an objectifiable entity - and science has no valid means to
inquire into it. naishaatarkena matiraapaneya – involves the logically one
cannot establish the absolute truth – also the statement implies that logically
one cannot negate the absolute truth- Hence objective scientific tools are
invalid in the pursuit of the absolute truth that pervades both the observer
and the observed.

The
famous Schrodinger’s cat problem is an example in point. 
Hence
Vedanta becomes a pramaana and apurusheyatva aspect provides a basis for the
faith in the statements of the Vedanta to proceed for valid inquiry of the
nature of Brahman or self that I am. The truth being aprameyam or not being an
object of knowledge, Vedanta acts as a pramaana only removes the ignorance that
is blocking my vision of the truth– it does not reveal Brahman as Brahman as
conscious entity is self-revealing.

The
confusion comes only if one applies objective tools to understand the subject. Science
is valid in its sphere of reference, that is, within vyavahaara for
understanding objectifiable entities – which are products of Iswara sRishTi. Mixing
the references states becomes a fundamental problem as is evident in many of these
posts. 
Incidentally
the same problem persists in the self-realization as one tries to objectify the
subject or Brahman – This forms the basic difference in paroxa jnaanam vs
aparoxa jnaanam. Gradations in the jnaani is only due to gradations in moving
from the former to the later as it is not discrete process. The so-called
stages of jnaani is only a digitization of
analog problem!

Both science as well Vedanta needs consciousness.One cannot enquire into consciousness.Science has certain proved experimental results which cannot be questioned till it is experimentally proved false.Einstein's theory of Relativity is still being validated with each experimental results.But,Vedanta cannot be verified like scientic results.What is true for Ramana Maharshi is true for himself.It cannot be verified,by another.This way science and Vedanta belongs to different speheres and dimensions.Science has practical utility.But,Vedanta cannot be applied to practical utility.What is Self-realization cannot be defined.One cannot apply the scientific postulates to Vedanta.There is no way of verifying what is Brahman!One has to go only to the sruthi texts and read what is said there.It is said there are no gradations in Jnana.
