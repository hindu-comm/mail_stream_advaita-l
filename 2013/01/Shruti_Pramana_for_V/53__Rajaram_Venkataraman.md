Dear Friends,

I am consolidating the list of available shruti pramana for veda
apauresheyam. If there are statements that directly talk about them being
apauresheyam, great. Equally useful will be statements that talk about
vedas as eternal, without origin and infinite. Please let me know if you
know.

There are some listed in the blog http://apaureshyatva.blogspot.co.uk/  I
could not find exact reference for ananta vai veda and the kataka portion
of yajur veda. If you have that please share.

Thanks in advance.

Best Regards
Rajaram Venkataramani
