I wish to know and collect all known vRitti-s of brahmasUtra according to
advaita-matam. As my knowledge is limited, I ask members to suggest names.
If possible, add name of author, status of publication, online and/or
offline availability, etc.
We are planning to collect, edit and publish useful and effective ones.
