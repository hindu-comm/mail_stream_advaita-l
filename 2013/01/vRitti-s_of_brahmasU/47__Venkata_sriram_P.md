Namaste,

/////

I wish to know and collect all known vRitti-s of brahmasUtra according to
advaita-matam. As my knowledge is limited, I ask members to suggest names.
If possible, add name of author, status of publication, online and/or
offline availability, etc.

Just see here if it is useful for you or not

It is the Anandashrama Mudralaya. The vritti was written by Shri Hari Dikshit and
compiled by Ranganatha Sastry and republished by Hari Narayan Apte.

regs,
sriram
