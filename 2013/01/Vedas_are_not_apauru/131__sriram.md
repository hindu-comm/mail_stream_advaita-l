Dear Sri Vidyasankar Sundaresan
You had stated that  knowledge is vastu tantra and not purushatantra.I think knowledge results only when both interact in right measures.Vasthu being inert purusha the sentient being grasps the presence of the vasthu and by experimentation and toying with the vasthu gathers the nature of the vasthu and retains the resultant impressions and passes it on to the others and builds up.In that respect only apaurusheyathvam of Vedas is under scrutiny.
It is another matter whether apaurusheyathvam is necessary for the Vedas to be accepted as pramana.It is all a matter of faith.Knowledge has to be paurusheya only as intelligence is required to grasp the environment and memory sure aids its retention.It applies to all jungamas and sthavaras to some extent.R.Krishnamoorthy.
