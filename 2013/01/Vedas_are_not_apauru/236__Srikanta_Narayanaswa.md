RV: Then you have to perform a yajna, without sraddha until the success
proves it. And it will never succeed because you did not have sraddha, a
pre-requisite for success. There is a way out of this.

"A statement, is true until it is refuted."

This leads to sraddha as the starting position and not doubt. It also gives
room for correction and pogression of knowledge.On the face of it, it is
simplistic but is on a strong foundation superior to philosophy of
science. Karl Popper's falsifiability criterion is like an incubator of
doubt and inhibitor of subjective truth.

"A statement is true until it is refuted".A statement in science or Mathematics is true until it is refuted.But,in Vedanta,in Atma Jnana,this is not valid.first of all,a statement like "Aham Brahmasmi'or "Tatva masi"cannot be refuted.Because,there is no way of verifying it or refuting it.In order to verify it one has to go to the relevant text and study it,how the proponent of the Mahavakya(for instance in Chandogya Upanishad)goes about explaining it.Or,in order to disprove it,one has to go about a counter thesis.Either he has to accept it,or reject it.
