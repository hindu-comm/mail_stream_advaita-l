> The inebriating Divine Smile that stills the mind of the saintly fortunate
> The smile that grants beatitude even while living in mundane world
> That inundates the heart with unalloyed bliss
>
> That bestows bounty and saintliness on its votaries
> That which accomplishes the purpose of life and grants supreme divine
> fulfillment
> That which invigorates life with energy divine
> That which attracts and intoxicates the eyes of Shiva, who burnt lust to
> ashes
> That which assures protection to the gods and the virtuous
> That which grants succour to devotees from the vortex of desires
> That which pours out parental affection to Guha, Ganesha and all beings of
> the three worlds
> That for which the saintly are thirsty
> That divine rapturous smile of Tripurasundari, Lalita
> I adore constantly, for it intoxicates me with Her supreme
> LOVE.
