Namaste,

Quite a number of years ago I read an article in the Readers Digest, where it told a real case study. In a school it so happened that the new school session started but the french teacher could not join the school at that time and she would join only after a month. The head of the school requested a French-knowing person to keep the students busy during the French-class period for one month. After one month the regular teacher arrived and she was shocked to find that each and every student could speak French fluently, whereas her past students even after one year of training were no match for these students who had the temporary substitute teacher for just one month.

The message : It mostly depends on the teacher.

Regards,
Sunil KB

I do not know which year students you tested. I have observed students of
senior classes conversing quite freely in Sanskrit. They, even while in
the graduation classes, participate in oral exams conducted by various
institutions in different places and win prizes too. About two years ago I
was witness to a shalAkA parIkShA in nyAya, vyAkaraNa and raghuvamsha
conducted by the Aksharam people in Girinagar, Bangalore. I sat in two or
three examination halls as an observer (uninvited) where the entire
shalAkA parIkShA was in Sanskrit alone and each examinee tested in some
nine rounds involving various degrees of complexities of the subject.
Students from all over India had come. I noticed students of the
Purnaprajna VidyapeeTha, Bangalore and Sringeri pAThashAla from Sringeri
winning prizes.

The sambhAShana shibira-s are no doubt a fine catalyst for Sanskrit
awareness and interest-creation. As in any course, much depends on the
participating students too. Not everyone who attends the ten-day course
take the learning further. It is only a small percentage who take up the
follow-up studies seriously. In the course I attended, I appreciated the
interest of a young householder Madhva working in a senior position in the
IT sector, side by side taking up Dvaita Vedanta exams conducted by the
Govt.Sanskrit College here. He manages to attend the classes also there
sometimes. He attended the conversation course only for some four days out
of ten, owing to work pressure. On days of inability to attend the
classes, he would give me a call on my cell phone and listen to the class
at his office, amidst work. Every night he would call me and get an update
of the proceedings. He saw to it that we converse in Sanskrit alone, right
or wrong. His love for his shAstra and samskrita is an ideal for everyone
to emulate. We became friends since the shibira and he invited me to his
gruhapravesham. At the function I could see so many scholars of Dvaita
vedanta. He built his house as a twin to his brother's house (also new)
and the two houses are named 'sarvamUla' and 'anantAsana', terms very
important for their siddhAnta.

I think for everything there has to be an apt adhikAri. What is taken up
for vAkyArtha in the annual sadas is not an every-day topic of Swami
Dayananda Saraswati or Swami Paramarthananda. The topics are from the
Brahmasutras, an adhikaraNa where there is the method of viShayavAkya,
samshaya, pUrvapaksha, siddhAnta. Sometimes the topics are from the
Upanishad bhashyam. Those are topics where apparent contradictions across
upanishadic sentences are settled after due deliberation. Such are not the
topics that the Swamis take in a class. Even if they teach Brahmasutra
bhashyam in English, they do not get into the detail that happens in the
sadas. Also, the sadas is not meant for ordinary, non-sanskrit people.
The audience is another group of vidwans. Only they can appreciate the
presentations.

The Advaita scholars in Chennai too take classes aimed at non-sanskrit
people. They take even Advaita siddhi classes in Tamil. Many people
attend them. For example, one can see how nicely Dr. Mani Dravid Sastrigal
teaches the Vedanta paribhAShA in Hindi which is being uploaded now
periodically. His commitment to make tough concepts understandable by
using apt examples can be appreciated.

आचार्यात् पादमादत्ते पादं शिष्यः स्वमेधया ।
पादं सब्रह्मचारिभ्यः पादं कालक्रमेण च ॥

This verse implies that a quarter of a student's knowledge comes from the
teacher; a quarter through one's own intelligence; a quarter from peers and
a quarter in due course (through experiences in life).
