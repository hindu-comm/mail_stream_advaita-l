If we are physically and mentally unfit, don't desire to make ourselves fit or unable to, we can't get all the benefits of vaidhika karma and should leave it at that. We can't blame the traditional system or ask for it to be made easy for dummies. It is like saying I can't do well in studies and therefore give me reservation in colleges so that I can also become a doctor.

Namaste

In olden days people were walking to Kashi and do Kashi Yatra. Today they
travel in trains and planes to Kashi and have Darshan of Kashi Vishwanath.
We cannot say even today also we have to walk to Kashi like the traditional
method. It is not practical because people have become physically and
mentally weak. We have to adjust to the modern developments.

In olden times all Brahmins were memorizing whole Veda and say mantras not
looking at books. Today only one or few people in hundred know only some
portions of the Veda by heart. All others say mantras looking at books. We
are mentally weak now than people in olden times. We have to accept that.
We cannot memorize that much.
