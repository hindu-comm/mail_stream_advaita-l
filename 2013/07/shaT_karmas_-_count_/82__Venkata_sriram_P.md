Namaste,

Need some clarification on the count of shaT karmAs. The following sloka
details out the karmas to be done by brahmins and the number is 6 (shaTkarmANi
dinE dinE) (vide 36th sloka from parashara smriti).

sandhyA snAnaM japO hOmO dEvatAtithipUjanaM
AtithyaM vaishwadEvaM cha shaTkarmANi dinE dinE .....36

The no. of karma prescribed in the sloka is 7 whereas it is said as
"shaT karmANi" (6). 

1. sandhya
2. snAnaM
3. japa
4. hOma
5. dEvata pUjana
6. atithi pUjana
7. vaishwadEva

The above comes to 7 but how come it is said "shaTkarmANi dinE dinE" ?

Any thoughts ?

regs,
sriram
