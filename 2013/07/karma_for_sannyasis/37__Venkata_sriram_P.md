Namaste,

///

My question is why is a sanyasi allowed to worship Ishwara if bhakti is ajnana? 
Is he expected to worship Ishwara as that would be like forcing him in to ajnana? 
If it is to set an example for others, then why not he set an example by running goshala, a good karma or performing fire sacrifices? These are also purifying acts like upasana. 

//

yati dharma says "na bAhya dEvArchanaM kuryAt" ie., they should not worship
the devata externally. There are various forms of upAsana like ahaMgrahOpAsana,
nirguNa mAnasa pUja, parA pUja etc. which is the only vidhi for sanyasis. 

There are different stages for yatis like kutichaka, bahudaka etc.and one just can't become jivanmuktas in a jiffy by donning ocre robes.

Good karmas for sanyasis too are like golden chains which bind them. Which is why atma dhyAna coupled with vedanta shravana, manana. 

Only jivanmuktas can do such type of good activities perfectly as in them there is no kartrutva bhAvana. 

These answers were well given by Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati Swamigal when a certain devotee asked Him why He is doing chandramoulishwara puja even though He is a jnani.

regs,
sriram
