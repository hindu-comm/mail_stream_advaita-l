The former type of ajnAna is liberating in nature and the latter is
binding.  The logic is well laid out in the Bh.Gita karma yoga.  karma, by
nature, being avidyA-born (Br.up. teaches the sequence: avidyA, kAma and
karma (and bandha) ) is binding in nature.  Yet when done as karma-yoga is
not only non-binding, but liberating, that is, it facilitates liberation by
taking the aspirant to jnAna yoga.  But the other type of ajnAna, cattle,
etc. will be binding and not liberating; they tighten one's bonds.
