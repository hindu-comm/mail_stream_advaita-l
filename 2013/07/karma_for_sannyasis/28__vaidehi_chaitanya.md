by sanyas it means renounciation including any type of karma. karma is not
ordained for sanyasins rather giving up karma is
hailed/prescribed/suggested. pl do not compare this sruti statement said in
upanishads with that of today's institution bound sanyasis. they are more
bound than ordinary people.

for a true sanyasi, karmas do not matter at all. they may or may  not do
any karma. neither affects the sanyasi.
