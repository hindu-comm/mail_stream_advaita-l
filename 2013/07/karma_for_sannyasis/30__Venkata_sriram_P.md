Namaste,
sanyAsa is sAdhana and jivanmukti is sAdhya. 
A jivanmukta is not bound by any karmas norkarmas bind him.
This is the only difference.
yati dharma has 'n' no. of karmas for sanyasisbut ultimately as one ascends step by step injnAna bhumikAs, slowly, these drop off. Thehighest being the "paramahamsa", thereis no vidhi & nishedha. 
Sadasivabrahmendra Saraswati used to roamlike a mad man on the streets of kaveri.He was a true paramahamsa.
