namaste,

A non-jivanmukta, by definition, has kartRtva-bhAva and engages in karma
while 'working towards' jivanmuktatva, be it through vaidika karma,
upasana, or something else.

Presumably, the sannyasi is further along the path towards loosening the
ashta pashas -- ghRNaa, lajjaa, bhaya, shankaa, jugupsaa, kula, jaati and
shiila. It would be quite difficult to overcome some of these pashas while
remaining within the confines of the vaidika karma marga.

Sannyasis have the freedom to attack these pashas directly, without
worrying about anything else.

Ultimately, there is a continuum between an agyani and jivanmuktatva.

sasneham,

    ajit
