I am not sure   whether I am directly answering your question?

but just reflect on what if a sanyasi/jivanmukta/ sadhaka tills the land
and engages in agriculture? Is it not a "good" karma?  In karma there is no
good and bad, rather the intent with which karma is performed makes a karma
good or bad.

Our office going, working in the office are all karma. can we say these or
good or bad karmas? can we say earning money, wealth is good or bad? rather
can we say, intent with which money is earned, work is carried out in the
office, acquiring the wealth is important. All these have their own
importance in the relative plane which cannot be ruled out. Ant Karma is a
reality in the relative plane of truth.

study of sastra  is the first step. seeing it in today's context especially
when it comes to relative truths is equally important.
