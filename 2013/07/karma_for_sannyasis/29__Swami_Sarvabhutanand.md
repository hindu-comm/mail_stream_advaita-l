A sannyAsi renouncing KARMA frees himself/herself to pursue BRAHMAjnAnam
without any vyvahAric commitment.
Karma sannyAsA is having the knowledge of the fact-I am akartA akartA
vashAt abhoktA!
This knowledge properly sunk and living in this body mind one can be called
a JIVAN MUKTA to spend the balance prArabdA till the body drops.
Swami Sarvabhutananda
