In the Prashnopanishad 5.2 there occurs a mantra:

तस्मै स होवाच  एतद्वै सत्यकाम *परं चापरं च ब्रह्म* यदोंकारः।
तस्माद्विद्वानेतेनैवायतनेनैकतरमन्वेति

Here the commentary of Shankaracharya is: परं सत्यमक्षरं पुरुषाख्यम्  अपरं
च प्राणाख्यं प्रथमजं ....[Para brahman is the Ultimate PuruSha, the Supreme
Being.  apara brahman is the First-born, known as prANa]  It is this latter
that is meant by the word 'ब्रह्म’ in 'स ब्रह्म...’ in the nArAyaNa sUkta
other reading.

In the Brahmasutra 4.3.7 कार्यं बादरिरस्य गत्युपपत्तेः the
Chandogyopanishad mantra 4.15.5 स एनान्ब्रह्म गमयति  is taken for
discussion and concluded that the 'brahma' here is the apara/kArya
brahman(and not the Parabrahman).  In that Upanishad bhAShyam too it
is clarified
that this 'brahma' is the one that resides in satyaloka.
