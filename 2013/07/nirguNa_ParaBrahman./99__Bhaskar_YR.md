Have you got the term 'parabrahman' used, and, what is meant by vedas OR 
upaniShads.

praNAms Sri praNipata prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I think Sri Subbu prabhuji is the best on line source for these issues 
:-))  I think in prashna shruti there is a mention of both para & apara 
brahman..Here 'praNava' (OmkAra) is said to be both para & apara...And as 
you know the famous mantra from mundaka : sa yO ya vai tatparamaM brahma 
veda brahmaiva bhavati..For more references there is an exclusive 
commentary by shankara where he clearly says what is para brahma i.e. 
jneya brahma. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
