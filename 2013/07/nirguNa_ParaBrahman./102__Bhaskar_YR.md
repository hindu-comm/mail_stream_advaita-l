If the world is known to be real, then nirguna, nirAkari, nirvisesha etc. 
can be interpreted to negate material binding, material form, material 
attributes etc. Is it not?

praNAms
Hare Krisha

shruti also says brahman is 'avraNaM' (wound less), if we go by above 
interpretation for nivikAra etc. then we will have to conclude that 
brahman must be having 'aprAkrutika' vraNa if not prAkrutika 'vraNaM' :-)) 


Hari Hari Hari bol!!!
bhaskar
