Hare Krishna. Can some one point me to a copy of the critical edition of
Bhakti Rasayana by Madhusudana Saraswati? I have a version but wanted to
ensure that I am looking at the right one.

Madhusudana wrote the commentary on the first ullasa. I would like to have
that also. Please also let me know later day advaitins who quote Bhakti
Rasayana.
