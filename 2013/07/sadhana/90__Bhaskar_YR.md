I would like to know what is the
standard advaita process for citta suddhi as per Sankara and other early
advaitins. Does it have defined stages?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

As far as my knowledge goes shankara recommends 'svadharmAnushtAna' for 
the chitta shuddhi.  Chitta vrutti nirOdha is not the mOksha 
sAdhana..shAstrAchAryOpadesha shama damAdi saMskrutaM manaH Atma darshane 
karaNAm clarifies shankara in geeta bhAshya...If we see geeta itself we 
have the verses like tadviddhi praNipAtena, pariprashnena sevaya etc. and 
shrui : tadvijnAnArthaM sa gurumevAbhigaccheth, samitpANiH shrOtreeyaM 
brahma nishTaM...And as you know, nityAnityavastu vivekAdi sAdhana 
chatushtaya and shravaNAdi pratyaksha sAdhana for the Atma jnAna.  bhakti 
is closely knitted in all these vaidika sAdhana since saguNOpAsaNa in 
vaidika mArga sAdhana will play a vital role.

And with regard to Sri madhusUdhana saraswati's observation with regard to 
jeevan mukti as presented by you :

// quote //

According to him tattva jnana or even jivan mukti does not
guarantee freedom of the mind from anarthas. One has to go through
vasanakshaya and manonasa through yogic processes of total control
(samyama). 

// unquote//

>  I donot want to comment anything on above as it plainly goes against 
the shankara siddhAnta of jeevan mukti or tattva jnAna or paramArtha 
jnAna.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
