Namaste,

This is explained in the post whose link is copied below:
http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2013-July/035039.html

Vaikuntha, Kailas are closer to the asymptotic perfection in
the State-2 of shuddha-ashuddha tattvas. Reaching these or
more correctly finding a lasting place in these is 
possible with asymptotic perfection of understanding
shuddha tattav-s - nirguNa brahma - State-1. And this
asymptotic perfection of understanding nirguNa brahma
is just another way of referring to advaita siddhi.

hari om.

Regards,
Shrini
