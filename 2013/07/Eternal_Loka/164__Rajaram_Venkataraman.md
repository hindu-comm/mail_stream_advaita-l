There is a contradiction in the following two statements about what happens
on mahapralaya. Do Ishwara and Vedas become one Parabrahman or Ishwara
(Avyakta)? The key question for the topic of our discussion is what happens
to the infinite knowledge of Ishwara. It has to exist in some state or else
it will be impossible to resume the universe.

Ishwar neither "dies" nor does shruti become "non-existent". They merge
(i.e. lose separate identity) in the *parabrahman*. They are then
regenerated in a new cycle of creation. Seems pretty obvious to me from a
reading of Advaita Vedanta.

The *Ishwara* tattvam in Advaita is none other than the *avyaktam* with
chaitanyam of the Mandukya upanishad sixth mantra. All the earlier manifest
prapancha is now in the unmanifest, avyakta, state. The Vedas too remain in
*avyakta *form, only for being 'brought out' in the next creation in vyakta
form.
