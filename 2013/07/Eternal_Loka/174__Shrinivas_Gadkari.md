Namaste Shri Subrahmanian,

I VERY STONGLY disagree with your statement below. On the 
contrary, nirguNa brahma has EVERYTHING to do with EVERY
single aspect of creation. 

I do not know when this devastating paradigm entered into 
the Indian spiritual thinking? At least I do not sense this
being around from the overall outlook of main characters
in mahabhArat and ramayana.

It is however true that in last 1000-1200 years this thought
seems to be around. I would give this paradigm (and its
devastating implications) almost all the"credit" of
briging Hinduism/ Vedic religionfrom "the glory that
it was", to "the glory that it is".

I would request anyone who is interested in restoring glory
of the Vedic religion, to carefully note this.

One can subscribe to a-dvaita flavour of Vedanta wherein
nirguNa brahma is interested in creation. I do.


Hari om,

Regards,
Shrinivas


almost desand is the single most reason

We have to know that the Nirguna brahman has nothing to do with any aspect
of creation. It is only the Brahman with mAyopAdhi that is called
sometimes Parabrahman to differentiate it from apara brahman that are
Hiranyagarbha, virAT and the like. In the Taittiriya shruti 'yato vA imAni
bhUtAni jAyantE....yat prayantyabhisamvishanti' it is the mAyopAdhika
brahman that is the source, support and resolution abode of creation.
