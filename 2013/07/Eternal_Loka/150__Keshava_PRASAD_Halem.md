Dear Sadananda-ji and Friends:

This may seem to be dragging the discussion sideways. However, when i read about vaikunTha and kailaasa from your post some thing occurred to my mind and i thought that i may as well share it with the group. Before i do that, here is a warning signal - my intention is not to drag the discussion sideways, but a sincere attempt to touch upon all aspects of whatever one is talking about.

Now let me pose my question -
If in fact vaikunTha and kailaasa are where mukta jIvas are posited, then is it not also true that they being there can not be subjected to any bindings from kaarmic cause-effect relationships? Now then, how do we explain the story/episode of jaya-vijaya dealing with sanaka+sananda etc?


Sorry if it is a distraction to deal with such questions.
I thought that it is a good food for thought any way.

Regards,
Keshava Prasad Halemane
=======================


Vaikunta and Kailaasa aresupposed to be where mukta jiivas go, and therefore do not come under vyaavahaarika lokas as per Advaita. As pervishishTaadvaita, for example - they are lokas where there is no return backsince they are liberated even thoughthey will be transacting with each other and alsoserving the Lord, while enjoying infinite happiness.
