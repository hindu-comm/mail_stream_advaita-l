How obvious is that? We don't know rishis through pratyaksha or anumana but only through sabda. Unless we have pramana to say that sarvajna Ishwara dies during mahapralaya, we can't say His very breadth sabda becomes non-existent. If sabda exists, then all entities describes  there exist as sabda, which includes the rishis.
