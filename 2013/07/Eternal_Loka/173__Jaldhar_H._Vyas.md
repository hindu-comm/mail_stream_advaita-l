Ishwar neither "dies" nor does shruti become "non-existent".  They merge 
(i.e. lose separate identity) in the parabrahman.  They are then 
regenerated in a new cycle of creation.  Seems pretty obvious to me from a 
reading of Advaita Vedanta.  Whereas you are are having dffculties because 
you are trying to shoehorn a completely different outlook into it.
