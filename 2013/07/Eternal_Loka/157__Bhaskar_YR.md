Hare Krishna

Hare Krishna. We will come to significance of this later. First, do you 
agree that there are eternal names and forms as per advaita? I've quoted 
the smrti and sridhara. If you disagree, then you should quote an earlier 
advaita acharya. 

>  Why only vaikunta or kailAsa eternal for the paramArtha jnAni or as per 
advaita ??  As sri vidyA prabhuji said for the jnAni wherever he is for 
him it is  vaikunTa/kailAsa only and whatever he sees (nAma rUpa)  is in 
its 'sadrUpa' vishNu/nArAyaNa only.   yasmin brahmaNi pancha pancha janAH, 
OtaM cha prOtaMcha ...amrutaM brahma manye ahaM, na cha ahaM AtmAnaM 
tatOnyatvena jAne...sa cha bAhyalOkO nAsti asmAkaM Atma 
vyatiriktaH.....sarvaM hi asmAkaM AtmabhutaM eva sarvasya cha vayaM 
AtmabhUtaH clarifies shruti / shankara...So, socalled vaikunata / kailAsa 
lOka-s, permanent residents of these lOka-s, deva-s, pitru-s, gandharva-s 
etc. and their nAma,  rUpa-s etc. are not anyway Atma vyatiriktaH for the 
paramArtha jnAni. 

I've quoted the smrti and sridhara. If you disagree, then you should quote 
an earlier advaita acharya. 

>  I think sri sridhara's commentary should be understood as per the 
samyak or samAna drushti of the paramArtha jnAni.  samaM pashyanhi 
sarvatra, samavasthitamIshvaraM says geeta...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
