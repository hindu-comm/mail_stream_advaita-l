Your question doesn't make any sense.  Any vyavaharic thing is by 
definition limited by time i.e. non-eternal.  The last adhikarana of the 
brahmasutras deals with krama mukti and based on that you could call the 
brahmaloka eternal in a relative way because those jivas who have attained 
it never return into samsara.  However, they along with the brahmaloka are 
merged into brahman at the mahapralaya.
