The Ishwara tattvam in Advaita is none other than the avyaktam with
chaitanyam  of the Mandukya upanishad sixth mantra.  In pralaya there is
not even time.  All the earlier manifest prapancha is now in the
unmanifest, avyakta, state.  We have heard of BrahmA's sleep.  Ishwara is
not a person with any fixed form.  All the forms that are talked of for
Ishwara are posited on that non-person for upAsana purposes.  The Vedas too
remain in avyakta form, only for being 'brought out' in the next creation
in vyakta form.  It is certainly not non-existence from which everything
emerges.  That is why these entities are accorded a pravAha nityatvam
distinct from the kUTastha nityatvam of the nirvikAri nirguNa brahman.
