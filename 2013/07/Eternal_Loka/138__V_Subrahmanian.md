It is only when the intellect is working there can be any thought or talk
of time.  The advaitic idea of time is: avidyA-chit samyogaH kAlaH.  'Time
is the conjunction/admixture of avidyA and Pure Consciousness.'  So, only
when this impossible conjunction 'happens' does the occasion for time
arises.  So, there is nothing wrong in having that time does not exist, in
a scenario where Consciousness alone exists.  This is the Advaita
pAramArthika tattvam.  A brahma loka or vaikunTha where duality exists is
not the Advaitic ultimate.
