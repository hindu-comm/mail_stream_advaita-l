Thank you Sri Subrahmanian-ji for the explanation about the case of jaya-vijaya.

From the purely advaitic view point, when saguNa-brahman 'itself' has only a relative-reality, meaning that it applies to vishNu whose abode is vaikunTha that we are talking about, naturally the question of the others in vaikunTha cannot be any better than just be of relative-reality.
So the explanation has to be to create more and more conceptual details in order to appease the ever-hungry intellect.

[sorry, i am reminded about Sri Madathil's point of not intending to get into a long discussion on this small point]!

Thanks again.
KpH

Pl. cite those shastras with accurate reference/text, etc. and we shall see
how they can be treated in advaita.

And with regard to Shri Keshava's question, the dvaitins hold that there
are two vaikunthas: one lower and the other higher: prAkRta and aprAkRta (I
think that is the distinction, though Vishishtadvaitins have kArana and
kArya vaikinthas) The vaikunta from where jaya vijaya returned is the
lower one. That is the explanation they give. But HH Sri Chandrashekhara
Bharati Swamiji of Sringeri, while referring to non-advaitic moksha has
cited the jaya-vijaya case as one where there is no abolute mukti but only
relative, if any loka-prApti is admitted as mukti by various schools.
