Respected Members,

"If there is no sarvajna Ishwara after pralaya, who will create as before
and award rewards of karma in previous kalpa?"

In a statement like the above, the key words look to me to be "(a world) as
BEFORE."

Because we recognized something to be in the likeness of what was earlier,
we assumed that it must have been the product resulting from the earlier
thing based on the operation of cause-effect relationships we are familiar
with. From then on, we are using impeccable logic, shastra-s, pramANa, the
words of authoritative commentators and so on to explain / understand the
various subsequent issues.

But have we subjected our INITIAL presumption, which seems to have slipped
from below our radar of hair-splitting analysis, to the same rigor of
unbiased, fair and open examination that we are insisting for later on
developments?

What incontestable evidence can one  ever have that a world is created in
the exact similitude or as an effect of whatever was there earlier? Is this
not a huge unverified (unverifiable) conclusion?

Brahman (the word does not stand for an entity but used only as a pointer
to some inexpressible 'no-thing thing' having certain "intrinsic qualities"
like Beingness-Knowingness-Infiniteness) is HISTORYLESS (no past - is ever
afresh and anew). Perhaps, creation is anew from moment to moment, with
each new thought coming and going!

regards,
