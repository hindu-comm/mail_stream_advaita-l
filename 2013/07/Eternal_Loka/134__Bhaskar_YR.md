"If there is no sarvajna Ishwara after pralaya, who will create as before
and award rewards of karma in previous kalpa?"

praNAms Sri Rajaram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Month end hectic at office anyway could not resist this rapid reply 
:-))...as per advaita, brahman is and always sarvajnA though there is no 
'sarva' as such after praLaya. So brahman remains as sarvajna even after 
mahApraLaya but there is no chance for him to exhibit this quality as 
there is no 'sarva'.  And further brahman has the capacity to illuminate 
everything (if at all it is there) and its self-luminosity does not go 
anyway even there is nothing after praLaya.  There is a discussion about 
this in sUtra 1.1.5  I think...Sri subbu prabhuji, kindly pick the 
relevant portion from this sUtra bhAshya and share with us.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
