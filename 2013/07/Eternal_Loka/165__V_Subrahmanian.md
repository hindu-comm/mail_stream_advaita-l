I do not see any contradiction. Ishwara's knowledge is only inferred by his
actions/products.  That is how the janmAdi sutra bhashyam describes.  And
since nothing can come out of non-existence, it is held that Ishwara is in
avyakta avasthA.  Ishwara is non-different from his vyakta form, that is
the world, and the avyakta state, that is the nascent state of the
to-be-manifest world.  I do not see any difficulty in this.
