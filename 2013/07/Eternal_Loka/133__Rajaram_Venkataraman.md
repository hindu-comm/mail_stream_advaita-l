Namaskaram.

We can rest assured that the modern meat eating globe trotting swamis know
little about Advaitam compared to Sridhara. Do you think he did not know
paramarthika or vyavaharika when he wrote so about Vaikuntha? I pointed out
the basic flaw in Shree Subrahmanian's analysis of the usage of Vaikuntha
by Sridhara, which you have not responded to.

I repeatedly asked a basic question that exposes a fundamental flaw in your
understanding of Advaitam, which has gone unanswered. Further discussion is
meaningful only if you can answer this.

 "If there is no sarvajna Ishwara after pralaya, who will create as before
and award rewards of karma in previous kalpa?"
