Shree Rajaram - There is fundamental problem in the whole analysis. All that you mentioned, Iswara with sarvajna, laya, pralaya, karma, jiiva, jnaanam, ajnanaam -lokas, even puurva miimamsa, utta miimaamsa that include Sreedhara swami bhaashya, Bhattas, praabhaakaras, miimaasa positions, and anything else you name it, all and any divisions and distinctions which differentiates in terms ofsajaati, vijaati swagata bhedas- allare only transactionally real. Noone disputes that. From paaramaarthika point - existence-consciousness alone was there which has no distinctions of any kind - ekam eva advitiiyam. Hence nirguna brahman we talk about refers to that prajnanam brahma - that which is one without a second. Ontologically paramaarthika satyam differs from vyaavahaarika satyam which again differs form praatibhaasika satyam. The adviata teachingis from paaramaarthika satyam. Confusion arises if try to mix these things - from what reference these
 distinctions you mentioned are valid. You may not agree with this, but advaita categorically dismisses any distinctions of any kind from the absolute point.
