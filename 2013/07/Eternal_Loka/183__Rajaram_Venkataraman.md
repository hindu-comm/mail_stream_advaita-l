Srauta Karma clearly restricts meat eating. If we dont stop putting on a
pedetal people who eat meat, flouting dharma, we will not have proper
knowledge because we partake of their sinful disposition. There are sri
vaishnava, gaudiya, madhwa, saiva and smarta bhaktas around the world who
are able to control their senses and live a selfless life of compassion.

BTW, in Dahara VidyAdhikaranam, Sankara clearly says that the way to
understand Brahman is to consider that all the worlds are present in it -
of course - as Brahman. This is how it should be taught, he asserts.


IMO, "It is not because it is devoid of all qualities, it is called nirguna
brahman. It is full of all qualities and hence it is called nirguna brahman
because when something has all qualities it is actually devoid of it also
because there is nothing to delimit it. We call white light colourlessbut
when put through a prism, it shows all colours. For this reason, it can
also be called full of colours by one jo sees colours. Nirguna Brahman is
like white light. Thorugh the prism of maya it is able to manifest all
attributes"
