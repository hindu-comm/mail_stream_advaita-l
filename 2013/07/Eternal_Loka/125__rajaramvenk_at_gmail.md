Here is the translation of Sridhara's commentary on SBh 2.5.39. 

Brahmaloka means Vaikunta. It is eternal. It is not grouped with the material world which has a creation.

Hare Krishna.

*1. smrti and bhashya evidence that vaikuntha is eternal:*
grīvāyāḿ janaloko 'sya tapolokaḥ stana-dvayāt mūrdhabhiḥ satyalokas tu
brahmalokaḥ *sanātanah* (SBh 2.5.39) Sridhara comments for this verse that
Vaikuntha is eternal. Kadalangudi Natesa Sastrigal, who belongs to advaita
sampradaya, also translates it into Tamil as nityamana vaikuntamum (eternal
vaikunta).

*2. smrti evidence that there is no fear in vaikuntha:*
ātapatraḿ tu vaikuṇṭhaḿ dvijā *dhāmākuto-bhayam *tri-vṛd vedaḥ
suparṇākhyo (SBh 12.11.19). In "mutthi neri", Sringeri Periyva talks about
fear due to duality in the world of gods. Such fear is denied in Vaikuntha,
the world of Vishnu.

There is definitely a difference between Indraloka (temporary) and
Vaikuntha (permanent).
