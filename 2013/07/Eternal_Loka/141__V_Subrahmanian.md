Who uses pratyakSha pramANa?  It is the pramAtA.  This entity is
fundamentally consciousness.  So, an eternal world which is proved/revealed
through pratyakSha is undeniably dependent on that pramANa and through
that, the pramAtA, and through him, Conscousness.  Anything that has to
depend for its very existence/revelation on something else is unreal, just
like the superimposed snake that has no existence of its own but has to
invariably exist on the existence borrowed from the rope.  It might give
one some solace to think 'the world is eternal.'  That is avichAita dRShTi
for Vedanta.  The vichArita dRShTi, the enquired-into view is different.
That is what a follower of Vedanta will accept.
