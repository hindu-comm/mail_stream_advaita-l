Shree Rajaram - PraNAms. You should know too, if I may say so. Vaikunta and kailasa do not come under the Bhoutika prapancha that consists of 14 lokas. In the krama mukti the highest is satya loka where jiiva either come back to the earth or gets Vedantic knowledge from Brahmaji and gets liberated at the end of that loka.

Vaikunta and Kailaasa aresupposed to be where mukta jiivas go, and therefore do not come under vyaavahaarika lokas as per Advaita. As pervishishTaadvaita, for example - they are lokas where there is no return backsince they are liberated even thoughthey will be transacting with each other and alsoserving the Lord, while enjoying infinite happiness.

Advaita does not accept such mukti where duality persists; and sincethey are not part of the 14 lokas ofthe bhoutika prapanca they are notaccepted in that category also.udaramantaram kurute athathasya bhayam bhavati - even a spec of difference will cause fear and therefore samsara, andhence as per advaita there isno freedom from samsara even in VaikunTa. Such conditioned freedom is not accepted by Advaita even under karma mukti also.
Just my 2c.
Hari Om!
