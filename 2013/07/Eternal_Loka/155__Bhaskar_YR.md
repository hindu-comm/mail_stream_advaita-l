However, the names and forms of devas, brahmaloka etc. described in the 
eternal shruti re-emerge as before.

I failed to understand why we have to stick to the theory of eternality of 
lOka-s (kailAsa or vaikunTa)  & argue on this point endlessly  when the 
advaitin's goal is NOT exactly residing in eternal lOka-s and enjoying the 
close association with either nArAyaNa or nAgabhUshaNa :-)).  Though, per 
chance,  we might get a licence to stay in permanent lOka-s & the bhOga 
therein, that would not anyway guarantee us the Atmaikatva jnAna which is 
the ultimate goal of  jignAsu in jnAna mArga.  Hence, our aim should be to 
realize our svarUpa jnAna which is devoid of any nAma & rUpa (prAkrutik or 
aprAkrutic of celestial beings). 


And just to accommodate these lOka-s & its eternality and move on with 
advaita prakriya, we could say, these lOka-s are comparatively more 
lasting than bhUlOka and in krama mukti through dhyAnOpAsanAdi sAdhana 
jeeva would attain these lOka-s & might be the  proximate of his/her 
ishtadevata (sAlOkya, sArUpya, sAyujya etc.)  but it is not anyway 
analogous to Atmaikatva adviteeya paramArtha jnAna which is the 
paramasiddhAnta of shruti / advaita vedAnta.

Just my few thoughts on this.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
