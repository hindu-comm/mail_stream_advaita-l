There are some problems in such a thinking.  All the bodies, Rama, Krishna,
etc. appeared at a particular point of time and also disappeared after the
purpose for which they specifically appeared.  The Lord Himself
acknowledges this in the 4th ch. of the BG: bahUni mE vyatItAni janmAni tava
cha arjuna....Many lives of Mine have passed...also yours....A 'janma'
cannot be without a body and that is what the Lord, as Parameswara, is
referring to here.  We cannot say that those bodies are eternal any more
than the bodies of humans, however exalted they might have been.  Even
today, and all times to come, such great personalities who have lived and
passed away, can be related to/with by devotees.  They appear in the
waking, in forms of visions, and in dreams too, to bless these devotees.
So are the forms of Rama, Krishna, etc.  It is only in that way their
bodies can be said to be eternal.  An ardent devotee has every right to
hold his Acharya to be an avatAra.  He might very strongly argue that his
Acharya descended on this earth to  bless him and others and that his birth
is not karma-driven.  Such beliefs will certainly give some benefits to the
person who holds them.


Krishna might get the status of pravAha nityatva just because his name
appears in the Chandogya upanishad.  What about Rama and Buddha (who is
also acknowledged as an avatAra) and parashurama and balarAma whose names
are not mentioned in the popular upanishads? Would we hold Kapila's body
(of the bhAgavatam) too to be eternal?  The vAmana, an avatAra of the Lord,
itself came to an end when it transformed to Trivikrama.   Then we will
have to hold each of the stages of Krishna, bAlakrishna, gopikrishna,
parthasarathy, etc. as eternal bodies.
