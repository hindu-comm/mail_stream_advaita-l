English translation by Swami Gambhirananda (on Sri Sankaracharya's Sanskrit
Commentary)

7.24 Abuddhayah, the unintelligent, the non-discriminating ones; ajanantah,
unaware; mama, of My; param, supreme; bhavam, state, My reality as the
supreme Self; which is avyayam, immutable, undecaying; and anuttanam,
unsurpassable; manyante, think; mam, of Me; as avyaktam, the unmanifest,
the invisible; Apannam, that has become; vyaktim, manifest, visible, at
present  At present, after being embodied as an Incarnation.- though I am
the ever well-known God. *They think so because they are unaware of My
reality.* This is the idea.What is the reason for their ignorance? This is
being stated:

Sanskrit commentary by Sri Sankaracharya
-- अव्यक्तम् अप्रकाशं व्यक्तिम् आपन्नं प्रकाशं गतम् इदानीं मन्यन्ते मां
नित्यप्रसिद्धमीश्वरमपि सन्तम् अबुद्धयः अविवेकिनः परं भावं परमात्मस्वरूपम्
अजानन्तः अविवेकिनः मम अव्ययं व्ययरहितम् अनुत्तमं निरतिशयं मदीयं भावमजानन्तः
मन्यन्ते इत्यर्थः।।तदज्ञानं किंनिमित्तमित्युच्यते -- ।।7.24।।

The Lord is distinguishing between His body in this avatAra and His
transcendental BrahmasvarUpa which does not undergo any change.  So, the
censure here is of those who do not know this clear distinction.  This
verse of the Lord Himself in the 4.5 will make this clear:

4.5 O Arjuna, bahuni, many; janmani, lives; me, of Mine; vyatitani, have
passed; tava ca, and so have yours. Aham, I; veda know; tani, them;
sarvani, all; (but) tvam, you; va vetta, know not, due to your power of
understanding being obstructed by righteousness, unrighteousness, etc.
However, parantapa, O scorcher of foes; aham, I know, possessing as I do
unobstructed power of knowledge, because by nature I am enternal, pure,
enlightened and free.'In that case, how, in spite of the absence of
righteousness and unrighteousness, can there be any birth for You who are
the eternal God?'That is beng answered:

Sanskrit commentary by Sri Sankaracharya
-- बहूनि मे मम व्यतीतानि अतिक्रान्तानि जन्मानि तव च हे अर्जुन। तानि अहं वेद
जाने सर्वाणि न त्वं वेत्थ न जानीषे, धर्माधर्मादिप्रतिबद्धज्ञानशक्तित्वात्।
अहं पुनः नित्यशुद्धबुद्धमुक्तस्वभावत्वात् अनावरणज्ञानशक्तिरिति वेद अहं हे
परंतप।।कथं तर्हि तव नित्येश्वरस्य धर्माधर्माभावेऽपि जन्म इति, उच्यते --
।।4.5।।

The Lord Himself acknowledges that His several bodies too have passed.  In
that respect, He sees no difference between His several bodies (in several
avataras)  and Arjuna's several bodies in several lives.
