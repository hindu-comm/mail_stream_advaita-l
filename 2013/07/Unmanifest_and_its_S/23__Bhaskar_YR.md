but Krishna's form is aprakrta mayarUpam and imperishable.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

In bhAgavata itself we have ample evidence to show that krishna is devaki 
suta, yashOda nandana with some super human powers and after more than a 
century he shed his physical body by showing his leg to the hunter and 
arjuna performed the last rights (antyeshti) to the 'shareera' of krishna 
and after the disappearance of physical form of krishna the yAdava 
kulaja-s engaged themselves in famous yAdavi kalaha...Anyway, if he wishes 
even now 21st century, kaliyuga,  he can still show then existing (in 
dvApara yuga)  krishna's form to his devotees like all other famous gods 
(rAma, Anjaneya, devi mAta)  & saints (sri rAghavendra swamiji / sai bAba 
etc.) doing at various point of time. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
