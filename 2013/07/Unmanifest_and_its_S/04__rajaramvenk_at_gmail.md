Normally, people think that the body of Krishna was non-existent (avyaktam) and it became existent (vyaktim) during avatara. It will again become non-existent after the avatara ends. However, Krishna asserts that it is foolish (abuddhayah) to think so. In gaudiya vaishnavism, Krishna, like the sun, is ever existent in His transcendental body (param bhavam anuttamam avyayam) that fools don't understand. Madhusudana also uses the sun example. In advaita, Krishna exists as brahman (param bhavam anuttamam avyayam) and appears in the same form as before. In that sense His body was never non-existent and will never be non-existent. However, between avataras an advaitin should think that His body is non-existent. Is it not? Then an advaitin is also open to the  abuddhayah charge by Krishna. Is it not?
