Namaste

Book Micro economic Theory by Walter Nicholson page 9 -

'For example, St. Thomas Aquinas believed value to be divinely determined.
Since
prices were set by humans, it was possible for the price of a commodity to
differ
from its value. A person accused of charging a price in excess of a good’s
value was
guilty of charging an “unjust” price. For example, St. Thomas believed the
“just”
rate of interest to be zero.'

In Muslim religion also they say you should not charge any interest for
loans.

Like this is there any Dharma Sastra rule in Hinduism for charging interest
on loans?


My wife's cousin's grand father was very religious Brahmin but he was money
lender. He was charging heavy interest to all people.
