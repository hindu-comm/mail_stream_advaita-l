Namaste,

Sir, artha purushartha has to be attained viaappropriate 
efforts, directed karma. It may be okay to take guidance
from an astrologer if repeated efforts fail. But using
jyotisha tomake money in stock market willbe against the
dharma purushartha.

This view of yours fits both within dharma and maryAdA
purushartha-s.Man-woman relationship finds place in advanced 
vidya-s like panchAgni vidyA of bRhadAraNyaka upaniSad.
This topic though better not be openly discussed.
