If you read JMV or other works of Shankaracharya like the 'sarva vedanta
siddhanta sara sangraha' you will find multiple methods to control lust.
One popular vedantic method, of the BG, too, is to engage in doSha
darshanam.  By contemplating on the faults of desireful activity and the
objects of desire, one will develop dispassion towards desireful activity
and the objects.  But each person's proclivity is not the same.  So
different methods, a combination of them, is offered.  'haripada bhajanam'
is another method to take the mind off desire/objects.  No single method
can be complete by itself.  viveka is the supreme method but even to get
that other methods might become necessary.
