I do not know if it is a derived term, but in the Apte English-Sanskrit
dictionary we have entries: ’interest: वृद्धिः, वार्द्धुष्यम्,  'simple
interest: सरलवृद्धिः, compound interest: चक्रवृद्धिः, ’interest at 5% =
पंचकेन शतेन, पंचकशतम्, पंचोत्तरं शतम् .

I think the Tamil and Kannada words 'vaDDi/baDDi' to denote interest have
their roots in the Sanskrit word 'vRddhiH' which means
'growth/multiplication' of money.

Meadows Taylor tells us: "The laws of Manu disclose how thoroughly the
scheme of banking was known 3,000 years ago. The bankers understood and
followed the fluctuations of money value; they kept account-books,
day-books, and ledgers by single and double entry. They charged interest
simple and compound, they made insurance by sea and land, they granted
bills of ex­change, and in short, they followed the practices of modern
times which are little changed from ancient rules." - See more at:
