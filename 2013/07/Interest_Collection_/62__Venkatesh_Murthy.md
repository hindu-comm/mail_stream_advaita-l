The Moksha Purushartha is telling us everything is temporary. All the
Dharma, Artha and Kama activities will be there for us to get the balance
of Mind. If there is good balance of Mind the person will understand
everything in the world is temporary. It is Vyavaharika. There will be true
Vairagya.

But if a person not having proper balance of Mind thinks everything is
temporary it is not correct. He can say why should I work? Why should I do
my duties as householder? The world is not real. I will not work. This is
Smashaana Vairagya like Vairgagya when some one dies and we are in a
Smashaana. We have to avoid this Smashaana Vairagya.

There should be balanced views of Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha for
Pravrutti Margis.
