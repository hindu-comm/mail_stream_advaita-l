I presume your ultimate interest in asking this question was whether a certain act ( in this case charging interest) is conducive to getting into pravritti marga or nivritti marga.

That was a really nice article and thanks for the pointer. The key observation in the article is

".....it causes a rise in the demand for money that the Fed will almost certainly accommodateâ€“and rightfully so, for refusing to do so almost always serves to punish those already in the weakest position."

So it is the Fed (I will call it Central bank so as not to be country-specific) is what actualizes inflation; and it need not be confined to the four pre-conditions (not causes really) prevailing. For example how about printing money to meet the deficit arising because of loan waiver to a section of the society? ... and so on.

Worse still, what if the Central Bank is not strong enough to to ensure that it benefits the weakest section, but a powerful lobby?

The point is a person depending upon who his Central Bank is and what is his perception on it is obliged to take a position on inflation; which means worrying about the morrow and bang goes nivritti marga out of the window!

Of course in happy circumstances in which inflation is used to subsidize nivritti marga ( can happen in countries with a dominant religion), it could be opposite!

Manu Smriti or any other Smriti which does not address the socio-economic reality, is to that extent irrelevant in providing a consistent supportive model.

So, the bottom line seems to be, "how do I judge whether an action of mine pushes me into pravritti marga or nivritti marga?"

Any simple answers??

Regards
Rangarathnam
