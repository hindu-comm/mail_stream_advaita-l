There is an Anjaneya Mantra called "madana kSObha nivAraNa mantra".

The japa of that hanumad mantra protects the upAsaka from 
kAma pralObha and swapna-veerya-skhalana.

In AdhyAtmika sAdhana, brahmacharya siddhi is most important without which
one can't progress.  

One should also be careful in AhAra and vihAra.  Onions & garlic should be shunned.

There is a good book by Swami Sivananda Ji called "Practice of Brahmacharya".
Very beautiful book for sadhakas.

regs,
sriram
