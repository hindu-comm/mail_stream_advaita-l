Is there any astrological combinations that are conducive to progress in sadhana?

I think 4planets in the tenth house, 5th lord in the 12th house are some favorable dispositions.
Ketu ( kaivalyakaraka) and Rahu (atmakaraka) are also said to be empowered to hand down mano nasa.

Any snippets/nuggets of information in this regard will be appreciated!

I tried to see if jyotisha can be used to do it. I couldn't find an astrologer who can take up the challenge :) If Vedas and Vedangas don't serve a practical purpose, most people aren't going to give a damn really. In fact, most traditionalists send their kids to modern education and rightfully so because science produces practical results.

IMO, we have to deal with women as per dharma.  DharmAvirodha kAmOsmi says the Lord. If you satisfy kAmA properly in a marriage, then you won't have a repressed society. While UK allows marriage at 16, India doesn't until 18.

One popular jnAni is claimed to have said that he was overwhelmed by lust.  I understand avidya lesha but don't want too many jnAnis walking around with uncontrolled kAmA - a fair ask I presume :)
