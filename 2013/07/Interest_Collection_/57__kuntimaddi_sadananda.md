PraNAms to all. 

Vidyaji has presented the essential truth. If one has the correct vision of Vedanta, every other thing falls in its place considering the prevailing circumstances/environment. Relative roles are relative as long they are made in tune with thevision of theabsolute.

>1. pravRtti and nivRtti are meant for individuals, but the same person can transition
>from pravRtti to nivRtti. There is no question of perfect balance in four purushArtha-s.
>There has to be balance of three for people in society, namely dharma, artha and kAma.
>An over-emphasis on moksha can be injurious for those in pravRtti mArga. However, if
>one is serious about moksha, then nivRtti mArga dictates that artha and kAma first have
>to be left behind, not brought along, in some misplaced sense of balance. For a single-

>Far from a situation of balance among four goals, moksha as a goal stands alone,
>separate from the other three, not with them. In fact, a lot of problems arise precisely
>because people want to talk about moksha but are not ready to leave the other three
>purushArtha-s behind. If this basic requirement is not understood, then one is not even
>ready for the A B Cs of vedAnta.
