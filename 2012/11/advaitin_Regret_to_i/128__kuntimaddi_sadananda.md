PraNAms to all. 

Shree Devanathan and I had extensive discussions on Saakshii swaruupam and related discussions on Advaita Makaranda text by Shree Lakshmidhara Kavi - couple of years ago. As I gather, he was proponent of Bhamati school and was providing for us different prerspectives from his point. He was contributing both to the advaitin and advaitaL lists. We are going to miss him.

Hari Om!
