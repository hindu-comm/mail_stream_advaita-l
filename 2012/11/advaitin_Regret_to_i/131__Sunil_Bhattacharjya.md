I have not known him personally yet it appeared to me that he would continue to be a good contributor to the Advita groups. My condolences to the members of his family. Let Lord Krishna give them strength to bear this loss.

I express my heart-felt condolences to the members and his bereaved family. I knew him from his PG days at the department of philosophy, University of Madras, where I was pursuing my studies as his senior. Before he joined Toronto, he sent me photostat of two books- AAtmabodhaprakaraNa, IISvarapratipattiprakASa by MadhusUdana SarasvatI, while he needed a photocopy of Advaita VedAnta and VaiSnavism by Sanjukta Gupta. Many more sweet memories to be reckoned with.
A great loss of a promising scholar and a true lover of Advaita.

Best rgs,
N.Saha

He used to say that he will live a short life of 30 odd years. He also used
to say that his life is one long holiday. He used to remember his
grandmother whose singing had such a positive influence on him. He used to
consider sringeri aacharyal, swami paramathananda and sri mani dravid
sastrigal as his gurus. If there was praptam, he was intending to take
sannyasa and also help people as long as he lived. I learnt a lot from him.
It is a great loss.
