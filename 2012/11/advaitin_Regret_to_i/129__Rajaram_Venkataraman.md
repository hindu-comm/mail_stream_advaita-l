He used to say that he will live a short life of 30 odd years. He also used
to say that his life is one long holiday. He used to remember his
grandmother whose singing had such a positive influence on him. He used to
consider sringeri aacharyal, swami paramathananda and sri mani dravid
sastrigal as his gurus. If there was praptam, he was intending to take
sannyasa and also help people as long as he lived. I learnt a lot from him.
It is a great loss.
