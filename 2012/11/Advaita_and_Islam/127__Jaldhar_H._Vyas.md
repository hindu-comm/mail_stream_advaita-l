It is not a matter of approving of it but the conceptual differences are 
so great.  The various nastika mats may have had different views on karma, 
mukti etc. but atleast they had views.  Now you can certainly criticize 
the effects of Islam (On a case by case basis.) but what debate can you 
have about its concepts? They are indeed adharmic.  Saying anything more 
than that is shouting not debate.

Advaitins are supposed to be out to conquer ignorance and I'm sorry to say 
that this idea that mainstream Christians and Muslims are 
"misunderstanding" their religion at the behest of later, selfish, priests 
has no factual basis whatsover.  Treading the path of those religions 
will not result in jnana because their God insists against jnana and 
demands an exlusive, dualistic relationship.  If there are individual 
Muslims or Christians who wish to transcend that then all well and good 
but they (and especially we) need to understand that they are deviating 
from the mainstream of their faiths.
