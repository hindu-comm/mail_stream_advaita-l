The copy of ancient bhagavat gita is with me and i have gone through it. An IAS officer turned self-styled god man in Hyderabad hadpublished the telugu version. Here it is:

http://books.google.co.in/books/about/Ancient_Bhagavad_Gita.html?id=d9MfAAAAIAAJ

Nothing much to learn from this publication except negative remarks and comments on our traditional scholars. He says thatthe prakshipta in BG was noticed byShri Abhinava Gupta and Bhagavat Ramanuja. Ramanuja seems to have commented on the sangraha bhAga, the copy of which he receivedYamunacharya.

So, nothing much to learn fromthe prakshiptAs. 

That said, to "understand the available text of BG correctly" by understanding the Acharya hridaya itself would take one's lifetime. Prof. VK Ji narrated anincident to us sometime back. 

When a certain scholar approached Shri Tethiyur Sastrigal for clarification and said "shastrigal ! i have not understood 3 slokas of BG ; kindly explain them".

Shri Tethiyur Sastrigal exclaimed that it is good that you have understood rest of the 697 slokas whereas i am struggling with all the 700 slokas to understand !! 

regs,
sriram
