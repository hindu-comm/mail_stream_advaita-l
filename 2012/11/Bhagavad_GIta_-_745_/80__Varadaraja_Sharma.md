Radhe Krishna

I am sorry that I should have waited searched and should have given the additional information in my last mail.

Well, I was able to search the further discussion on the issue.  But alas, again the discussion ends up with 715 verses.  But the discussion again on the related topic, I hope would be of interest to readers.

Sorry, for rushing up with another mail.  Hope I have not exceeded the limits, if any, fixed by the list.

Radhe Krishna
