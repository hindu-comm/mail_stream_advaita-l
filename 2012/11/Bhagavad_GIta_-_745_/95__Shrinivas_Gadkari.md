Namaste,

Adding to what Shri Vidyasankar has already very well explained.

Let us also not forget, that Shri Shankara had personally met veda
vyAsa. This should be enough to convince us that the version of 
gItA that Shri Shankara commented on and subsequently popularized
is the version that veda vyAsa himself wanted to be spread among
the people.

Regards,
Shrinivas

Don't you think he had to have known the gItA by heart, backwards and forwards, 
before he even started writing his commentary? What is much more likely is 
this - whatever version of the gItA was taught to him by his gurus, that was 
the text he commented upon, period. 


Regards,
Vidyasankar
