There is a similar controversy with the Durga Saptashati or Chandi Patha 
which as the name suggests, should contain 700 shlokas but instead has 
somewhat less.  Commentators like Shri Bhaskara Raya get around this by 
counting each uvAcha (and also namah in "yA devI sarvabhuteShu...") as a 
separate mantra.

Could some enterprising person count up the number of uvAcha's in the Gita 
and see if it adds up to 45?
