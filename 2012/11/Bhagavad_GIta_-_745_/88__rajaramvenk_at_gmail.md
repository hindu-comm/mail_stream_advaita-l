Like we say Vishnu Sahasranamam but actually its fewer than 1000. Why can't it be that Shankaracharya was giving approximate estimate?

Namaste,

Acharya Sankara in His introduction BG bhASya says:

// taM dharmaM bhagavatA yathOpadiSTaM vEdavyAsa sarvajnO bhagavatgItAkhai 
SAPTHABHIRSLOKA-SHATAIH upanibabandha //

So, Acharya Sankara accepts the pramANa of 700 slokas only. 

Mahamahopadhyaya Bulusu Appanna Sastry Garu comments that even if there are pATa bhEdAs in BG, they should be considered as prakSiptAs only and can be fairly ignored.

regs,
sriram
