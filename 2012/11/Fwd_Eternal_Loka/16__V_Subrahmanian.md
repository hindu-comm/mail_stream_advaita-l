According to Advaita, on the basis of the Upanishads, everyone is an
'incarnation' of Brahman.  Yet all these jiva-s have to put in efforts to
attain jnanam and through that, moksha. In the Bhagavatam itself soon after
janma, Krishna addresses Devaki-Vasudeva that you have been giving birth to
Me for the last three births of yours but failed to know Me. That shows
that Devaki-Vasudeva couple are jiva-s in ignorance.

Narada is an aspirant of Jnana, himself declaring: I am miserable as I do
not know My self.  And seeks instruction from Sanatkumara in the Chandogya
Upanishad seventh chapter.

For Vyasa, Shankara says: A sage named 'apAntaratamas' incarnated as Vyasa
at the confluence of the Dvapara and Kali yugas. He is an AdhikArika
puruSha according to Shankara in the BSB.  Such a person is a jivanmukta
with special portfolio till his prarabdha karma exhausts and thereafter a
videha mukta.

Shuka according to the Jivanmukti viveka of Vidyaranya Swamin was first
instructed on Self-knowledge by his father Vyasa himself but as he was not
getting the conviction he was sent by Vyasa to Janaka.  Upon being
instructed by Janaka Shuka became enlightened.

Parikshit, owing to a curse, renounced his kingdom and sought to hear the
Bhagavat tattvam from Shuka muni and finally got it.

Swami Paramarthananda has spoken about the Gopi-s alone, as per my
listening to his Uddhavagita lectures.

We have discussed this enough before and there is no point in going into it
again.  You can study the sub-commentaries for the above Gita verse.

Let them engage so.  That does not contradict the Turiya state of the
Upanishadic teaching.  The idea of Shiva and Vishnu duality persists in the
pre-Turiya states alone.   We have examples of one jivanmukta engaging in
devotion of another one, alive or not, both being well aware that their
bodies are unreal.  What is required for such practices is a body.  And a
body for Brahman is not admitted in the Upanishads as an absolute reality.
