Dear Friends,

I have a question.

The mind and intellect are part of the subtle body in vedanta. Could
someone please tell me if they occupy a particular region of space
such as


mind lives in the subtle part of the physical heart and

intellect in the subtle part of the physical brain.

Chakras are part of the subtle body and occupy regions in space
occupied by the physical body. For example my muladhara chakra will
not be miles away in space from the physical body although it is
subtle body. In fact it is situated near the navel of my physical
body.

Similarly, does the mind exist in the subtle body close to where the
physical heat is???

and doe the intellect exist in the subtle part of the physical brain??????


In other words does the subtle body exist as an aura in the same space
as the physical body???????


The self I have heard is the size of the thumb and exists in the same
space as the physical body???????


Please forgive my utter ignorance.

With a wish to know,

Vijaya Kambhampati.
