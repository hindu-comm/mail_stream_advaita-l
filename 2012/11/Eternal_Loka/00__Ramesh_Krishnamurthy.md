On the one hand, you present bhakti as a "loving relationship" and
then you also say that it does not require bheda. If "gopaloham" is
strictly valid then there is no question of *any* relationship, leave
alone a loving relationship between gopAla and me, because gopAla is
me. This is why I have repeatedly pointed out that terms like bhakti
are used contextually and have a range of meanings.

A "loving relationship" with the deity is not mokSha as far as
advaita-vedAnta is concerned. It can be a sAdhana but even here it is
not a substitute for j~nAna.
