even in jivan mukti, he does not think I am different. The existence of his
body does not affect a uttama bhakta's atma jnanam. His bhagavad bhakti and
atma jnanam do not affect each other as we see in atmaramas verse as well
as practically in the lives of Sridhara, Madhusudana, Sadasiva Brahmendral,
Bhogendrl, Sringeri Periyava etc. We see from the rasa schemes of both
Madhusudana and Sridhra, Bhakti continues to grow in a jivan mukta. Meera
and Sadasiva Brahmendral composed new poetry sharing new experiences after
jivan mukti. They didn't reject bhagavad bhakti after jivan mukti on the
grounds that Ishwara is a mere illusion though they shunned matrial life.
What is special about this " god delusion", that is acceptable to an
atmarama than attraction to a mohini? What happens to that devotee who is
atma rama but wants only eternal loving devotional service - the lord
cannot override his desire, surely?
