Corvid Sage Bhushunda was (is?) said to have lived through several Mahayugas and the interveining Pralayas.

The question is whether there can be a jnani who will continue
forever in the same or new bodies. I think the answer is yes and is the
case with some types of jnanis who are intense bhagavad bhaktas like Arjuna
who appeared as Nara earlier.

Even if it is yes, I read sometime ago in the Mahabharata that Kapila 
advises against it.
