RV: In SBh 10.3.7 - 8, it is said that Devaki is (devakyam deva-rupinyam)
sakshat Hari. In SBh 12.13.19, it is said that Brahma, Narada, Vyasa, Sukha
and Parikshit are avatars of Hari only. In SBh 12.8.32, it is said that
Nara and Narayana are incarnations of Hari only (nara narayano hari:). Most
of these characters are incarnations of Hari Himself. I fail to see any
scriptural support for Swami Paramarthananda's opinion that puranic
characters attained krama mukti.

RV: If your argument is right, then there can no inconceivable form.
Sankara refers to the ever existent inconceivable form of Ishwara (BG
8.9).  Madhusudana clearly says that these forms of the lord are NOT made
of five elements. We only have experience of forms made of five elements.

RV: My main point Siva and Vishnu are not in bondage but they are able to
engage in devotion to each other.
