RV: Mukti pateh tells us that the Lord is the controller of Mukti (even for
the smart ones who meditate on who am I). Please read the next verse
(4.9.30) Dhruva asserts that he had attained the sat padam in six
months that sanakadhis attained in many life times.  So, the Lord gave him
atma jnanam though he never asked him for it. Dhruva also asserts that his
state is superior to that of the Devas (4.9.32), which is possible only for
a jnani. This is also inferred from what the Lord Himself tells him in the
preceding verses (e.g. 4.9.25) that Dhruva, like sanyasis, will attain the
state of Vishnu after this life. He expresses his advaita jnanam in 4.9.33
where he says that the sadness in his heart with respect to enemy is due to
maya only because there is no second person. Most importantly, Maitreya
tells us in 4.9.36 that people like Dhruva who worship the dust at the feet
of Mukunda (the giver of liberation) are satisfied with what comes from
bhagavanugraham and other his "loving devotional service" dont ask for any
thing else.

Regarding Sri Subrahmanian's point that the jnanam of the jnani is
destroyed when the mind is. Does he then place bhakti, a mano vritti, at
the same level as jnanam? Then I agree. Otherwise, I will ask why bhakti is
given a lower status though both bhakti and jnanam are only products of the
mind? Secondly, if we destroy the mirror that reflected the sun, will we
say the sun is destroyed? If bhakti and jnanam are accepted as reflection
of Brahmananda on the mind, albeit through different processes, then the
destruction of the mind at death will be akin to destruction of only
the mirror.

Regarding Sri Ramesh's response on the impossibility of bhakti in abheda
state, please note that bhakti in abheda state is what Sridhara,
Madhusudana and the author of Sivanandalahari say - not me. So, if you
think bhakti iss not possible in abheda state, please ask them. Gopalaham
as a form of devotion is what Gopala Tapani Upanishad teaches - again not
me. Some Gopis become Gopala when others yearn in separation. You will do
well to study Bhakti Rasayana where Madhusudana explains why Bhakti is the
higest goal. And goes further to say that many of the bhakti rasas are
relished only after jivan mukti. Bhakti is not just a preparatory step not
is it  just a carry forward of previous habits in jivan muktas.

Regarding Sri Sunil's point comparison of the relationship between devotees
and the Lord to that between the kidnapped and the kidnapper in stockholm
syndrome, I can only say that the terms mukti-pati, mukunda etc. do not fit
his ingenious comparison.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
