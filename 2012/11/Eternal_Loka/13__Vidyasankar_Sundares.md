> 1. Swami Paramarthananda cannot take a position that contradicts what SBh says with respect to devotees such as Dhruva, Gopis, Janaka etc. Sridhara and Madhusudana call them jnanis of the highest order. A student can be ill-informed but not a teacher. He should be very careful about his utterances. If a teacher is ill-informed, he is a bane of our dharma because he will hold sway over the minds of the best of scholars.

A student may be ill-informed, but precisely because of that,  he should be even more careful about his utterances, for fear of committing aparAdha against teachers. Please do not rush to judgment without reading fully what one or the other teacher has said.
