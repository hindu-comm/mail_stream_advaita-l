partly because of me. The core question is whether an eternal loka albeit
non-different from the lord is admissible in Advaita. 1. I brought up Siva
- Vishnu devotion to show that it is possible. Both have no gaps in
brahmajnanam and are not perishable. 2. I also referred to the usage of
vaikuntha synonymously with the Lord and the Loka in SBh. 3. The reference
to BG 8.9 was also to show Ishwara with inconceivable ETERNAL form exists
according to Sankara. 4. The reference to eka jiva vada is also for the
same reason.

I would like to what you think about eternal loka in Advaita.
