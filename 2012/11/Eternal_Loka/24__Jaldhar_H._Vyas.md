Desire for liberation is a bit of an oxymoron isn't it when it is desire 
which is the cause of bondage in the first place.  But everyone has to say 
atleast "I want jnana."  So Advaita Vedanta acknowledges that but says 
that as the sadhaka advances even that desire will burn away and he will 
just come to mukti as it happens.

It's the same with the bhakta.  Savitri did not "relish" death she was 
just following Satyavan and that is where it led her.  A bhakta is in 
constant communion with his Lord.  That will lead to moksha.  There is no 
desire involved.
