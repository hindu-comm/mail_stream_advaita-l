RV: SBh 3.29.11-12 describes it as manogati. Madhusudana takes it as
manovrtti or the reflection of Lord on melted mind and non-different from
the Lord just as akhandakara vrtti is the reflection Brahman on desireless
mind and non-different from Brahman. Please refer Bhaktirasayana. The
gaudiya vaishnavas also say bhakti is a mano vrtti but say that it is
caused by the antaranga shakti of the Lord, non-different from Him and
personified as Radha. Madhusudana equates bhakti to the Lord Himself.
