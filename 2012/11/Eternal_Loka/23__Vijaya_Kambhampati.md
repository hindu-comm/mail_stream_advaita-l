> 2. Ishwara and Maya are beyond time according Madhusudana. Please give
reasons to say that they are within spacio temporal limitations.

'Beyond time' means 'they are not perishable as other created objects'.


*From Vijaya Kambhampati:*

I agree with the last comment.

Ishwara is brahman seen through Maya by jivas and purusha.
Maya created time and space.

Maya protects (through its very nature) the existence of Ishwara who as a
result lives on forever and is protected by Maya from all destructive
forces.

 Brahman is changeless and maya continues till the jiva realises self as
brahman.So as long as there are any unrealised jivas, then an eternal Loka
with Ishwara in it will exist. But the jiva in it has to live and die and
may experience any loka only as long as his prarabdha will allow him to.

My humble opinion.
Vijaya Kambhampati
