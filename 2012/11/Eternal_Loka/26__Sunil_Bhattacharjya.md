The question is whether there can be a jnani who will continue
forever in the same or new bodies. I think the answer is yes and is the
case with some types of jnanis who are intense bhagavad bhaktas like Arjuna
who appeared as Nara earlier.

Even if it is yes, I read sometime ago in the Mahabharata that Kapila 
advises against it.

RV: I had a few offline discussions with Sri Subrahmanian and agreed to go
through Swami Paramarthananda's lectures. As of now, my position or
understanding is as follows. A person on the nivrtti marga understands the
swarupa of Ishwara, Jagat and Jiva through sravana etc. He comes to the
firm conclusion that only brahman exists and gives up all desires just we
will not have desire for water in a mirage. But due to prarabda karma and
purva karma vasana, his body and mind will continue to act until he attains
videha mukti. If he wants he can stop such activities using yoga processes
such as samyama. In the seven stages of jnana bhumi outlined by
Madhusudana, he can go to the highest stage where no one can wake him up
though his body is alive. Though some have done it, most jnanis work for
lokasamgraha. Some adhikara purushas even continue after the death of the
current body and continue in a new body. But this will also come to an end
after the mission is complete such as ruling as an Indra or writing a
bhashyam. The question is whether there can be a jnani who will continue
forever in the same or new bodies. I think the answer is yes and is the
case with some types of jnanis who are intense bhagavad bhaktas like Arjuna
who appeared as Nara earlier.
