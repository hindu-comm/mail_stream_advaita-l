st slokah of the Ishavasyopanishad staam jagat
states:
"ishavasyamidam sarvam yat kinca jagat!
tena tyaktena bhunjita ma grdhah kayasvid dhanam!!"

Whatsoever in this world,moving or nonmoving is pervaded by the Lord(clothed by the Lord).Therefore,live by giving up(with the idea that all this is clothed,belongs to the Lord).Therefore,donot greed for other's wealth.

The second slokah states:

"Kurvan-eveha karmani jijivishec-chatam samah!
evam tvayi nanyathetosti karma lipyate nare!!"

Only through doing actions here,one should desire to live ha hundred years.There is no other way karma will taint a man.

Sri Shankara explains that the first slokah is for the Sanyasis who should give up the threefold desires of the worldly life,putraishana,vittaishana,and lokaishana--for progeny,desire for wealth and desire for the worlds.The second slokah is for those who are doing karmas and desire to live for hundred years.In this way of doing karmas,man. is not tainted.
N.Srikanta.
