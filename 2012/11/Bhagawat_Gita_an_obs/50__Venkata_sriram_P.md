To add to Shri Subbuji's comment:
You have used the word *insignificant text* while referring Srimat Bhagavat Gitawhich shows how much respect you give to the holy book. 
As regards the commentaries on BG prior to advent of Acharya Sankara,just go through the sentence below from none other than Acharya Sankara Himself:
///
tadarthAviSkaraNAya anEkaiH vivrutapadapadArthavAkyArthanyAyaM api..........ahaM vivEkataH arthanirdhAraNArthaM saMkSEpatO vivaraNaMkariSyAmi
//
Acharya says that even though many scholars have attempted to comment onthe Gita Shastra, i am writing a short commentary on it again to reconcilethe contradictory conclusions being taken by many. 
Acharya further goes saying that *tat cha sarvakarmasanyAsapUrvakAtAtmajnAnaniSTA rUpAt dharmAt bhavati*.
This shows how much respect Acharya Sankara had for Srimad Bhagavat Gita.
So, it is understood from the above statement that commentaries existedprior to Acharya Sankara but went into oblivion and watered down afterAcharya Sankara's commentary.
