Namaste,

Yes, that seems to be true so far as the Bhagavad Gita is concerned. That could also be the reason why the 745 verses of the Bhagavad Gita (as composed by Vedavyasa and also as specifically mentioned by him in the Mahabharata) were trimmed to 700 verses. That justification could have given the necessary freedom to make a vulgate edition with 700 verses, while restricting the availability of the original version only to the advanced spiritual seekers.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Namaste

There are 4 Purusharthas Dharma Artha Kama Moksha and one book for
each. For Dharma there is Manu Smruti with 700 Slokas. For Artha there
is Durga Sapta Shati with 700 Slokas. For Kama there is Kama Sutra
with 700 Slokas. For Moksha there is Bhagavad Gita with 700 Slokas.

Is it true Manu Smruti and Kama Sutra have 700 Slokas?
