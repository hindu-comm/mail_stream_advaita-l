Dear Shri Rajaram,

1)
There is no doubt that the version of the Bhagavad Gita on which Adi Sankaracharya bhashya is based, has 700 verses. That is why he said that the Bhagavad Gita (of course, which he presented) had 700 verses.
2)
That does not mean that Adi Sankaracharya had not edited the Bhagavad Gita of 745 verses. He himself stated clearly why the earlier scholars failed in their attempts to write commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita. After Adi Sankaracharya's work there came out hundreds of people who could write commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita. What do you think, then, is the reason why the earlier scholars could not write commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita? Do you think the scholars earlier to Adi Sankaracharya were not as intelligent as the scholars subsequent to Adi Sankarachaya? 

3)
You cannot brush it aside just casually by saying the mention of the 745 verse as being stray reference and that no other acharya has opposed this as far as I know.Which other acharya prior to Adi Sankaracharya are you referring to? Some of the achatryas subsequent to Adi Sankaracharya were interested only in contesting the interpretations in Adi Sankaracharya's bhashyas and in that too they have failed miserably. However Vedanta Deshika, in spite of belonging to the camp of Ramanujacharya, seems to have believed in the existence of the additional verses. Abhinavagupta quoted some of the rare verses in the Bhagavad Gita.
4)
Further you say the MBH is a highly layered text but you failed to show a single statement in the MBH about the Bhagavad Gita of 700 verses. Do you then mean to say that Bhagavad Gita of 700 verses itself is an interpolation in the MBH?
5)
Lastly have you read yourself the Bhagavad Gita of 745 verses conforming to what MBH mentioned? MBH clearly tells us not only the total number as 745 it also tells us how many verses each of the speakers :Dhritarashtra, Sanjaya, Arjuna and Lord Krishna spoke. 


It is painful to see your casual statement, without any basis. "Ignorance is bliss" for the one who is not aware of the subject and it is easy for such one to brush aside certain discussions as gossip and unproductive.


Sincerely,
Sunil KB

I agree. Shankara has said that BG has 700 verses. No other acharya has opposed this as far as I know. 

MBh is a highly layered text and a stray reference to 745 verses cannot be taken as scholarly.
