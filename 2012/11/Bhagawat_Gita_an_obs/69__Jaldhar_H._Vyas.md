No.

As was mentioned in this thread Shankaracharya himself mentions that there 
were many commentaries in existence in his time; enough to cause confusion 
as to the true tatparya of the Gita which is why he intended to write a 
concise clarification.

Actually the Vishistadvaita tradition also provides evidence of ancient 
commentators (though naturally favoring their views.)

This is a post-19th century phenomenon only stemming from the urge of the 
reformers to have a "Hindu Bible."  But that doesn't mean it was obscure 
before.

Shankaracharya hardly picked it out of a hat.  As was mentioned by Shri 
Subrahmanian elsewhere in this thread, the Brahmasutras themselves quote 
the Gita.  The central issue amongst early Mimamsakas was what is the 
ultimate purport of the Vedas?  kevalakarma (karma is supreme - Purva 
Mimamsakas) kevalajnana (jnana is supreme - Advaita Vedantins) or 
jnanakarmasamucchaya (some kind of combination of karma and jnana - every 
other Vedantin.)  The Gita presents the crux of this issue with vivid 
urgency.  This is what has attracted so many thinkers to it. 
Abhinavagupta, a Shaiva, even wrote a tika on it!
