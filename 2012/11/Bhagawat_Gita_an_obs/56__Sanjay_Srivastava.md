I have not heard from anywhere else if Swami Vivekananda indeed held such
views.

Anyway, had Gita been written by Sri Shankaracharya, he could have given it
unequivocal advaita flavour to rule out any possibility of dvaita or
vishistadvaita interpretation. The fact that later commentators were able
to give valid and plausible dvaita and vishistadvaita interpretation to
Gita should set at rest any speculation about its origin.
