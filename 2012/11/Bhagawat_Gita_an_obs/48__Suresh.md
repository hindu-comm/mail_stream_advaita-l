Namaste,

Is it true that the Gita was an insignificant text until Adi Sankar commented on it? There aren't many commentaries on it prior to his, probably because no saint or scholar thought it worth his time. But once Sankar wrote his commentary, it has almost become a tradition for every school to write one. Today Gita and Hinduism have become synonymous.

My question, however, is, why would Sankar choose such an insignificant text when the Upanishads were much more respected and valued? If he had to, why not something else (like yoga vasista or something with a more advaitic tilt)?
