By the way, it could be also Adi Shankara, who edited the Bhagavad Gita of 745 verses and made it into 700 verses-long in order to make it such that it would be understood easily by the people, particularly at a time when the Buddhists were against the Vedic teachings, (though Lord Buddha himself was not against the Veda). Some of the verses like the one, which says that a Jnani can do anything and yet he (the Jnani ) would not be affected by his karma, may make some persons wonder if the Jnani can get away with by doing a prohibited action too. Such a person would not care to realise that a Jnani's Jnana would not permit the Jnani to do anything against Lokasamgraha.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Bhagawat Gita an obscure text?

To add to Shri Subbuji's comment:
You have used the word *insignificant text* while referring Srimat Bhagavat Gitawhich shows how much respect you give to the holy book. 
As regards the commentaries on BG prior to advent of Acharya Sankara,just go through the sentence below from none other than Acharya Sankara Himself:
///
tadarthAviSkaraNAya anEkaiH vivrutapadapadArthavAkyArthanyAyaM api..........ahaM vivEkataH arthanirdhAraNArthaM saMkSEpatO vivaraNaMkariSyAmi
//
Acharya says that even though many scholars have attempted to comment onthe Gita Shastra, i am writing a short commentary on it again to reconcilethe contradictory conclusions being taken by many. 
Acharya further goes saying that *tat cha sarvakarmasanyAsapUrvakAtAtmajnAnaniSTA rUpAt dharmAt bhavati*.
This shows how much respect Acharya Sankara had for Srimad Bhagavat Gita.
So, it is understood from the above statement that commentaries existedprior to Acharya Sankara but went into oblivion and watered down afterAcharya Sankara's commentary.
