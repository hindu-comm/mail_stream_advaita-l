Namaste,

Beautiful analysis subbuji.I was explaining the point from"nAda-bindu upaniSad".

//

tatvad satyaM avijnAya jagat paSyati mUDadhIH
rajjukhaNDE parijnAtE sarpa rUpaM na niSTAti...............27

With the lack of knowlege ofEternal Truth which is the substratum, 
the ignorant perceive the World to be real. However, with the knowledge
of the Rope which is the Substratum, the illusory perception of Snake is
sublated.

adhiSTAnE tathA jnAtE prapanchE shUnyatAM gatE
dEhasyApi prapanchatvAt prArabdhAvasthitiH krutaH.............28

After the sublation offalse knowledge, the physical frame continues to exist.
This existence of physicalbody is due to the prArabdha. 

ajnAna jana bOdhArthaM prArabdhaM iti cha uchyatE
tataH kAlavashAt Eva prArabdhE tu kSayaM gatE................29

However, the word prArabdha is coined and explained to educate
the ignorant people to understand the existence of jnAni's physical frame
which drops off as soon as the prArabdha is exhausted.

regs,
sriram
