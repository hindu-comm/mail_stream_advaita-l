*OM
The one who gains ATMA jnAnam knows clearly that he is neither a doer or an
enjoyer!! Thereby one gts into the orbit of 'naishkarmya siddhI' and a
JIVAN MUKTAH.
PrasthAna thriyA clearly indicates that such a jiva lives in this body to
exhaust the prArabDA and he/she does not take birth again!!!
This is advaita siddhI.
