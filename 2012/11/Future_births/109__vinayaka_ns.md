Namaste,

Excellent write up! Thanks much for sharing. The following shloka of
aparOkshAnubhUti is worth noting:

AtmAnam satatam jAnan kAlam naya mahAdyute
praarabdhamakhilam bhunjan na udvegam kartumarhasi

//Keeping the Self-knowledge alive always, pass the rest of the life, O
Intelligent one! Experiencing the prArabdha in its entirety, do not give
room
for grief/anger.//

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
