As per tradition, both sringeri periyavas mentioned were jivan muktas.

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Future births

Namaste,

On what basis is one being classified as a jnani? Jivanmukti or the
ability to enter Nirvikalpa samadhi or anything else? For example,
Jagadguru Chandrasekhara Bharati was a Jivanmukta whereas his disciple
Jagadguru Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji though not being a
Jivanmukta(Plz correct me if I'm wrong here) had attained the
capability to enter Nirvikapla samadhi at a young age. To my knowledge
both the Guru & Shishya are Jnanis. Now how does this rule of
Prarabdha apply to them? Is it that the body ceases to exist
immediately after that particular janma only for the Jivanmukta while
few more janmas are required for a jnani who isn't a jivanmukta? Br
Pranipata Chaitanya had quoted the following elsewhere in this thread-

Among other places, in commentary to BG verse 13.23 - saH na bhUyaH
abhijAyate -- you will find this matter discussed where pUrvapakShi
argues it might require minimum 3 more future births got GYAni to
exhaust all prArabdha.

So, is this applicable for a jnani who isn't a Jivanmukta?

Regards,

Abhishek Madhyastha
