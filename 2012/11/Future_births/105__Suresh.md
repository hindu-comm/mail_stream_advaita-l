Namaste,

Advaitin scholars say karma will last even after realization, just as a fan continues running for a few more seconds after it is switched off. But with respect to life, how long is this 'running' of karma supposed to happen? If a lay person understands, at least theoretically, that Brahman is the one reality, will his residual karma last that particular lifetime only (which means he will be liberated after this birth), or many lifetimes?

In dvaita, there are supposed to be hundreds of future births even after realization, since it is god who will determine your fate. I am assuming it is different in advaita but would like clarification.

Regards,
Suresh
