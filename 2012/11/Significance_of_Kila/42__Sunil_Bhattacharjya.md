Namaste,

Can we say in short as follows:


1)
Keelakam probably means locking or locking up.
2)
The person who chants a verse or verses broadly knows the phala that can be expected. The Phalashruti gives a sort of firm conviction that the phala would certainly come.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Subject: [Advaita-l] Significance of Kilakam.

//
I want to know the significance of "Kilakam" usedwhile chanting many slokas and sahasranamas(Vishnu Sahasranama etc).
//
The word *keelaka* originated from the dhAtu*keela bandhE*.  This the nail / hinge / pivot on whichrests an object. For instance, for the door, the hingeplays a vital role either in opening or closingit. Similarly, when the word *keelana* pointstowards a pada (tattva, to be precise), it impliesthat the sAdhaka or mantra upAsaka shouldtie up his mind or hold on to that concept withutmost concentration because it is the tattvapointed by the keelaka shabda which opensthe gate of mantra rahasya. 
The word *beeja* is the seed or sourcewhich denotes the origin of the mantraand goads the upAsaka to dissolve hismind into that.
The word *shakti* is the power of anugrahaor sankalpa shakti which is encapsuledin the mantra.
If we take the example of shiva panchAkSarimahAmantra, *Om* is the beeja which denotesthe source of the mantra; *namaH* denotesthe shakti of the mantra and *shivAya* is thekeelaka of the mantra to which the upAsakahas to hook on his mind which is quite obviousie., the shiva tattva which plays the pivotalrole in the panchAkshari mantra.
//
And also important aspect I want to know is,do we need to chant Phala Shruthi as a part of Nitya Parayana.
//
Chanting of phala-shruti is a good practice howevernot mandatory as a part of nitya pArAyaNa. 
Ishwara knows what is good and what is not for us.
