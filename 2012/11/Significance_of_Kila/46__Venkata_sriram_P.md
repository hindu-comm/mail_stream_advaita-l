//
Keelakam probably means locking or locking up.
//

If you have the lock & key with yourself, the same can be used for locking as well as
unlocking the door !. 

The upAsana phala is hidden from undesirable elements 
lest the mantra may fall into the undesirable hands which could be misused. 

So, the same logic applies here too. There is an *ut-keelana* procedure mentioned 
in tantra shAstra. Apart from these, mantrOddipana paddhati & mantra kulluka paddhati
have been mentioned in tantra. 

There are several ut-keelana paddhatis mentioned like sapthasathi utkeelana vidhAna,
chOra gaNapati mantra vidhAna etc. 

regs,
sriram
