Namaste,

//
'namaH' in this mantra denotes salutation to the Lord Shiva
//

Om, swAhA,swadhA, vaSaT, namaH - these 5 are para-brahma vAchakAs. 

Hence, in namaka pATa of shatarudirya, namaH is invoked which points towards
the parabrahman in the form of Shiva. 

There are various pratArAs of shuddha panchAkSari as per *shiva-panchAkSari mahAkalpa prayOga* which is the form of kumAra (skanda) & agastya saMvAda.
In one of the variations, *namaH* is said to be keelaka.

Now, why namaH is considered to be shakti here is to say that this parabrahma vAchaka
shakti severs the pAsa of the pashu in the form of jiva and makes him pashupati in the form of shiva. And hence, namaH is considered to be the shakti here which severs the pashu pAsha.

This is the underlying principle even in namaka pATa also.

regs,
sriram
