I just happened to come across a very rare video on Youtube at the URL below:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDnGrDMupDc


It depicts the visit of previous Acharya,Sri Abhinava Vidyatheertha Mahaswamigal of Sringeri Sharada Peetam
in 1960 to Sankara Gurukulam in Chennai.

It is so fascinating to see the devotees assembled there in really traditional attire and reminds of how these things have changed so much nowadays.
