Dear All,

The more subtle guna is more powerful and all pervading. While we may
worship the form of a god or goddess, understanding and being one
(ekatvam)with their subtle nature is the end point of even bhakti as we can
help the truth most by being one with it. We may take form and serve the
truth but we have to be one with the subtleness of it and not just live by
grosser rules.

Vijaya Kambhampati.
