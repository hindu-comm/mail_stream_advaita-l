Dear Sri Jaldhar 

As suggested i counted the uvachas and according
to my enumeration,Dhridharashtra 1,Sanjaya 9,Arjuna 21,and Sri Bhaghavan
28 totally 59.So I think the extra slokas are something different.This
is as per Sri RamakrishnaMutt`s edition -in Tamil-containing 700
stanzas.The slokas attributed to the four personalities are 1 to
Dhridharashtra,41 to Sanjaya,85 to Arjuna and 573 are to Sri Bhagavan as
counted by me in the same edition. 

May be some slokas lost while
compiling and editing by the susequent Acharyas.R.Krishnamoorthy.
