Our Father passed away recently. 



>From pAramArthic dRiShti, nothing happened.   As with everything, He was, He is, and He continues to be.



>From vyAvhArik dRiShti, it's an entirely different story.   Duties of a son to his departed father, in addition to overcoming the pain and sorrow, and taking care of mother and adult siblings.



One of the five Maha-yagnas is Pitri-Yagna.   What does this involve?  Any reference?



Also, does the eldest son (or younger sons) have special responsibilities based on Shruti/Smriti to his surviving mother and his younger adult siblings who have their own families and world?



DhanyAvAda,

Sanju
