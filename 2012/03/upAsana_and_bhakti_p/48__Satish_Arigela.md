namaste,

:-) I was using the fire cold example very intentionally. I am well aware of that example and the views of shankara on that.

This example i.e. fire-cold one came up in this list a few years back and I remember benefiting from that discussion.
>Please note that NO advaitin will make such a claim as "fire is cold" based on "scriptures
>and tradition".

I know that. And am also aware that there is a specific way of interpreting such statements which appear contrary to reality.

I was only saying "just like if someone makes a claim like that, it will be not be valid, likewise.. i was trying to convey that one cannot resort to tradition and escape"

This is what I intended to convey.. the fire-cold example was chosen.. only because it will not acceptable to advaitins.
