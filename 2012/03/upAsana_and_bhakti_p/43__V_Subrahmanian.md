This sentence occurs in the bhashya for the BG verse 13.2. It is a very
lengthy commentary and to locate this sentence might be difficult.  If you
have the Chowkhamba edition with 8 commentaries, you can find this sentence
on p. 535.  The sentence as it appears here is slightly changed:

तस्मात् असंप्रदायवित् सर्वशास्त्रविदपि मूर्खवदेव उपेक्षणीयः|
