Namaste Satish,

"The preta-mata [Christians] & the rAkShasa mata could similarly say 
something on these lines quoting their respective books...it is only 
that they cannot prove/verify it.. other than quoting a text"

Not exactly. There is an entire subject that worries about what is provable, what is not, what is axiomatic and so on. What is acceptable as sabda pramana, is based on how it fares with what is verifiable and not otherwise. 

So it might well be okay to say acceptance of Sruti is belief, but for that matter all the upAsana SAstra is based on sabda pramana too. The issue comes when such "belief" has to be based on something that is contrary to what is verifiable, which is the case with abrahamics. 




Shankar
