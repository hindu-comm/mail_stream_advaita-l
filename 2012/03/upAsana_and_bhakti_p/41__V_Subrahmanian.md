तस्मात् सर्वशास्त्रविदपि असंप्रदायवित् मूर्खवदेव उपेक्षणीयः says Shankara
in the Bhagavadgita Bhashya.  Whatever is not approved by the sampradaya is
not admissible to Advaitins who follow Shankara.  Outsiders' approval of
Shankara is not the criterion.  Advaitins are not worse off without the
appreciation of tantriks.
