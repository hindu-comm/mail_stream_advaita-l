The above is just one example of how poor you are when it comes to quoting
Shankara.  Shankara has Himself said: even if thousands of vedic mantras
say 'fire is cold' it should not be taken as a fact.

So what you have said here alone gets trashed and consigned to the dust
bin.

Just as you feel the Shankaravijayam is a bundle of fanciful stories so too
do I feel about your ramblings on tantra and mantra.  This list which
primarily discusses Advaita as taught by Shankara and His tradition is not
the place for the stuff you are coming up with.  Pl. keep them away from
this List and spare the members here the space and time for discussing the
true agenda of this List.
