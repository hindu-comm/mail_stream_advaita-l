Namaste Sri Sriram

I heard Nitya Karma has to be done with best possible effort.
Perfectly doing Nitya Karma is not a must. Even when there are
mistakes in Nitya Karma nothing bad will happen. Because if it is
perfectly done also nothing good will happen. But if Nitya Karma is
not done at all there will be sin.

I go home after sun set from the office. I have to give Prayascitta
arghya. Sometimes I have to go somewhere urgently and come back late.
Then also I have to give Prayascitta Arghya.
