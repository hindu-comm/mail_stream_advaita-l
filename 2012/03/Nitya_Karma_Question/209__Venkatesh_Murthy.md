Namaste

Some people say Agnihotra and Soma Yaga also are Nitya Karma for
Brahmins.  Is it correct? There is Sruti saying Yavajjivam Agnihotram
Juhoti. If a Brahmin is not Sannyasi he has to do Agnihotra till he
dies. But very very rare people are doing Agnihotra and Soma Yaga
these days. There will be Pratyavaya Dosha if Brahmins are not doing
Nitya Karma. What is the advice from Sri Bharati Tirtha Swami and
other Smarta leaders on this subject? How to avoid this Pratyavaya
sin?  Soma Yaga is very costly. Is there some other small Karma
instead of Soma Yaga in the Dharma Sastras.

Some people say Agnihotra and Soma Yaga are Nitya Karma if the Brahmin
has three Srauta Agnis like Garhapatya, Dakshinagni and Ahavaniya
otherwise no. Is it correct?
