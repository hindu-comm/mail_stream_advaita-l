Yes, for kAlAteeta dosha nivAraNa, prayaschitta arghyaM should be given 
with a saMkalpa, mama upAtta samasta duritakshayadvAra, kAlAteeta dOsha 
prAyaschittarthaM arghya pradhAnaM  karishye.  etc.  However, we should 
not make it a habit to delay the saNdhyavandana since there is a room for 
prayaschittArghya:-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
