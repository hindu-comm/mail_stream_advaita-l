Namaste Sri Sriram

The Yoga Sutra is saying about Phala. But Nitya Karma is not for any
Phala. If we don't do Nitya Karma there will be sin. If we do there is
no Phala. For Advaitis also the Nitya Karma is compulsory. Kamya
Karmas have Phala.

We cannot say instead of doing Sandhya Vandana speak Truth. Like that
we cannot say instead of Agnihotra and Soma Yaga speak Truth.
