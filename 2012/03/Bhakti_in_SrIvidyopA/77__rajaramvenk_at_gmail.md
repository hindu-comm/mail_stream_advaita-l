Sri Satish, please first define bhakti and upasana from sastras. And show why they are different. Your gurus are of least importance to anyone if their position is not based on sastras.

> You are unable to take it because it 
proves all your theories completely wrong, not only about Vedanta but 
also of mantra and bhakti >shastras, in one go.
To clarify, none of them are my theories. Some of the things that I say are from texts and the rest of them are a mix of quotes from texts coupled-with(and sometimes ratified by) experiences of different people who are into these things.

I made no theories about vedAnta, please observe from the beginning. My concern was only to highlight the difference between upAsana/various mantra shAstra traditions and between bhakti.

If you are saying, my theories about vedAnta are wrong, it shows that you are completely clueless about what was being discussed in the first place. It is up-to people to look back into the archives and see for themselves the validity of some of the things that I said.

It might also interest you to note that, the position that you hold now on this topic, is something that I also held for many years. :-)
The shift came about after meeting people and after getting exposure to info/traditions that is not usually accessible too easily.

bhakti is not some person, whom I have an enmity with. So if you are really equipped to disprove, and know enough to disprove, I have nothing to lose. Of course, as it is, you are not anywhere close to disproving anything 

Take a break. :)
