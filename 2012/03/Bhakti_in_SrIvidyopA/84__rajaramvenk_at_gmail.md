Point taken. He should express his views clearly and establish with reference to sastras.

Dear Rajaramji,

//
Your gurus are of least importance to anyone if their position is not based on sastras.

//

Personally, i am aware of satish's gurus and know them. One is the direct disciple of 
Shri Abhinava Vidya Tirtha of Sringeri and saha-adhyAyi of Brahmachari Umesh. And other is a great tAntrika belonging to shrikula sampradAya. 

So, it could be that satish is not able to express his views properly and hence a
misunderstanding. 

Pls don't indulge in making comments on the sampradya guru-parampara which is coming
down from asthAna vidwAn of sringeri mahAmahOpAdhyAya KP Shankara Shastrigal.

regs,
sriram
