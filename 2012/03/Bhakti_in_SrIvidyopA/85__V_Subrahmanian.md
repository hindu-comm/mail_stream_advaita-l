Very nice to hear this Sriram ji.  I would bet that neither the Jagadguru
mentioned above or Sri Umesh would give out the teaching the way Sri
Satish has been presenting here.  Anyone who has heard and read about the
Jagadguru, especially from the writings of Sri Umesh, which I even quoted
from yesterday, would have a lot to disagree with these posts.  And surely
someone coming in the lineage of Shri K.P.Shankara Sastry and the Sringeri
background would never ever make this most derisive caricature which I am
extremely sorry to quote here:

// To add a little flavor..if any of our "shankara is a sarvaGYa knows
everything" kind of good and kind-hearted freinds are going to say... My
 lineage is ....shankarAchArya madhyamAM..... Mwuhahaha and hold a
mAdhavIya shankara vijaya or the chaintanya charitAmR^ita or the nArada
bhakti sUtra, in the hands and say "The power of Adi shankarAchArya
compels you!!" Activate the hukU nADi or iDA instead of the kuhU nADi..
it is not going to work.   :-))//  [ from a post dt.2nd March 2012 from
Satish]
