Found this on a gaudiya vaishnava website. Its supposed to be
"SCRIPTURAL EVIDENCE" to prove shankara's philosophy was "IMAGINARY".
Comments plz :-

"Professors of philosophy in India
refer to a verse from the Padma
Purana (Uttara khanda 25.7) that
reveals the hidden identity of
Shankaracarya:
mayavadam asac-chastram
pracchannam bauddham ucyate
mayaiva vihitam devi
kalau brahmana-murtina
"The Mayavada philosophy, Siva
informed his wife Parvati, is
covered Buddhism. In the form
of a brahmana in the kali-yuga, I
teach this imagined philosophy."
Shankaracarya is thus widely
accepted as an incarnation of
Shiva.
>From a purport by: A.C.
Bhaktivedanta Swami
Prabhupada"
