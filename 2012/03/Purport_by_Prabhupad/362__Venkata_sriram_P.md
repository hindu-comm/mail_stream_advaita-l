Namaste,

Learned members like sri subbuji, sri anandji, sri vidyaji have already commented
on this issue and old posts in archives are there for study.

Questions like these would neitherhelp us in our sAdhana norour intellect gets
sharpened. These are neither *prashna* nor *pariprashna*. 

It is not these questions but regular meditation, swAdhyAya and approaching a
good achArya with humility that helps us in spiritual path. Advaita siddhAnta
has trashed aside all the philosphies that are shruti-viruddha and all the related questions
have been answered to the pUrva-pakSin. Seeking opinions from others with respect
to unrelated questions is just waste of time.
