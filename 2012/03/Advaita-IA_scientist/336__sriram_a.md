  Dears
It is really a sinking feeling that our sacred rivers are
polluted by 
industrial wastes and pure selfishness to make a few
dollars more is the 
cause.As long as money is the prime-motivator I am
afraid that such fasts 
unto death will not produce the desired
results.Even today Sri Udhaya Kumar 
announced a fast unto death to
express his anguish against nuclear wastes 
which may in the long run
cause immense damage to progeny.But who is 
listening.We are all having
the by -standers apathy only.At the most we pay 
lip service -inclusive
of myself-as we are also selfish to the 
core.R.Krishnamoorthy.
