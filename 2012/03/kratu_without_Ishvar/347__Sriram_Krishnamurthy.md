Namo Namaste,
Purva Mimamsakas also talk of  Apurva, which carries with it the merit of
the Kratu/Yajna.
According to Uttara Mimamsa(Vedanta) Badarayana cites Jaimini for the
following

B.S.(1.2.28), Bādarāyana quotes Jaimini as saying that "There is no
contradiction in taking Vaishvānara as the supreme Brahman".

B.S(1.2.31), Jaimini is again cited by Bādarāyana as saying that the
Nirguna  Brahman can manifest itself as having a form.

B.S(4.3.12), Bādarāyana again explains Jaimini as saying that the Mukta
Purusha attains Brahman.

Sri Sadguru Charanaravindabhyam Namaha,

Sriram
