Namaste,

Acharya Pushpadanta refutes the theory that effect is independant of theoretical 
constructs.

He uses very carefully the word *kratau suptE* in the 20th sloka. 

The dakSa yajna was meticulous supervised by all the mantravAdins, devatas and 
above all viSNu. The prayOga, vidhi & viniyOga was perfectly implemented here.
Then why the dakSa yajna got destroyed.

The purpose of using the word *kratau suptE* is to show that if one ignores 
the karma phala dAta, howsoever grandly one performs the karma kANDa, 
it is just a dormant, lifeless, dead ritual without any chaitanya in it. 

The kratu is dormant and in *sleep mode* (kratau suptE) whereas Ishwara who is
karma phala pradAta is always *awake* in bestowing the fruits of that kratu. 

If one forgets the Ishwara by ignoring / lacking shraddha on Him, the yajamana has
to face the consequences like dakSa whose yajna got destroyed. The subsequent
sloka ie., 21st one was beautifully explained by Acharya Pushpadanta. 

regs,
sriram
