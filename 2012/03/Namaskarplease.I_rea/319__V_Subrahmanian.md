This verse has been analysed in detail and shown to be spurious.  The
accusation it supposedly makes of Advaita has been proven to be without any
basis.  For example it says: In advaita alone one is asked to give up all
karma-s.  I have shown, on the basis of Shankara bhashya, that such is not
the case.    Pl. dig up the archives of this forum for detailed notes.
