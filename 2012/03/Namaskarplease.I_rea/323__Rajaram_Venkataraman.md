If you are really asking me for the basis, I can provide you that. Or you
can find it yourself by studying the research  in to Kalamukha and Kapalika
sects of pasupatha matham. Or specifically look for Lakulisa or Nakulisa.
If you are saying that it is my inability to grasp their matham, your
question to me on the basis of my statements is  unnecessary because you
already have a conclusion. Anyway, I would agree because they had secret
codes not passed to outsiders :)


//ISKCON devotees are very committed to Krishna Bhakti. They have Lord

haunted by a president of ISKCON branch(a popular one !!).  He was after me
for initiation of kriShNa mantra and almost pestered me.  When i asked what
should be my qualification for initation of that mantra, he asked meto just
pay Rs. 1000/- to him which is the only qualification ! There are also
other clandestine affairs that go on in someof the branches but i am
tight-lipped on that issue lestthe discussion gets side tracked.

I disagree with their philosophical conclusions but know that they have
organisational mechanisms in place to weed out bad elements. It is clearly
against their principles. Instead of being tight lipped about adharma and
gossiping about it, you should write to their management for corrective
action.

They have well defined process for diksha and what you say is impossible.
Also, they have very good cash flow in place and 1000 Rs. is not  a big
money at all for them. In Mayapur, they are doing a temple town project for
800 crores. In Chennai, they just completed a temple project for 10 cores.
There are at least 10 such initiatives in India alone.
