You are right. The Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Hare Krishna
Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare mantra specified in Kalisantarana
Upanishad is set in anushtup chandas (32).  However, the Hare Krishna Hare
Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare
mantra, which occurs in Radha Tantra is set in gayatri chandas (24). From
Radha Tantra: gāyatrī chanda ity uktaṃ tripurā devatā matā. Before the last
eight syllables, it introduces a visargam. Once you chant the mantra three
times, these three combine to form 24 matras.

visargaṃ tu sutaśreṣṭha sākṣāt kuṇḍalinī parā/
rāma rāmeti ca padaṃ śivaśaktiḥ svayaṃ suta/
hare harepi ca padaṃ śaktidvayasamanvitaṃ//44//

The meaning of this mantra is very different from the one in kalisantarana.
