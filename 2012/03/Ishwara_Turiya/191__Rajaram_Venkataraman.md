I am aware of Dhanapati Suri - will come to that later. He is later in date
to Madhusudana. That is why I asked you to cite an Advaita acharya before
Madhusudana who holds the view that Ishwara's form is panchabautika.
Paramaya and Ishwara should be called unreal.

I meant to say instead negating Virata, Hiranyagarbha and Avyakta, you are
negating Ishwara. Once you have accepted Him as the Self, how can you
negate Him unless you become a Buddhist?
