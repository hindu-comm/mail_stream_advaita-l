The 4 states of consciousness are :
Jaagrath Avasthaa – Wakeful State,
Swapna Avastha – Dream State,
Sooptha Avastha – Deep Sleep State,
Thuriya Avastha  - 4th State, In this 4th state, the body
consciousness goes and only the “I” ness remains.
There is one more state called Thiruyaatheetha Avastha  as per Raaja
YOga, where there is total Blackout. This state is not mentioned in
Maandukya Upanishadh.
Yes, Mandukya Upanishadh describes the 4th State Thiruya Avastha in detail :
Esha sarveshvara – It is the eashwra for all,
Esha sarvagnya – it is omniscient,
Esha antharyaam – it exists inside everything,
Esha yOnihi – it is the cause of creation,
Sarvasya prabhava abhyahouhi bhoothaanaam – is responsible for
creation and destruction of all,
Na antha pragyam – no inner consciousness,
Na bahi pragyam – no outer consciousness,
Na ubayathaha pragyam – no inner and outer consciousness together,
Na pragyanaganam – not both the consciousnesses bundled into one,
Na pragyam – no consciousness,
Na apragyam – no unconsciousness,
Adrushtam – unseen,
Avyavahaaryam – undescribable,
Agraahyam – non understandable,
alakshaNam – without characteristics,
achinthyam – non thinkable,
avyapadeshyam – in explicable,
Eka aathma prathyaya saaram – The aathman is only one,
Prapancha upashamam – also beyond the Universe, (or beyond the creation),
Shaantham – Peaceful,
Shivam – Benevolent,
Adhvaitham – Non Dual,
Chathurtham -  4th State,
Sa aathmaa sa vigyEyaha – thus should the aathman be known.
Being a Raaja YOga practicer, I have gone through all these 5 states
of consciousness, and as per RamaNa Maharishi and Nisargadatta
Maharaj, the Brahman is normally in 5th State, Thuriyaatheetha Avastha
and comes to Thuriya avastha when required, since Thuriya avastha –
the “I” ness is required for creation.
