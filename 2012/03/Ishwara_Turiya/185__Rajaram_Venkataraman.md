It is very good and incisive post from Sri Subrahmanian as usual though I
disagree with the conclusions - reasons inset.

When we consider Ishwara to be distinct from the Innermost Self, we
consider Him to be an external agent who gives results to us in this world
or the other. This is negated as unreal, a mere imagination. But Ishwara,
the Self, cannot be negated. There is no change in the consciousness of
Ishwara, neither is His knowledge tinged with avidya. So, prajnam brahma
applies to Ishwara.

Eternality associated with the cycle of samsara caused by avidya or apara
maya is changeful. But no change can be predicated on the eternality of
Ishwara or Brahman. (It is important to note that Sankara refers to both
Brahman and Maya as kutastham).

Maya does not limit Ishwara or cast Him in to the three states. We cannot
have two stands - either He is Turiya or He is in illusion. That He is
beyond illusion is well known through sastras and bhashya.

I am sorry for Him. I see why the adage dharitra narayanan used by
Vivekananda fits Him :) Sankara starts the Gita with a clear definition of
Narayana, Avyakta, created beings such as Hiranyagarbha. The world,
sentient and insentient, come from avyakta, a mass of consciousness. But
Narayana, known as the supreme deity in the sastras, is transcendent to
avyakta. What is negated is everything Vyasa and avyakta, not Ishwara.

As you know, Saguna Brahman does not create the world like a potter creates
a pot with clay. He is not connected with the world (na matsthani sarva
bhutani pasyame yogaisvaram) though from vyavahara perspective, we say
every thing is pervaded by Him and rests on Him etc. The criteria for
mithyatva is ultimate unreality. There is no sruti basis to to say Ishwara,
known as the Self, is unreal. Regarding His form, it is very clear that He
does not have a material form. In fact, He never changes His nature as One
transcendent to all  forms. His para maya, non-different from Him,
manifests the forms in the mind of the devotees and demons.

I promised to complete my article on apaureshyatvam, which I am not able to
yet due to certain challenges. Once I complete, I will talk to him. He also
said he will research in to Bhakti rasa in early Advaita. I have no doubt
in your intelligence or honesty. So, there is no difference between you or
me asking.

It does make other of them mithya but only duality attributed due to
ignorance.
