So, your position is that there are only four states, no fifth as stated in Sri Subramanian's mail. Also Ishwara is not turiya as stated by Sri Devanathan. Did I understand you right?

> Yes, Mandukya Upanishadh describes the 4th State Thiruya Avastha in detail :
> Esha sarveshvara – It is the eashwra for all,
> Esha sarvagnya – it is omniscient,
> Esha antharyaam – it exists inside everything,
> Esha yOnihi – it is the cause of creation,
> Sarvasya prabhava abhyahouhi bhoothaanaam – is responsible for
> creation and destruction of all,
> Na antha pragyam – no inner consciousness,
> Na bahi pragyam – no outer consciousness,
> Na ubayathaha pragyam – no inner and outer consciousness together,

esha sarveSvara esha sarvajna esho'ntAryAmy esha yonis sarvasya
prabhavApyayau hi bhUtAnAm - this is a description of prAjna in the
sushupta state. This is not to be applied to the turIya state in the text
of the mANDUkya upanishat.

The next sentence, beginning with nAntaH prajnan na bahishprajnaM,
is the description of the turIya state. Note that the upanishat itself
only uses the word caturtha. The term turIya is used in the kArikA of
gauDapAdAcArya. If you read the upanishat along with the kArikA,
you will find that the first nine verses of the kArikA are traditionally
found in between the sentence ending with prabhavApyayau hi
bhUtAnAm and the sentence beginning with nAntaH prajnam. The
next nine verses of the kArikA, where the term turIya is found for the
first time, occur after the sentence that describes the caturtha state.
Note also that turIya in the kArikA is nothing more than a synonym of
caturtha in the upanishat.
