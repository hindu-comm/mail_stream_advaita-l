As far as I see, BG 8.18 refers to the states of Avyakta and Hiranyagarbha,
not Ishwara, who is beyond these states.

I am referring to the following:
"Mandukya Upanishad Verse VII:

VII: Turiya is not that which is conscious of the inner (subjective) world,
nor that which is conscious of the outer (objective) world, nor that which
is conscious of both, nor that which is a mass of consciousness. It is not
simple consciousness nor is It unconsciousness. It is unperceived,
unrelated, incomprehensible, uninferable, unthinkable and indescribable.
The essence of the Consciousness manifesting as the self in the three
states, It is the cessation of all phenomena; It is all peace, all bliss
and non—dual. This is what is known as the Fourth (Turiya). This is Atman
and this has to be realized.


10 Turiya, the changeless Ruler, is capable of destroying all miseries. All
other entities being unreal, the non—dual Turiya alone is known as
effulgent and all—pervading."

A person is lazy and unclean. We say he is tamasic. The adjectives, lazy
and unclean are viseshas. The generalised cause tamas is guna. For samsara
and panchabautika loka, trigunatmika apara maya is the cause. For viseshas
such as Rama, Krishna, Linga etc., Paramaya, non-different from Ishwara,is
the cause. I am not referring to the panchabautika bimbo created by us of
Rama, Krishna etc., but to His avirbhava manifestation by His sankalpa.
