He asserted that Ishwara is turiya

//

He might not have given such hasty statements. But, let us know under which context he asserted it. Because, just a blunt statement that "ishwara is turiya" would not make
any sense as we don't know what was the conversion that went offoffline. I am sure he is being quoted out of context.

Acharya Pushpadanta in "Siva Mahimnah Stavah" extolls Siva and says that "turIyaM tE dhAmaM......".
