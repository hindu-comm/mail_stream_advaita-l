The above is quite true.  Yet, like the term "Ishwara' this term 'state'
with reference to the Turiya found across texts could give one an
impression that it too is a state:

The Panchadashi 6th chapter called 'Chitra deepam' begins with the
following verse:

*यथा चित्रपटे* दृष्टम् अवस्थानां चतुष्टयम् ।
परमात्मनि विज्ञेयं तथा अवस्थाचतुष्टयम् ॥१॥

[Just as one can see four 'stages' in (the making of) a painting on a
canvas, so  too one has to understand four states in the ParamAtman.]

The chapter goes on to brilliantly draw more correspondences between the
canvas-painting and ParamAtman/Brahman.  It is a treat to read this
chapter. In fact one can say this chapter is a treatise on the Mandukya
Upanishad.

Shankara too uses the term 'avasthA' with reference to the Supreme, for
example, in the  most recently cited BSB 2.1.14:

एवं *परमार्थावस्थायां *सर्वव्यवहाराभावं वदन्ति वेदान्ताः सर्वे   ।

While the pAramArthika is not really a state, yet in relation to the
vyAvahArika, it is figuratively termed one, just to show the contrast even
while retaining the 'figurative' nature of the term with reference to the
Supreme.
