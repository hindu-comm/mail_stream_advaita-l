By what will be negate Saguna Brahman, who is nirupadhika by definition?"

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Definitely we cannot negate saguNa brahman who does not have any upAdhi!! 
but advaita says nirupAdhika brahman is NOT saguNa, it is nirguNa only. 
And sOpAdhika brahman is saguNa brahman.  So, nobody can negate the 
existence of saguNa and nirupAdhikatva of the brahman since it is NOT a 
valid & answerable question.  Since question itself is contradictory. 
sOpAdhika, saguNa brahma is meant for prAptavyaM and nirupAdhika, nirguNa 
brahma is for jnAtvyaM.  paraM chet jnAtavyaM aparaM chet prAptavyaM, 
clarifies shankara somewhere. And this jneya brahma is nirupAdhika only 
and this is the upanishad pratipAdita 'main' brahma clarifies sUtra 
arUpavadeva hi tat pradhAnatvAt. Shruti tirelessly advocates the nirguNa 
brahman in somany terms like akAyaM, avraNam, asnAviraM, achakshushrotraM, 
tadapANipAdam, apraNaM, amukhaM etc. etc. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
