Please read one of your earlier posts where  you argued that Ishwara's form
is panchabautika or material on the grounds that if it is not then it has
to be Brahman because there is no third entity apart from matter and spirit
but it cannot be because the latter is beyond all names and forms. We have
to take a clear position on the nature of Ishwara as beyond Virat,
Hiranyagarbha and Avyakta. Then we have to equate Ishwara to Paramaya. Then
comes the acceptance of the particular manifestations such as Rama and
Krishna as Para Mayika, non-different from Him, the Self. Madhusudana
criticises those who ascribe difference between Ishwara and His form as
illogical. The changeless Ishwara, transcendent to names and forms, does
not create a form material or otherwise. By His Paramaya, He reveals the
bliss of Brahman by manifesting these forms in the minds of devotees.

Yes, rightfully so because they are not two different entities.

We cannot say His form is pramayika or pure consciousness and in the same
breadth say it is changeful. Ishwara did not undergo change as that is he
nature of matter not Paramaya. He manifested different forms and qualities
in our mind, which is within spacious-temporal realm, through His
changeless Paramaya. By this He made the impossible, namely the conception
of the bliss of Brahman, possible.
