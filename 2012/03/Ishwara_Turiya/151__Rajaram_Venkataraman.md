As far as I can see, it only describes Turiya. In fact, Gaudapada
specifically non-negates Ishwara in his karika by saying, "Turiya, the
changeless Ruler, is capable of destroying all miseries".

I had posed two specific questions that challenge the position Ishwara is
not Turiya. One, why would Sankara, expert with words and a great teacher,
say explicitly is BSB that "Ishwara is Turiya". Two, what is the state of
Ishwara, who is beyond Hiranyagarbha? As He is without mind, He can't be in
deep sleep, dreaming or wakeful states.
