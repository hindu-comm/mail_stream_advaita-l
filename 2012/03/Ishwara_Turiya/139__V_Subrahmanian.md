Just for those who might be interested, here is a video clipping of a talk
by the Kanchi Mahaperiyava (Sri Chandrashekharendra Saraswati SwaminaH)
where the 'form/body' of Ishwara/Avatara is stated as 'panchabhautikam'.

The speech is in Tamil.

The logic used is perfectly in tune with the Advaitic method: If something
is experienced, seen, in colour, form and as being possessed of hands,
legs, etc. then it must be physical, bhautikam.  The Mahabharata verse
(which is cited by Shankara in the BSB and Madhusudana in BG 4.6) : माया
ह्येषा मया सृष्टा यन्मां पश्यसि नारद । सर्वभूतगुणैर्युक्तं नैवं मां
ज्ञातुमर्हसि is cited in the video in support of the above conclusion.  The
Lord says: Narada, what you see before you, that Me, aught not to be known
to be really this bhautika body.  The talk also proves the thinking 'the
Lord and His form are non-different' wrong.  For, the Lord Himself says
that His form that is being seen (by Narada) is not really Him.

It is also in perfect tune with Shankara's commentaries that hold: a form
is an aid to express our devotion, etc. to the Brahman that is really
formless.
