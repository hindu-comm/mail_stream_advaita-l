If you were the one teaching Sastrigal, then why ask me to talk to him?
Your views are directly opposed to the views of Madhusudana, Sridhara etc.
if you say that Ishwara's body is panchabautika. I have quoted them to say
that it is not. You should quote at least one Advaita acharya before
Madhusudana for your position that Ishwara's body is made of five elements.
Otherwise, your view has nothing to do with Advaita tradition whatever
proximity you may claim.

As I stated, you have confused between Virata, Hiranyagarbha, Avyakta and
Ishwara. You are negating Ishwara whereas Mandukya only asks you to negate
Ishwara.
