I agree; my point was that if we take the mANDUkya's usage of
turIya/chaturtha as standard advaita-vedAnta terminology, then a fifth
"turIyAtIta" is meaningless (and also Ishvara is not turIya). The
expression turIyAtIta is not generally used in the advaita-vedAnta
saMpradAya.  On the contrary, it is common to come across
advaita-vedAnta students getting misled or confused by the term
"turIyAtIta" as if it meant a state "beyond" the turIya of the
mANDUkya.
