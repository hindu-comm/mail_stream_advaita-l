I was discussing with Sri Devanathan yesterday. He asserted that Ishwara is turiya. How can two scholars trained in the same school and even mutt differ on a basic point? It baffles me.

Rajaram, we have gone over this several times:  Ishwara is not turiya; He
comes in the state just prior to Turiya in the Mandukya Upanishad.  See the
sixth mantra and the bhashya from any Advaitic publication.
