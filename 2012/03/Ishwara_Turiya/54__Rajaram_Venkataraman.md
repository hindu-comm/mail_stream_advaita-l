Can you define it and differentiate it from Turiya?
It is supposed to have been used by twelfth century advaitins to define the
state of Brahman. The problem with Turiya was polemical attack from
dualists that it is the fourth and hence dependent on the the three! Sri
Devanathan says it has upanishadic reference. He works hard and is trained
as a scholar - SI understands the importance of textual reference

me any references to that effect? I do not understand what you mean by
being "in Turiya"?
It was used by Sri Vidyasankar. Turiya is what is used by Gaudapada and
Sankara. But turiyAvatha is figuratively right. It is the akhandakara vrtti
of a jnani.

Yes. The lamp lights even after the drama is over. Sakshi is not dependent
on witnessed objects for its existence.

He is suddha, buddha, nitya, mukta. He is sarvajna in the sense of making
everything known.

vyavaharika or
On this later - got to catch train. Read Sankara bhashya introduction and
Anandagiri
