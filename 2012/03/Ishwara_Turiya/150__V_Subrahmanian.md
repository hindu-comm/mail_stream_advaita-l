Maya, Ishwara and jiva and samsara, avidya and the connection between
avidya and Chit  are all admitted as anAdi in Advaita.  So all your above
questions/observations will find answers/solutions in the anAdi-context.
And as I pointed out earlier all these remain, continue for ever for
samsaris and for Jnani's the entire hexad is realized to be mithyA.   Since
TuriyA is something that has no connection with any of these six, even
Ishwara who is within this hexad, does not come to be recognized as
Turiya.  'prapanchopashamam' of the seventh mantra of the Mandukya is one
word that is enough to negate all the six from Turiya.
