Gaudapada defines Turiya as the changeless ruler. Sankara says Isvara is
Turiya in BSB. Anyway, there is no room for illusory states such as
jagratha, svapna and susupti in the case of Ishwara. You are confusing
avyakta and Hiranyagarbha states with Ishwara.

One can say anything one wants but my moha and soka will not go away by
such assertions. From a vyavahara perspective, there is a reality of
samsara, which has to be destroyed by knowing Him, the Self. It cannot be
achieved by reducing Vishnu, the self-effulgence Rudra, to the illusory
states. It can only be achieved through atma nivedhanam - then here is no
Rajaram, only Atmaram!

I have responded to that. Samashti prajna is Avyakta, the sleeping state of
Hiranyagarbha. It is not Narayana, that Sankara describes as Avyakto paro
in line with hundreds of sruti and smriti statements.

How about adjectives such as follower of Sankara,Sureshwara, Madhusudana
etc.? They say that. It is incorrect to say that Maya limits Ishwara.
Instead of arguing with me and assuming your position is right, why don't
you talk to Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal or Sri Krishnamurthy Sastrigal. Tell
them that a new kid on the block says Advaita tradition has used
nirupadhika with respect to Saguna Brahman and see what they say. Trust me
- I do my home work :)
