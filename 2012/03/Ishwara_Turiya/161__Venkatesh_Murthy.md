Namaste

If Ishwara is in Turiya he has to be Ishwara of something or someone.
What is that? If there is something or someone like a Bhakta in Turiya
and Ishwara is ruling it there is no Advaita but Dvaita. There is a
ruler and there is a ruled thing.

 In Vyavahara he is ruling the world. But in Turiya there is no world.
What is he ruling? If he is not ruling anything you can call him as
Ishwara or anything. It is a name only without meaning. But if you are
calling Brahman as Ishwara there is no problem.
