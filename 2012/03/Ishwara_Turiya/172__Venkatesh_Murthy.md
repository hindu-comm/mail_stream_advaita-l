Namaste

If you say Ishwara has no name and form argument here is only about
what we have to call this thing. There is something outside name and
form. You are saying it is Ishwara but others are saying Nirguna
Brahma. You are saying the same thing. They are saying same thing.

If you are saying Ishwara can manifest names and forms it is only
Vyavaharika to help Upasakas. But he  is not really doing that.
Because in Turiya there is no Upasaka  or Upasya Devata or Upasana. Or
you can say they have become ONE.
