The last sentence had a typo "We cannot negate Hiranyagabha to a blade of
grass, product of avidya, using jnana. By what will be negate Saguna
Brahman, who is nirupadhika by definition?". It shoul read as ""We can
negate Hiranyagabha to a blade of grass, product of avidya, using jnana. By
what will be negate Saguna Brahman, who is nirupadhika by definition?"

Sankara says so in his commentary to BG 7.6! Does Saguna Brahman have
non-Consciousness aspect to Him? I dont think so because He does not have a
body or mind. As you know, He is beyond Hiranyagarbha and Virata.

Ishwara occupy this form like a jiva occupies karma generated body? If an
advaitin answers yes to this, he will be directly contradicting Sridhara
Swami and Madhusudana.Unless he finds support in the writings of any one
advaita acharya before them, he will stand outside the tradition. My search
so far hasyielded no direct textual support to say that Ishwara's form is
pancha-bautika produced through a non-pancha-bautikaprocess. I think we
have to be extremely careful in quoting Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal on this
because Sri Devanathan, who studied under him for years, has a
different understanding that contradicts yours. Anyway, does Sri Mani
Dravid Sastrigal differentiate betweenVishnu and Para Maya? Krishna Himself
says His Para Maya is of the nature of the Self (Consciousness).  Or does
he say Vishnu is acit? :) We cannot say that the form is paramayika and in
the same breadth say it is from Him. If we say that Ishwara, the Self of
all, Sakshi, is mithya, then it is NirIshwara Advaita.

define Turiya. Also, just because tarati shokam atmavit does not sayt that
that it is possible to become an atma vit without the grace of Ishwara or
that Ishwara is anAtma. The Lord, the innermost Self, is well known to be a
swift reliever from the ocean of misery from the Gita. Also, it is said
that by knowing Him one crosses the ocean of misery. So, Isha, the Lord,
the innermost Self of all, is referred to in this verse. So, after negation
of everything He remains. We cannot negate Hiranyagabha to a blade of
grass, product of avidya, using jnana. By what will be negate Saguna
Brahman, who is nirupadhika by definition?
