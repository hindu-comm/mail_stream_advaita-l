Even here you fail to see the difference.  It is Pure Consciousness that is
NirguNa Brahman that comes to 'somehow' associate with prakRti to engage in
creation. And saguNa Brahman is nothing but this Pure Consciousness plus
the upAdhi of creator, etc.

This kind of oneness is impossible in Advaita.

>From the type of questions you come up with despite answers being provided
with the authority of the tradition/scripture, it is evident that you fail
to grasp the fundamentals.  Take for example the last question above: Where
is it said that SaguNa Brahman is nirupAdhika by definition?  Who has
defined it so?  The very concept of saguNa Brahman arises in Advaita ONLY
because it is sopAdhika.  Only the upAdhi makes it so.   And you say: //We
cannot negate Hiranyagabha to a blade of
grass, product of avidya, using jnana.//  Actually this is the very
objective of Advaita jnanam.  It is aimed at negating the entire created
universe both at the cosmic and the individual levels.  And regarding your
opinion about the Gaudapada karika it is enough for me to say this:  Only
those who have experience in studying a variety of Shankara's bhashya-s
will be able to discern where there is a description of nirguNa brahman and
where there is not.  And such a study will reveal, out of experience to
him, what shruti/smriti passages Shankara quotes for nirguNa brahman and
what for the other.  'Tarati shokam Atmavit' is a standard shruti passage
in Advaita to indicate the knowledge of nirguna brahman.

I would once again appeal to students of Advaita to either attend a class
by a renowned Acharya or start listening, on a daily basis, just like being
in a class, to the recorded lectures/classes of Swami Paramarthananda on
the Mandukya Upanishad.  It will clarify a lot of things.
