That might have been before I spoke to Dr.Sastrigal about this.  Still the
body of Ishwara is matter alone.  For Ishwara Himself takes it, remains in
it and leaves it at will.  It is 'this', 'idam' for Him too.  It is only
because Arjuna identified Krishna, Bhagavan, with His body, did he wail
inconsolably when Krishna'a avatAra sharIra had disappeared from this
world.  Surely Brahman can never appear and disappear, being all pervading
and ever existing.  That is why do we have a date for His janma, a navami
or ashtami.  That is the stand of Advaita with regard to any body.

All this does not have a valid Advaitic argument.

True the 'entity' is one only but we cannot mix sopAdhika and nirupAdhika
and interchange them at our whims.  That is the reason Shankara makes the
two separate and maintains the distinction at every instance.  As Bhaskar
ji pointed out, the sopAdhika Brahman is upAsya and leads to Brahmaloka.
The nirupAdhika Brahman is jneya, to be realized, and leads to instant
liberation.

This is exactly called 'aghaTita ghaTanA paTiyasI mAyA', making the
impossible possible.  See how you are getting into tighter and tighter
knots on this issue. You are not able to, with certainty, say whether the
body of Ishwara is Chaitanya or mAyika or bhautika  because you are unable
to overlook the changes/transformations this body underwent.  To say that
He introduced these manifestations in 'our mind' is nothing but dRSthi
srishti vAda where everything is one's own kalpana. Surely the dualistic
schools would not accept this.  Several people saw and interacted with that
body at that time. In order to introduce into Advaita the Vaishnava
concepts of avatara, paramaya, etc. which might have validity in their
schools which have different meanings for Pure Consciousness, you are
laboring so hard.  Advaita is very clear with its two-fold distinction: dRk
and dRshya.  The Consciousness that is everyone including Ishwara/Brahman
can never be dRshya, seen; it is ever the dRk, the seer, illuminer,
witness.  The dRshya, the illumined, seen, objectified, is never the dRk.
Surely the forms of Ishwara come under the dRshya category alone.  And in
Advaita whatever is dRk is jaDa, anAtmA.  Advaita is never at any loss
without these Vaishnava concepts on this matter. To force it on Advaita is
what is regrettable and avoidable.  The Kenopanishat explicitly denies
Brahman-status to the body of Ishwara which is upAsya, dRshya: nedam
yadidam upAsate.  It is only for the purpose of aiding the sadhana of those
who are unable to recognize the dRk does the scripture talk about/assigns a
form to Brahman.  Shankara says in the BSB: syAt parameshwarasyApi
icchAvashAt mAyAmayam sharIram sAdhakAnugrahArtham.
