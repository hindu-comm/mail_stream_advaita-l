No one has objected to the fact that Ishwara is in TuriyAvasthA just as a
Jnani is and even as everyone in ignorance is. The only difference is that
the ignorant ones think that the three states are real for them whereas the
Jnani knows they are not for the Self but only for the mind.  The question
that Ishwara is the subject matter of the seven mantra of the Mandukya is
what is objectionable, if anyone holds such a view.

This is not correct.  According to Vedanta and even according to the Gita
without the Consciousness aspect contributing Itself along with mAyA the
transforming entity there is no creation possible.  मयाध्यक्षेण प्रकृतिः
सूयते सचराचरम् .  With Me as the Seer, Superintendent, Consciousness,
prakRti brings forth the world of sentient and insentient beings (moving
and unmoving).  So the Consciousness aspect is NirguNa Chaitanyam here.

This view is not admitted by Advaita.  As I have clarified earlier several
times, on the basis of Dr.Mani Dravid Sastrigal's explanation, based again
on the Advaita siddhi and the Laghu chandrika, the aprAkRta is well within
mAyA/prakRti.  The only difference between the other bodies and Bhagavan's
is that the former is a product of panchabhautika transformation and the
latter is a product that bypasses this step but stems straightaway from
Maya.  For this reason it no way becomes the same as Brahman.

We have to carefully note that NarayaNa's jagatkAraNatvam, etc. stems from
the existence of jagat.  All these attributes of Brahman are undoubtedly
dependent on the jagat / jiva combine.  When through the Advaitic
realization the jagat and jiva are negated as mithyA the entire
attribute-oriented Ishwara too gets negated, for such a one has no role
whatsoever any longer.  The very mAyAshabalitatvam stems because of mAyA.
When mAyA is known to be naught, there is a negation of everything that
depended upon this mAyA.

It has been already explained that Ishwara, as Brahmavit, is Turiya.

This verse has been commented upon from the nirguNabrahman angle,
completely, by Shankara and Anandagiri. Shankara comments 'IshAnaH' is
explained by Gaudapaada Himself in this verse as 'prabhuH', Lord.  For what
is He the Lord? For duHkha nivRtti.  'Tarati shokam Atmavit' says the
Shruti.  The knower of the Self goes above misery.  So this verse does not
talk about the saguNa brahman (Ishwara).
