Rajaram: Does Sankara say gunas are imagined or only the viseshas? I dont
think he says that Maya is an imaginary entity but due to the effect of
Maya, we imagine differences and attributes to Brahman. My understanding is
that Brahman and Ishwara are one only though I agree that some of Ishwara's
lakshanas are svarupa and others are tatastha.

Rajaram: If your position is correct that "gunas" should be rid of for
liberation, then Ishwara cannot by definition get liberated because He is
by definition saguna. But Sankara defines Him as transcendent. My
understanding is that it is not paramaya, that is non-different from
Ishwara, that should be rid of. It is one with Ishwara. Paingala Upanishad
says that it is non-different from Brahman. What needs to be rid of is
apara maya and its effects that apparently buinds the jiva.

Rajaram: Is there a difference between Vishnu and His state?

Rajaram: My understanding is that deep sleep is closest to the state of
Brahman (hence sarvesvara etc.) but there is ignorance, which impels
re-emergence. But in turiya, there is no ignorance. I see how beings upto
Hiranyagarbha (sarveshvara etc.) can be in deep sleep but not Ishwara who
is beyond Hiranyagarbha.

Rajaram: Does Ishwara change state? I dont see how one who is avayaya
change.
