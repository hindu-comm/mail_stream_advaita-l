Hari OM~
Sri Rajaram,

I think you should go over the writing closely to critically understand my
argument. I would gloss it for you if you want.

Except for the two references - one to Brahma-siddhi paksa and a passing
reference to Bhamati, the rest of my exposition is purely with reference
and emphasis only to explain BhagavatpAda's position on Ishvara.

Further with regard to this issue there is no prakriyA bheda at all.

With Narayana Smrti,
