///

and as per RamaNa Maharishi and Nisargadatta
Maharaj, the Brahman is normally in 5th State, Thuriyaatheetha Avastha
and comes to Thuriya avastha when required, since Thuriya avastha –
the “I” ness is required for creation.

//

As per Vedanta, there are only 4. There is no 5th one. 

Only the shAktAs believe in the 5th one.
