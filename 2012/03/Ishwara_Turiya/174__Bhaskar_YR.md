It is Hiranyagarbha that is called apara Brahman, which is to be negated
through jnana.

No, it is Ishwara only negated by shankara in 2-1-14 by using the exact 
word 'Ishwara'.  His words are : The brahman conditioned by name and form 
set up by avidyA becomes Ishwara, just as universal ether limited as it 
were by jars, pots etc. Here in this bhAshya itself, shankara negates 
Ishwara's omniscience and omnipotence and clarifies these qualities holds 
water only in vyAvahArika realm.  I dont think anywhere shankara talks 
about saguNa brahman who is beyond names and forms (nirupAdhika). And the 
sUtra bhAshya which I quoted earlier is from 4-3-14.  Kindly refer these 
two bhAshya vAkya-s and clarify why shankara explicitly saying here 
Ishwara/saguNa brahman is avidyAtmaka & kevala vyavahArika.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
