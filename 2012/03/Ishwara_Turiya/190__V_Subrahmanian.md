I would like to bring to the notice of the followers of this thread that
though the discussion of 'what constitutes the body of Ishwara as avatara'
is not connected to this thread, it has come up incidentally.  Readers who
are interested to know what positions other Advaita Acharyas hold on this
matter may read the commentaries of Dhanapati Suri ('bhAShyotkarShdeepikA')
who has criticised Madhusudana's views on BG 4.6 by showing how it stands
opposed to Shankara's commentary.  I would like to stop with this on this
rather unimportant topic in Advaita.  It is sufficient to know that
whatever view an Advaita Acharya has taken, in Advaita it is anAtmA.  It is
dRshya.  It is mAyika.  Therefore unreal.

I am unable to make out anything from the above.  I find Dhanapati Suri's
explanation too clearly marking that Ishwara's body/form  is not Brahman.
And since I have already made known to the LIst what Dr. Sastrigal has said
about apraAkRta I find no need to approach him again on this.  He has
clarified this point to the extent it is sufficient for me to grasp it.  In
effect it is: prAkRtam and aprAkRtam are both 'avAntarabheda-s' within
prakRti alone.
