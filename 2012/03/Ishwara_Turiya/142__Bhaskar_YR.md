He might not have given such hasty statements.  But, let us know under 
which context he asserted it.  Because, just a blunt statement that 
"ishwara is turiya" would not make
any sense as we don't know what was the conversion that went off offline. 
I am sure he is being quoted out of context. 

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Perhaps. what Sri Rajaram prabhuji saying is correct.  Sri Devanathan 
(antaryAmi) prabhuji holds the view that Ishwara is eternal not mere 
vyAvahArika satya.  In one of his posts he argued this point.  I think, 
bhAmati school holds this view point.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
