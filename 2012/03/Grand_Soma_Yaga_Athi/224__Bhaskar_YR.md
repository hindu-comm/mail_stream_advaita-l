Then the chantings were in the normal style.  Thus I found,
even within Karnataka, two styles existing: one Gokarna and the other with
no Maharashtra influence.

Yes, I too have observed this.  Kanchi pAtha  is quite different from 
Mysore pAtha.  I heard these two types of chanting when I attended 
pavamAna hOma.  In kanchi pAtha 'svarita' svara to the hrasvAkshara will 
be recited as if it is 'deerghAkshara'.  For example, the word 
'svAdhishtaya' in pavamAna will be recited like 'svadheeshtaya' ('dhee' 
instead of dhi) since the 'dhi' akshara has the 'svarita' (udAtta).  But 
in Mysore pAtha it is normal chanting.  Challakere brothers chanting and 
Rigveda ghanapAti-s Sri Krishna Bhatt & Addagadde Krishna Murthy etc. 
would follow this method only. 

Hari Hari Hari Boll!!!
