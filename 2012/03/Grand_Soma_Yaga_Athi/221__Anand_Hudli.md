Actually, I find the way the Veda (I have heard only the Rigveda) is
recited by Namboodiris is quite different from what I am used to. An
AptoryAma soma yAga was held in Bangalore in 2007. This one had Ritvijas
mostly from GokarNa. The hotA was Shri Ganesh Joglekar, if I am not
mistaken. It was quite an experience to hear the calls of "vaShaT
(vauShaT)", while making an offering in the sacrifice, as opposed to
"svAhA" in a Homa. A DVD of the event was also produced. Please contact:
Om Shantidhama, #3371, 13th Cross, K.R. Road, 2nd Main, Shastrinagar,
Bangalore 560 028. Phone: +91 80 2676 1057.

Another organization, Vaidika Samshodhana Mandal, based in Pune, has
produced an informative set of VCDs on the PurnamAseShTi (full moon
sacrifice), with a good English commentary by Dr. T. N. Dharmadhikari.
However, if I remember correctly, the ritual is by kANva-shAkhA shukla
yajurvedins, and pronounciation of mantras is not all that great. The step
by step commentary is good. The same organization has also produced a video
commentary on a vAjapeya sacrifice held sometime in the 1950s in Pune. In
this case, the various steps in the Yajna are depicted, but the mantras are
not audible. The contact details are: Vaidika Samshodhana Mandala, TMV
Colony, Mukundnagar, Pune, 411 037, Phone: +91 20 2426 2635.
