Namaste,

There are good hotels in Bhadrachalam itself and choose the good one by 
seeing the hotel ratings.You can also plan to visit the Rama temple
of bhadrachalam which was constructed by a great devotee Bhakta Ramadasa. 

>From tourism point of view, AP Tourism conducts a tourism circuit coverage between
Bhadrachalam, Rajamundry & Papi Kondalu (Hills by name Papi) and the journey is 
through Steamer on River Godavari. This would be anunforgettable experience for 
lovers of nature. 

regs,
sriram
