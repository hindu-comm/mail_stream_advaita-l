Namase,

Some of the rg veda suktas of my acharya Brahmasri Narendra Kapreji have been
uploaded in youtube. 

Shri Kapreji is a perfect rg vedic scholar who hails from maharashtra who won the accolades from Shri Bharati Tirtha Swamigal for his style of vedic chanting. 

To listen to Shri Kapreji's suktas, just type the name of the sukta alongwith guruji's name.

These are the suktas available for listening Agni Sukta, Devi Sukta, Manyu Sukta, Ratri Sukta etc. 

regs,
sriram
