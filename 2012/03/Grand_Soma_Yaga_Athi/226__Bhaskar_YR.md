In the
Sringeri (Mysore) pATha, there is no elongation of certain svaritas. For
example, in "agnimILe purohitaM...", the "hi" in purohitaM is a svarita.

Yes, when I listened this style of chanting for the first time I got 
confused :-)) But in Mysore style of chanting also svarita at the end of 
maNtrAkshara  will be chanted in an elongated form.  For example, 
Rigvedeeya gaNesha sUkta, adAshUshtarasya vedaH, here last akshara 'da' 
with visarga has the svarita, Hence it will be chanted like 'dAH' instead 
of daH as we chant in yajurveda.  Another example  rAtri sUkta, devyA 
akshabhiH, is chanted akshabheeH, since bhi is svarita.  Is there any 
'AdhAra' for this style of chanting??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
