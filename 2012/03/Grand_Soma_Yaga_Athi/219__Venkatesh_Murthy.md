Namaste

With Blessings of many Swamijis-

First time in AP Athiratra Soma Yaga. Must visit must see-

http://athirathram2012apyagna.in/about-athirathram

The Soma Yaga is for 12 days.

It is an “EVENT” that has never been undertaken and performed in the
recent century's' history of “TELUGU SPEAKING AREAS”; now, the
challenge has been undertaken by “SAMATHA LOKSEVA SAMITHI” and it will
be a “Record Event”  to get the famous “NAMBOOTHIRIS” here to our
"TELUGU SPEAKING AREAS", to perform this Supreme Shroutha Soma Yaga,
very near to the banks of river “GODAVARI”. It is also a "Record" in
the history of these famous Namboothiri sects, to go out of Kerala
State and perform this kind of Supreme Shroutha Soma Yaga.
