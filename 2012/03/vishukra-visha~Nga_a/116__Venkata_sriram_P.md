Namaste,

There are 7 commentaries on Lalita Sahasranama.

They are:

1. A great scholar by name vimarshAnandanAtha commented on LS. It has 2000 slokas and the manuscripts are said to be in Adyar Library. It was found in Kamakoti / Kumbakonam Mutt in the form of tALapatrAs.

2. A commentary by Shri Vidyaranya Muni (different from Sringeri Acharya). It has 1500 slokas. It is said that this is preserved in Kashmir (not sure though..).

3. A commentary by Shri Bhatta Narayana (also called Narayana Bhatt) (different from Narayana Bhattatri of Narayaneeyam fame) who was the son of great advaitin Venkatadri Bhatt. His srividya guru was parashivAnandanAtha. This famed commentary is called jayamangaLa. 

4. Another commentary was by Shri Sankara Pandita. This is only a pratipadArtha & tAtparya.

5. A commentary by the great shrauta ritualist and tAntrika Shri Bhaskararaya Makhin under the magnum opus “saubhAgya bhAskara”. 

6. Another commentary was by Shri Kalayananda Bharati of Sringeri Virupaksha Pitha with the name “kalyaNI srIkaLa”. His chief objective of writing this commentary was to refute Shri Bhaskararaya Makhin. Given the chance, he would snub Shri Bhaskararaya Makhin as vAmAchArin. A great scholar challenged Kalyananda Bharati on the authenticity of Bhaskararaya's vAmAchAra worship and the authenticity of Sringeri Virupaksha Pithaand the dispute went to the extent of Vizianagaram District Court for hearing. 

7. Another commentary by name “chandrikAkhya” by a great srividyOpAsaka and advaitin Shri Vidyanatha who was the son of great somayajin Shri Sankaranarayana Yajvin & Smt. Parvatavardhini. The diksha name was Vimalanandanatha. And I was told that Shri Chandrasekhara Bharati used to study this one. 


Among these, Sringeri Parampara has special liking for jayamangaLa, saubhAgya bhAskara and chandrikAkhya. And all three are available with Acharya.
