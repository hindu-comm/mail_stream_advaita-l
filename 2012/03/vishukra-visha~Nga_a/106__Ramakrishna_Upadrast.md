Acccording to the pravachanam of Brahma Shri Samavedam Shanmukha
Sharma Garu on lalitopAkhyAyam, the nAmA-s in the popular versions of
lalitA-sahasranAma have a mistake. They describe

mantriNi/shyAmala killing visha~Nga and
vArAhi/da~mDanAtha killing vishukra

but, according to an ancient version of lalitA-sahasranAma, which is
in conformance with this particular episode in lalitopAkhyAna, the
following is correct:

mantriNi/shyAmala killing vishukra and
vArAhi/da~nDanAtha killing visha~Nga

I request Sri Sriram Garu or some other scholars to explain this discrepancy.

namaste
Ramakrishna
