The Kalyana Sri Kala of Kalyaanaananda Bharati Swami is printed in Telugu characters. It is available for a free download on Archive.org (http://www.archive.org/details/KalyanaSrikala). I am almost certain that there is no Devanagari edition of the same. It is said to contain commentary on some 300 odd naamas (others are said to be guhya, to be learnt directly from the teacher) containing a high level of integration with math/geometry/yantras. This work is said to be critical of the commentary of Sri Bhaskaracharya in certain places. I heard it being said that followers of Swamiji do not follow the interpretation of saubhaagyabhaaskaram, at least not in its entirety.

There is also a separate work of the Swamiji called poorNamimaamsaa which is claimed by one author "to be the most significant original contribution to Advaita Vedanta after Sankara" (I repeat this only to draw attention; my own stance is that I am not in a position to confirm the claim - because I have not understood the work). It is in the form of sutras which prove the unity of Brahman and Atma of the world through geometry, and an auto-commentary by Swamiji. One important sutra is "vrittam Isvarah". Unfortunately I have stopped at that and am unable to move forward.

If anybody is interested, I can forward the sutras and commentary (available in roman script). The book itself might have been in Nagari (though I have not seen it).

Regards
N. Siva Senani
