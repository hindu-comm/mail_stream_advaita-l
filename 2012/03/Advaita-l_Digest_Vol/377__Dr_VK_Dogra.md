> ????????????????????  is the title of a book, in Sanskrit, newly released
> by the Purna prajna samshodhana mandiram, Bangalore. This book is a
> detailed report of a meet held in this institution in March 2010.  The
> discussion is on the pUrva mImAmsA nyAya by the name ????????????? which
> the Advaitins have applied in strength of their tenet.  The effective part
> of the nyAya is: the knowledge had earlier is set aside by the knowledge
> that arises subsequently.  In other words, the knowledge had from the
> shruti pramANa sublates the knowledge had from the pratyakSha, etc. pramANa
> had in the state of ignorance.
> 
> This nyAya was understandably invoked first by the author of the
> 'Brahmasiddhi'. Later, Ananda bodha too has referred to it and Vachaspati
> Mishra has explicitly stated it in the bhAmati.  The nyAyAmRtam authored by
> the savant of the Dvaita school, Sri Vyasatirtha, has extensively
> criticised the Advaitic application of the nyAya and this has been replied
> by the Advaita siddhi of Madhusudana Saraswati.  The name
> '????????????????????' actually occurs in the nyAyAmRtam. Much deliberation
> has taken place with this nyAya as the subject matter between the Advaitins
> and the Dvaitins.
> 
> In the above book one finds that the renowned pUrvamImAmsA and Advaita
> scholar Dr.Mani Dravid SastriNaH has expressed the view that Sri
> VyAsatirtha has not adhered to the method of the  pUrvamImAmsA shAstra
> while showing the disagreement/contradiction (????????) to the Advaitin's
> application of the nyAya.  This view has been debated in the said
> discussion which is fully covered in the above book. The Dvaita scholars
> Dr. D.Prahladacharya, Dr.Haridasa Bhattacharya and Vidwan Ruchira Acharya
> have defended the nyAyAmRtam handling of the nyAya while Dr.Mani Dravid
> SastriNaH has stuck to his stand.
> 
> This book offers a detailed view of the nyAya, its implications and the
> various issues it brings forth.  In 42 pages of good print, the book is
> priced at Rs.60 and is available at the Samshodhana Mandiram office: Phone:
> 080 26694026, email: ppsmb1 at gmail.com.
> 
> I found the presentation very interesting and would recommend it to a
> student of any school of Vedanta.  By reading such books one gets to know a
> lot of details pertaining to Vedanta, both Advaita and Dvaita, NyAya,
> pUrvamImAmsA and in the passing, of the vyAkaraNa shAstra too.  This
> benefit is certainly a bonus to the reader. It expands his vision and
> deepens his thinking capacity. One can see how the four shAstra-s form a
> fine team in contributing to the final understanding.
