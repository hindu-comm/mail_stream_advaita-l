In this URL one can find recordings of the Vivekachudamani classes (in
Sanskrit):

http://www.poornaprajna.com/archives2.html

These were recorded at the Purnaprajna Vidyapeetha, Bangalore, where the
classes were conducted recently.  On these days special lectures on the
Darshana-s were also delivered by noted scholars, all in Sanskrit.  These
too, are available in the above URL.  All these are to be found in the
above page at the latter half.

When I had announced the above program some months ago, some members had
expressed the desire to hear the talks.  That desire stands now fulfilled.
