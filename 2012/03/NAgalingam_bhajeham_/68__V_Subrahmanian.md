A nice composition in Sanskrit.

The lyrics are available here:

A very significant line here is: Agma shAstra purANa prasangam
avidyA-bhangam ati-dhavaLAngam

This means: This Lingam is the cause/source (shAstrayonitvAt) of the Agama
shAstra purANa (the entire scriptural lore) destroys AvidyA and is an
embodiment of purity.  In Advaita the stage up to enlightenment is within
the realm of mAyA.  And this climax of destruction of avidya is enabled by
the Lord, Ishwara.  Effecting this, the entire samsara including the
Ruler-ruled duality gets sublated.

The song can be heard here:
