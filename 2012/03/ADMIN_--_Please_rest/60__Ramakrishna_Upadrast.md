namaste,

When clubbing together the replies to different posters, maybe under
the same subject, kindly do not remove the initial part of the reply
which hints who wrote that particular text. It helps readers to
correlate to some extant "who is saying what". Without this, the mails
become a quick mash of opinions and counter opinions difficult to
track.

Further, it is helpful if the text quoted by you of the previous
poster has > symbol at the beginning of each line, and the text typed
by you does not have the same.

namaste
Ramakrishna
