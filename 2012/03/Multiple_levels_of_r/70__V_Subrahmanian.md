There is a town/village in Tamilnadu named 'SundarapAnDiyapuram' :

Apart from the quotes provided by Jaladhar ji  from the AdhyAsa bhashya,
there are others that were cited in this thread from Shankara's own quotes
such as the 'siddham tu nivartakatvAt' as 'AgamavidAm Sutram' which has a
bearing on the multiple levels of reality.  And the famous
'adhyAropa-apavAdAbhyAm....' quoted by Shankara as that of 'sampradAyavida
AhuH' is also evidence to the multiple levels of reality being in the
sampradaya dating much earlier to Shankara and Gaudapada.
