Namaste

I heard a wife and children get the share of a man's Phala from
Dharmic and Punya Karmas but if he does Adharmic and Papa Karmas they
will not get any share. All the Papa Karma Phalas go to the man only
fully.

I want to hear Sastra reference for this in our Dharma Shastras. There
is a story of Valmiki and his wife and children but it is not clearly
explained with references.
