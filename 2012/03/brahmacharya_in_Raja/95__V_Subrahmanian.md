Yes.  Even in the case of PrahlAda who was born in the asura kula we see
the total difference in the make up.  Factors like IshvarAnugraha and
self-effort do have a role in the making of an exalted person.  In
prahlAda's case Narada's intervention at the pregnancy stage itself turned
out to be the chief input.  In Dhruva's case the Mother's
goading/encouragement and Narada's upadesha and grace along with his own
determination brought about a collective effect.
