Namaste

Kindly see- http://ramsevatrust.org/index.php/ashvamedhayaga

The Ashwamedha Yajna was done because of  Vision of Sri Rama Avadhoota
of Hasan. He did Anjaneya penance for many years. He fasted 48 days.
His Guru is Sri Sridhara Swamiji. He said in one TV interview (TV 9
news) one horse came to him one night. He got vision to perform
Ashwamedha Yajna with that horse. That horse was taken to many many
parts of Karnataka and came back. This took one year to complete. I
think he got some priests from Kerala well versed in Srauta rituals to
do the Ashwamedha for him. He got support from ex CM. He was there on
first day. There were 600 Ritwiks for doing Ashwamedha and other
Yajnas.

I think this is not like the Gayatri Pariwar Ashwamedha at all.  It is
different because so many Ritwiks were there. But was it done
correctly? This is my question.
