Namaste,

I am trying to prove the Ashwamedha in Doddapura cannot be correct
duration because they did it for 7 days

The 13th & 14th sarga of the same kANDa do mention of the time span for this yajna.
The yajamAna has to undergo purificatory rites for 1 year (from vasanta ritu to vasanta 
ritu of subsequent year) for performing this yajna. 

Moreover, considering some of the factors in kali yuga, dharma sastras prohibit this yajna in kali yuga. 

sriram
