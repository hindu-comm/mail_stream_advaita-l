Namaste

My friend has given this information.

In the History of Dharma Sastra Kane has said about knowledge of
Ashwamedha in Mahabharata -
'The author does not depict what he has seen but only what he has heard or read'

In Dwapara Yuga also Ashwamedha was not common like in Treta Yuga in
Valmiki's time.

In the Satapatha Brahmana  Ashwamedha is started in Phalguna Masa but
Mahabharata says the ending is on Caitra full moon day.
