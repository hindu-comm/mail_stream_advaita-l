Because some Rajput Kings did Ashwamedha how can you say it is allowed
in KaliYuga? There are so many things prohibited now but not before.
There will be bad people breaking rules all the time. Can we say the
rules are all useless? Probably because the Rajputs did banned Yajna
they lost to Muslim invaders. Banned Yajna gives bad effect.

There are very strong reasons to ban Ashwamedha Yajna today. Some
reasons are given below. There were practices like Vamachara in that.

Caution- Brahmacharis, Sanyasis and children should not read anything
below. Stop here.

In Ashwamedha a dog is killed by a prostitute's son and thrown under
the horse's feet. Many animals are sacrificed some from Bovine
species. The king has to sleep at night placing his head in thighs of
one queen. They sacrifice the horse itself. Then the Chief Queen will
come and sleep with the dead horse. The Adhvaryu will cover both of
them with a cloth. Then the Chief Queen will have sex with the dead
horse. Katyayana Srauta Sutra has said Ashwashishnam Upasthe Kurute.
She has to put the dead horse's ---- in her ---- The other Queens and
the female attendants will have sex conversation with the other
Rutwijas like Brahma and others. In the morning the say the
Dadhikravna Mantra for purification.

The above practices are like the indecent Vamachara Tantra rituals.
They cannot be done by decent people in Kali Yuga. In other Yugas it
was allowed because people had very strong will power and very pure
mind. But now everybody is weak and will always think bad and negative
of the rituals. Another reason there is no King now. The Ashwamedha is
banned in Kali Yuga.
