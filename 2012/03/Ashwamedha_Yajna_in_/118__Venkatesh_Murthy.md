Ramayana Bala Kanda 1-13

33 tryaho 'śvamedhaḥ saṃkhyātaḥ kalpasūtreṇa brāhmaṇaiḥ
   catuṣṭomam ahas tasya prathamaṃ parikalpitam
34 ukthyaṃ dvitīyaṃ saṃkhyātam atirātraṃ tathottaram
   kāritās tatra bahavo vihitāḥ śāstradarśanāt
35 jyotiṣṭomāyuṣī caiva atirātrau ca nirmitau
   abhijid viśvajic caiva aptoryāmo mahākratuḥ

In  Ramayana Valmiki has said Ashwamedha Yajna was done with others
like Chatushtoma, Ukthya, Atiratra, Jyotishtoma, Aptoryama, Abhijit
and Visvajit.
What is the total duration of Ashwamedha? How many days?
