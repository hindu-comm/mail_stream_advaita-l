Numerous kings of the gupta dynasty are historically documented as having
performed the aSvamedha. They ruled well within the kali yuga timeframe
and they probably also sacrificed a real horse as part of the ritual. See, for
example http://www.nupam.com/Sgupta1.html.

If you read the details of the news item, they have mentioned the common
paurANika homa-s like sahasra caNDI, sudarSana homa etc, so it is not the
same as the kingly aSvamedha ritual done in bygone times.
