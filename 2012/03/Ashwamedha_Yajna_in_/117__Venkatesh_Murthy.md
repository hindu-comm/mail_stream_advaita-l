Namaste

In Kali Yuga nobody should be doing Ashwamedha Yajna. But in Doddapura
in Karnataka they are doing it from 29 February to March 6.

http://m.timesofindia.com/PDATOI/articleshow/12091305.cms

Ashwamedha is for Kings and Kshatriyas only. But who is doing it here?
They are saying it is Symbolic Yajna and they have kept a horse. But
they will offer a horse doll in the sacrifice not the real horse.

What is the procedure for this Symbolic Yajna? Any details.
