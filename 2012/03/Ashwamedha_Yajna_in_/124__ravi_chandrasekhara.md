(There is an organization called Gayatri Parivar, which conducts an event
almost every year, called aSvamedha, but the central ritual done is only
gAyatrI homa. They get thousands of people to recite gAyatrI mantra as
part of this event. It is *called* aSvamedha for press release purposes,
but there is no point in finding fault with the "correctness" or otherwise
of what they do. The point they want to make is that the phala of doing
this kind of yajna should be considered equal to the phala of doing an
aSvamedha.

Dear All,
Not to digress too much but Gayatri Pariwar is not a standard as they allow all to chant Gayatri regardless of varna, samskara, or gender. They in some ways are akin to nastika Arya Samaj.
