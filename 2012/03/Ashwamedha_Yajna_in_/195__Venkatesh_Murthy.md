It means they were not following Dharma. But many Kings did not do
Ashwamedha out of respect for Dharma. You are not seeing this.

There is a Guru Parampara for Sannyasis from Adi Shankara to modern
day. Where is Sampradaya for Ashwamedha Yajna from a King in history
to modern day? There is no Sampradaya for Ashwamedha even in recent
Kings. Because there is Sannyasa Sampradaya we can accept it. But
because there is no Ashwamedha Sampradaya we cannot accept it if
someone today is doing it. If there is no Sampradaya there is no
trained Srauta Brahmins to act as Rutwijas in this Yajna. No Veda
Pathashala is training Brahmins for Ashwamedha Yajna. You are missing
this point.

Sishtacara is also against Ashwamedha. No Sista wants to sacrifice and
other animals and do indecent acts.

>From many angles like Dharma Sastra text books, Sampradaya and
Sisctacara it is wrong to do Ashwamedha now.
