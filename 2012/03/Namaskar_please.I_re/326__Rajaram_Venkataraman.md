If you don't like the meaning (ha = Siva etc.) of the mantra ( hare Krishna
...) that the source ( Radha Tantra ) tells you, you should for another
source ( kalisantarana  upanishad ) that gives a mantra ( hare rama ... )
with the meaning ( he krishna etc. ) close to what you like. You can't
negotiate with the author of Radha Tantra to change the meaning :)
