In the Advaita tradition it is popularly held that the author of the famous
poem 'viditAkhila-shAstra-sudhA-jaladhe...' in the tOTaka meter is
toTakAchARya also known as Giri.  While browsing the net I came across a
book on Brahmasutra published by the Divine Life Society.

In this book at the beginning are given some hymns and one is the above, on
the 11th page,  with the author being stated as: HastAmalakAchArya.

Is there any tradition that holds the authorship of the stated stotram as
Hastamalakacharya's composition?
