Translation of that paragraph by Trevor Leggett in his book 'The Chapter of the Self' :

"And furthermore one must take note that there are differences in (degree of clarity of) Knowledge, which may be weak or middling or perfect. For even among those who have Knowledge f Brahman, not all have the same attainment of Brahman; for the highest degree of discriminative knowledge (viveka) is found in (only) some of them, and there is the holy text 'He is highest among the Brahman-knowers' (Mund 3.1.4) and the tradition 'perfect in right vision' (Manu VI.74)."

Subject: [Advaita-l] brahmavidAmapi na sarvEshAm samA brahma pratipattiH

Adhyatma Patala Bhashya 

Sutra 11: dhOshhAnAm tu nirghAtO ...
Bhashya :

paragraph starting as follows:

manda-madhyamOttama vidyApEkshatvAcca |
brahmavidAmapi na sarvEshAm samA brahma pratipattiH 
vivEkAtiShaya darshanAt kasyacit 'Eha brahmavidAm varishhthaH' iti shrutEH |

'samyagdarshana sampanaH' iti ca smritEH |

Is this idea available and supported in Brahma Sutra Bhashya?

Regards

Srikrishna
