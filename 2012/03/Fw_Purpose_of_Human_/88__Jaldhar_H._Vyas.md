That Prem Sabhlok is an Aryasamajist nastika. Do not forward his nonsense 
here it does not belong.

In general unless the person is a recognized Advaitin (i.e. no new agers, 
garden variety "mystics" etc.) or it is directly relevant to a topic under 
discussion don't forward mails at all.  We would much rather read your own 
thoughts on Advaita Vedanta even if you don't feel you are a scholar or 
expert.
