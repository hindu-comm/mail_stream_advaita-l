A few drops from the ocean of Vedic Knowledge- Purpose of Human Birth: "Prem Sabhlok" psabhlok at hotmail.com 

Thu Mar1,2012 5:37pm (PST)

Revive Vedas and strengthen Sanatan Dharma- eternal religion based on Vedic Dharma.

Rtam, Satyam. Dharmmam (Rig Veda)- Rta (Cosmic Laws of Necessity) are Satyam (eternal truth) and following these Rta (cosmic laws) is Dharma. Even God follows sternly these cosmic Laws. Bhagavd Gita also confirms this Veodic eternal truth.

Know Thy Vedas
OM Khamm Brahma- OM Thy name is God. In Vedas Shabad Brahma (Cosmic Word) is OM.
Dear seekers of Vedic knowledge,
Subject: Purpose of Human Birth- as described in Vedas

In this phenomenal world of an illusion of comfort in the vast sea of turbulent matter a number of views are prevalent about the purpose of life and human birth.
To know the purpose of life an effort was made to study Rig Veda which was accorded the status of world Heritage by UNESCO during 2007. According to (RV 1-24-1, 4-33-11, 61-79-1) the purpose of human birth is to assist God (Vishwakarma- the Supreme Designer) in the maintenance of social, moral and physical order so that the entire mankind becomes divine bureaucracy of God to ensure implementation and maintenance of His wondrous Design. The Cosmic laws of Nature (Rta) are formidable and despotic in their operation and even God Him self having created obeys these laws sternly. Truthful search of these laws and obeying Rta is the greatest service to God. 
Thus the Purpose of life is to fulfill the divine mission of God and Prakrti (divine Nature) by resorting to welfare activities for the entire mankind (Vishwa Kutumbkam- the Global Family of our formless and ineffable God) and all animate and inanimate life. It only proves that selfless social work on the path of Rta is the only divine work.
Those human beings who understand the purpose of human birth and follow cosmic laws of Nature (Vedic Rta) can become Paramjot- carriers of divine light (divine Vedic knowledge) and they can realize God in one birth. Vedas and Upanishads tell us if human beings born in the image of God, if they do not realize God in one birth, they are the losers. Incidentally image of God is mentioned in the context of God is Parmatma- the Supreme Soul and only human beings have got Atma- our Real Self the omniscient principle Soul. The animals, birds, fishes etc do not have omniscient principle but have €’³energy principle€’´ i.e. Spirit. Thus Sattavic, Rajasic and Tamasic Gunas only affect the manifested soul (jivatma) of human beings and not the spirit of animals etc. 

Vedas tell us when the jivatma (manifested soul) is surrounded by predominance of subtle Tamasic gunas of impurity and stupor, the ap-riori Vedic knowledge conatined in the human soul is affectd by the vehement effect of MAYA which creates a Golden Lid and hides the noble and divine knowledge and creates an illusion of comort in the this vast turbulent sea of matter. 

By following Vedic Rta affect of Maya starts disappearing and purpose of human birth becomes clear to mankind.

Apart from what Vedas say about the purpose of life, many other Vedic concepts regarding Good, Charity, Love, Enlightened Liberalism, harmonized divine, spiritual and material Knowledge (Jnan), physical sciences and scientific temper, Vedic Economics and many others have been described in the book €’³Glimpses of Vedic Metaphysics€’´. The book (about 350 pages) is available on the Internet for on-line reading/down loading/taking print at no cost and can be accessed through Search Engines of Google.com/Yahoo. com/ Lulu.com. Also the book can be accessed through the Website http://www.sabhlokc ity.com/metaphys ics.

Yours spiritual Brother,
