Is sayujya same as as advaita siddhi? Sri Shyam's response to my post in
the other post is very relevant to this.

The commentary on the vivekacUDAmaNi (verse 2) by Sri candraSekhara bhAratI
svAminaH mentions that
"sAlokya-sAmIpya-sArUpya-sAyujya" cannot be considered be truly mukti. The
commentary is in

An english translation
of the same is in
