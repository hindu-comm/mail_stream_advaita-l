Pujya Sadaji,

///
Jnaaniâ€™s life style will be influenced by powerful shaastra vaasanas and jnaanam

//

Kindly elaborate the above sentence. What is shAstra vAsana w.r.t to jnAni's charya.

Can we say it as other way round ie., whatever a jnani does becomes a dharma sukshma
for ajnanis and whatever He utters becomes a shAstra vAkya. 

Because, shAstra vAsana is again a *vAsana* which is no more present in a jnAni.

regs,
sriram
