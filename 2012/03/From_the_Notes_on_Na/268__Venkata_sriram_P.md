Pujya Sadaji,

I concur with what you say regarding the jnAni charya w.r.t. pAramArthika driSTi.

However, my objection was :

//
Jnaaniâ€™s life style will be influenced by powerful shaastra vaasanas and jnaanam
//

I understand that from pArmArthika driSTi, there is neither prArabdha nor a jnAni because
nAdabindu upaniSad says "ajnAna jana bOdArthaM prArabdhaM iti cha uchyatE". 

But, my point is you have used the term *shAstra vAsana* for jnAni's charya which
is from vyAvahArika driSTi. This is one among the vAsana-traya and vAsana is 
described as *dhriDa bhAvanayA tyakta pUrvApara vichAraNaM yadAdAnaM padArthasya vAsana sA prakIrtitA* which implies it is again a chitta vikSEpa. And shAstra vAsana is
one among such vikSEpAs. So, even if we are trying to assess a jnAni from vyavahArika
perspective, how can we define such a person a jnAni when there is still the traces of shAstra vAsana.

Moreover,your notes are based on the4th chapter of naiSkarmya siddhi. 
That chapter doesn't mention any such wordas "vAsana" for a jnAni's charya. 

regs,
sriram
