> It is not proper to claim that Madhusoodana Saraswati considered Sdvaita-siddhi to be different from attaining Sayujya-Mukti. Sayujya means the oneness with the Lord. According to the Bhagavatam the ardent bhakta gets the Jnana through Lord's grace (and this occurs in the very present life without the need for anther life for Krama-Mukti) and thereby obviously the Jnani-bhakta attains Sayujya-Mukti

No Swami. If you see Bhagavatam, sayujyam is treated as one of the five types of liberation. A devotee shuns that. He attains the state of Vishnu. You can see the commentary of Sridhara Swami on this. Madhusudana follows this quite. Sringeri Periyava is quite right, ( who are we to certify him? :)), in saying that sayujya is different from Advaita Siddhi.

As I said earlier, in saloka, you have to go to the world of a particular god that you really like. In sarupya, you have to assume the form of the Lord that you like. This is all in the realm of Hiranyagarbha. In sayujya, you become one with Avyakta. But Advaita Siddhi is different. You attain the state of Vishnu, who is beyond all names and forms.
