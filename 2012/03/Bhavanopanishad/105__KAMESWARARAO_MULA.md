Dear Atma Bandhu's,
Here I tried to translate with some understanding and also copied from other source for the translation of Bhavana Upanishad.
Bhavanopanishad from Atharvana-Veda, one of ourancient veda's helps in thepathof theSelf-Realization & Tradition
of the Himalayan masters in simplified way. The goal of any sadhana should be the
highest Joy that comes from the Realization in direct experience of the center
of consciousness, the Self, the Atman or Purusha, which is one and the same
with the Absolute Reality.Self-Realization comes through Yoga meditation
of the Yoga Sutras, the contemplative insight of Advaita Vedanta, and the
intense devotion of Samaya Sri Vidya . In general lassical approaches are of Raja,
Jnana, Karma, and Bhakti Yoga, Hatha, Kriya, Kundalini, Laya,
Mantra, Nada, Siddha Yoga. Meditation & contemplation of prayer finally converge into a unified force directed towards the final stage,
piercing the pearl of wisdom(1000petaledLotus) called bindu, leading to the Absolute.
Here goes the Bhavanopnasihad.
Om ! Gods ! With ears let us
hear what is good;

Adorable ones ! With eyes let us see what is good.

With steady limbs, with bodies, praising,

Let us enjoy the life allotted by the gods.

May Indra, of wide renown, grant us well-being;

May Pusan, and all-gods, grant us well-being.

May Tarksya, of unhampered movement, grant us well-being.

May Brihaspati grant us well-being.

Om !
Peace ! Peace ! Peace !
