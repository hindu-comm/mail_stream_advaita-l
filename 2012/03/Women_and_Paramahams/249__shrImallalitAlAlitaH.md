I dont have yatidharmaprakAsha.
And, please note that I'm opposed to only a specific type of saMnyAsa for
women. And, the verse hinted by you faces the same fate as mahAbhArata
verses in my view for given causes.
Another thing, yatidharmaprakAsha is not a smRRiti, so it must borrow it's
validity from other texts.
