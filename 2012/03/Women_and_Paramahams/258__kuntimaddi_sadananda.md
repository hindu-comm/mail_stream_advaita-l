PraNAms 

In the Jiivan mukta viveka  Shree Vidyaranya defines many subcategories under sanyaasa. 

In the bhagavatam, in Kapilopadesa, after sage kapila taught his mother Devahuti, there is a description in terms of how Devahuti spent the rest of her life in Nidhidhyaasana. She was more like a avadhuta sanyaasini as was not even aware of if she had dress on her or not. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
