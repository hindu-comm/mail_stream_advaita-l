Yes Sriram - Thanks. I rember reading the prose summary of laghu yoga vaashiShsheTa many years ago. 


Actually Swami Tejomayanandaji has put together some verses from Yoga VashiShTa as Yoga VashiShRa saara sangrahaH about 100 slokas or so and the book has been published by Central Chinmaya Mission.  I am planning to take the first part of that book for a two day spiritual camp in Washingont during the Memorial Day week end. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
