Namaste Subbuji,

/////

That Shankara is quoting from the Mahabharatha, a smRti, is evident from
this episode found in the shAntiparvan (MokShadharma) therein:

//

The exact quote from Mahabharata is here:

bhikSukItyanEna strINAMapi prAgvivAhadvA vaidhavyAdUrdhwaM 
sanyAsE(a)adhikArOstIti darshitaM / tEna bhikSAcharyaM mOkSashAstra
shravaNaM EkAntE AtmadhyAnaM cha tAbhirapi kartavyaM
*tridaNDAdikaM* cha dhAryaM

Which implies sanyasa was given to women who used to have tridaNDa etc.
However, the adhikAra is before marriage or after attaining widowhood.

regs,
sriram
