Just because they are stories they do not cease to be pramANa-s for drawing
a lot of lessons.  Shankara does not discount a story just because it is
so; the lesson drawn from them is specifically brought out by Him.  Even
the 'sulabhA' case is one such; Shankara cites it, despite it being a story
told by someone to someone in the mahaabharata, in support of what is being
discussed in the BSB.  Every story in the Jivanmuktiviveka is cited only to
drive home this or that lesson.  Be it Yajnavalkya's behaviour or
Bhagiratha's, Vidyaranya brings out a strong lesson to the aspirant.
Shankara, at the beginning itself says in the Kathopanishat that there is
an 'AakhyAyikA' here for vidyAstuti.  Yet every event in the story is a
source to teach us this or that lesson.  From a dialogue between Yama and
his family members Shankara concludes: तस्मात् अनुपेक्षणीयः सर्वावस्थास्वपि
अतिथिरियर्थः। This story forms a basis for actual conduct in the world.
One can see how a vidhi is taught through the story. And nIlakanTha is not
inventing a vidhi from the story; he is giving an explanation which
Vidyaranya too approves.

The episode was cited not just because sulabhA talked about Brahman.  She
ultimately advised Janaka on varNAshrama dharma. And Shankara is citing it
not because it was a deceiver teaching  some philosophy; He uses the word
'brahmavAdinI'.  And Vyasa is also not espousing the cause of some
philosophy; it is the vedantic moksha that was being tested.

We are discussing a case that Shankara has cited and Vidyaranya has spoken
of.

All the episodes in the scriptures are only AkhyAyika-s one way or the
other.  In fact stories within purANas and the mahAbharata are there only
to teach valuable lessons for one to follow in real experience.  If this
were not possible, no one would have spent so much time and energy in
incorporating those stories into their works.

Veda vyAsa has mentioned buddha, etc. as pUrvapakSha.  Everyone knows that
the sulabhaa story was not meant to be a pUrvapakSha to be refuted.
Shankara does not consider the sulabhA instance as something avaidika.
