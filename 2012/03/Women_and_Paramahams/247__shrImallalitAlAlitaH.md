Yes, you are correct in saying that different sources define the term
paramahaMsa differently.
But, I was opposing the view according to definitions of
paramahaMsopaniShat and shrI-vidyAraNya. And it was the view which shrI V.
Subrahmanian was considering while talking, I think. So, my oppositions
holds good here.
Moreover, I've not seen any shruti or smR^iti defining paramahaMsa-s as
tri-daNDI-s. I've seen refutation of this view in a few commentaries of
smR^iti-s.

Even unavailability of niShedha is not needed to bar women from saMnyAsa.
Why ?
Because, women can't shun karma.
Why ?
Because, they are not in possession of karma. By karma I mean vaidika karma
here.
There is no need to shun laukika karma with prAjApatyeShTi and virajA homa.
The karma which was received with vidhi is to be shunned with vidhi in
order to avoid pratyavAya. laukika-karma-s are not prescribed with vidhi.
So, as soon as need or desire goes, one is seen to leave them without being
subject to any pratyavAya.

Actually, non-occurance of tridaNDa-saMnyAsa of women in past(I don't mean
50 years only), is enough to show that it was not followed by shiShTa-s.
Only 18 dharma-shAstra-s are counted as smR^iti in tradition, which
comprise manu-smR^iti, pArAshara-smR^iti, etc. They mainly deal with Achara
of varNAshrama, prAyashchitta, etc. in details.
As dharma-shAstra-s and itihAsa, both are mentioned separately. So, clearly
an itihAsa is not smR^iti. It is quoted as smR^iti, because it does same
work as dharmashAstra-s. So, it's a gauNa-prayoga.
According to manu and sha¬Nkara-bhagavatpAda, only brAhmaNa can take
saMnyAsa.
Some people say that traivarNika-s can take saMnyAsa as there is some sUtra
which says : trayANAM varNAnAM vedamadhItya chatvAra AshramAH.
Now, the method to take saMnyAsa, which says that one should install agnI
inside after doing prAjApatya, is enough to prove that women can't do this.
They are not given agnI.
Anyway, there is a sUtra from baudhAyana, which say : strINAM chaike. Some
people accept saMnyAsa of women. So, I accept that a special school follows
this rule. But, this is the rule followed by main-streams, is difficult to
say. Because, it is opposed to the views expressed above. And,
pArAshara-smR^iti, which is prescribed for kali-yuga, and it's
mAdhavIya-TIkA don't say anything about saMnyAsa of women and others while
dealing with adhikAra of saMnyAsa. So, one can also say that view of
baudhAyana is not for this yuga.

So, let me make it clear again that :
I mean that women can't take saMnyAsa with the paddhatI mentioned due to
lack of karma, yaGYopavIta, agnI, etc.
I mean that their saMnyAsa was never allowed by main-stream
vaidika-s(mImAMsaka-s, both pUrva and uttara).
They can take saMnyAsa with the same ritual, because they are faithful to
vedAnta, guru, etc. and guru is willing; but it is not meant for them.
A special type of saMnyAsa is accepted for women and anyone else, which is
marked by uparatI from kAmya-karma and it gives them time for shravaNa,
etc. It is accepted by shrI-vidyAraNya.

I accept. I'm not opposing saMnyAsa of laukika karma by women. I'm opposing
saMnyAsa of vaidika karma by women which is marked by special rituals.

It also goes unopposed. I've no problem in accepting that women and others
can shun their little wealth, i.e. kAmya-laukika-karma.

She may not be outsider regarding philosophy, i.e. vedAnta. But, her
tridaNDa shows that she was not following norms of vaidika-s.

That's what I just said. She was a brahmavAdinI, a knower of philosophy of
vedAnta, but not respectful to other aspects of veda-s.
Or,
It may be : that she didn't do rituals to shun karma-s, she vowed to
renounce kAmya-laukika-karma without ritual and her tridaNDa-s, which are
signs of vAg-daNDa, etc., were also taken without ritual. In this case,
I've no problem. I accept that anything in this world can happen without
mantra-s and ritual-s.

Those who gave saMnyAsa in such manner are subject to the doubt of
orthodoxy.

Let me say something here:
If 'being not negated in clear words' is the only criteria to bar women
from saMnyAsa, then people outside varNAshrama-dharma and animals will
become eligible for saMnyAsa on the account of being not negated in clear
terms.
And,
As 'lack of vidhi' doesn't mean 'prohibition', so 'lack of prohibition'
doesn't imply 'validity'.
