A supporting cause is not the doer.

I already said that they are stories, and they have no base in actual
world. You can't make vidhi-s because you heard some story.

Q: How to decide that someone is being handled by God and not disrespect
towards scriptures ?
A: Because he can talk about brahma.
Q: It doesn't hold good. Many deceivers are seen teaching various
philosophies.

Not only that. I know that tridaNDa-dhAraNa is not prescribed for women.
So, for me your faith is not enough. Your faith may work for you and
nIlakaNTha, but to persuade someone else you need to propound in a
different way. Otherwise giving benefit of doubt will make Osho, etc.
vaidika.

 The Veda-vyAsa mentioned case does not raise such doubts.  For he is

Then remember that bhIShma is telling a story, an akhyAyikA and not
translating a real experience.
Or,
veda-vyAsa mentioned buddha, chArvAka, etc. also. So are they also
followers of vaidika-rules and nyAya-s of mImAMsA on account of being
mentioned by him ?
