Subbuji - PraNAms

I think there is a story or discussion or teaching by the queen who has realized to her husband King, who has not yet realized in Yoga vaashiShTa. -This is reverse of Maitreyee brahmana. 

Not sure the date of the text may be of 11th century, much before vidyaranya.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
