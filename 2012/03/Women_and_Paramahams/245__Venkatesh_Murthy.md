'The senior Pejavara Swamiji recently gave Sannyasa to a prominent
female political member of the Bharatiya Janata Party. When I asked
the Pejavara Swamiji why he had gone out of the way and given Sannyasa
to a woman he replied, ' She was deeply interested in leading a life
devoted to service in the name of God and she wanted to be initiated
by a Madhva Sannyasi. Besides, she had been asking me since a very
long time.'
