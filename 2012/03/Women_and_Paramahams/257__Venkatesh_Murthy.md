Namaste Sri Vidyasankara

Recently I got one book called as Paramahamsa Dharma Nirnayaha written
by Ramananda Saraswati. This book is by Chandrasekhara Bharati Trust.
In that-
 प्रकरणम् ३- अधिकारिनिर्णयः
पूर्वमेवोक्तं लिंगधारणप्रयुक्तसंन्यासाश्रमे ब्राह्मणा एव अधिकारिण इति
। ब्राह्मणेष्वपि तीव्रतरवैराग्यवन्तः मुमुक्षव एवाधिकृताः
परमहंसाश्रमस्वीकारे ।
It is saying only Brahmins having very much Vairagya can become
Sannyasis. No mention of other Dvijas and Stri and Sudras.

I think Sri Lalitalalitaha is correct.
