Thanks for posting this.  I was thinking of the same line from
bRhadaraNyakopanishad for the  last few days. aatmanas tu kaamaaya
sarvam priyam bhavati.  aacharya's words svasvaruupa anusandhaaanam
bhaktiriti uchyate  is pretty precise and reflects this. Even the
prema ruupa of bhakti is because of this only.

I think this bhakti is an innate nature of jiva-s just like gravity in
the physical universe.
