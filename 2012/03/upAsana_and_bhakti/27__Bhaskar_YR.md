Atleast Advaita-l is not on yahoo plateform. Hence it shows unicode very
well. We have no problem with it. You may check your OS,etc. for support.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I cannot do that !!  & show these mails to my system administrator as I am 
using my official ID for the communication with advaita list :-))  Anyway, 
I thought somany others also having the same problem in reading it, now I 
understand  that  it it is only my problem due to my desktop & related 
systems...Please carry on your dialogues in Sanskrit  with Sri Subbu 
prabhuji, it should not stop just because of single person not able to 
read it.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
