Namaste Satish,

Your point of distinguishing between "following mantra marga" and "reciting a mantra as part of worship" is well taken. However - 


"So a proper upAsaka/mantrin's practice is quite different from both, in 
the process and in the attitude with which they approach 
mantra-s/deities"

upAsana=mantra mArga is also not very accurate. Mantra-devata-upAsana is one form of upAsana, though perhaps most common. Any systematic pursuit is usually called an upAsana - for instance nAdopAsana, nirguNopAsana etc.
