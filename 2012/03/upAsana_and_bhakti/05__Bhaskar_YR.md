In Vedanta, bhakti is perhaps best characterized thus in these verses of
the Tenth chapter of the Bhagavadgita:

praNAms
Hare Krishna

And we can also recall bhagavAn's assurance in verse : 
ananyAschintayantOmAm ye janAH paryupAsate...However, I think,  these are 
all within the scope of veda / vedAntic sAdhana for chitta shuddhi.  But 
what Sri Satish prabhuji emphasizing ( and to the extent Sri Ramesh 
prabhuji) is something 'new' to most of us.  If what they are telling 
falls  outside the scope of veda/vedAntic  sAdhana/upAsana, then we dont 
have to scratch our heads but we can learn from them only from the 
academic point of view. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
