This smacks of prejudice on your part.  Upasana of the type you are 
describing depends on faith just as much as bhakti does. Trying to invoke 
science in matters of faith just muddies the waters.

Are you implying that only mantrins perform nyAsa?  The Bhagavata purana 
in the 6th skandha includes the anga and kara nyasa for the Narayana 
kavacha.  Yet this is in a context replete with bhakti bhava.  I guess I'm 
just not seeing this dividing line you claim there is between bhakti and 
upasana so let me turn your question around to you.  Why do you think 
bhaktas perform nyasa?

Hold on, what does the word "really" mean here?  Deities are described 
in shastras as having physical humanoid shape, aniconic forms such as 
lingam or shaligram, abstract geometric forms such as yantras, and words 
such as mantras.  Which is one is "real"?

The Vedantic response is that they can all be real.  What is to be avoided 
is fixation on one form that limits the understanding of the divine to 
ones own limited conception for that limit is unreality.  This is 
certainly a critique which can be aimed at bhaktas but it can also be 
applied to the Purva Mimamsakas and others who could not conceive of 
devatas outside of the mantras.

Duly noted.  Also see the following from the last paragraph of your link:

"There is also a small category, which is heartlessly ritualistic and 
treats tantra as an experiment that involves mixing of chemicals – devoid 
of soul, _bhakti_ and the certain ‘z’ factor that makes it all work...
I appeal to the _lotus_feet_of_parA-bhaTTArikA_borne_on_the_shiraH_of_ 
mahAbhairava"

That most of the sadhakas are at a lower level of understanding and don't 
reach/are not capable of the higher levels of sadhana is not a novel 
insight.  But you are throwing out the baby with the bathwater if you are 
trying to claim that all devotion to a form occurs at the level of 
emotion only.

If bhakti is not stabilizing the mind then it is failing its mission on 
its own terms without even bringing mantrashastra into the picture.  We 
have previously discussed Shankaracharyas critique of the Pancharatra 
chaturvyuhavada in Brahsutrabhashya 2.2.42-45 which gives the clearest 
view of his approach to bhakti.  He says in part:

yadapi tasya bhagavato.abhigamanAdilakShaNArAdhanamajasramananyachittatayAbhipreyate
tadapi na pratiShidhyate shrutismR^ityorIshvarapraNidhAnasya prasiddhatvAt |

"neither is the Bhagavatas' practice of reverential approach [to the 
murti] etc. for the purpose of causing unceasing concentration on the 
Highest being objected to as that one should meditate on the Lord is known 
from Shruti and Smrti."

The blog you quote from begs to differ.  And really what is so funny about 
it?  What makes a sadhana "Vedantic" (Strictly speaking "Advaita Vedantic"
we should say) is that it causes a falling away from duality.  Some forms 
of bhakti or yoga or tantra etc. can do this.  Others can't.  It's the 
former that we are interested in.

> In bhakti there is the essential element of rasa

And that right there is the sticking point no?  Squishy emotional bhakti 
versus rational abstract upasana.  But again I would like point out that 
the dividing line is arbitrary.  Bhakti can (and should) cause unceasing 
concentration on the Highest.  Upasana has its ecstatic aspect as I'm sure 
you're well aware.

The everything we would like to claim for our tradition is the means to 
moksha.  All these other things bhakti, upasana or whatever are only 
relevant in so far as they can lead to that goal.  Advaita Vedanta is a 
complete mokshashastra and it gives a yardstick for evaluating the claims 
of other practices.  Should they fail the evaluation then no we need not 
look at them except perhaps out of academic interest.
