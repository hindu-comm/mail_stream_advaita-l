The bhashya for BG. 7.23 and 9.23-24 seem relevant to Shri Satish-ji's
position. Your position is obviously the advaitin/siddAntin's position
in bhAShya for 9.25-26 when the Ishvara/bhAShyakAra says in 9.24 "ahaM
hi sarvayaGYAnAM bhokta cha prabhureva cha" but Shri Satish-ji's
position seems to have pramANa in the pUrvapaxin's position in these
verses when the bhAShya seems to confirm (as far as I understand) that
the devata-s (and hence the mantra-s) yield effect *independent* of
the sAdhaka's belief in Ishvaratva of the Lord.

There is even a pUrvapaxa between 9.24-25, "... The result of a
sacrifice is inevitable even for those who worship ignorantly out of
their devotion to other deities ..." which has close correspondence
with what Shri Satish-ji is saying that the result is dependent only
on the process and not on the sAdhaka's darshana point of view. The
Ishvara and the bhAShyakAra refute these positions saying that not
only are such other methods of finite result, but also are more
difficult. The worship of Ishvara is  "ananta-phalaM"/everlasting and
sukhArAdhanaM/easier as well  because of the Ashutoshitva of Ishvara:
"patraM-puShpaM-phalaM toyaM" in 9.26.

namaste
Ramakrishna
