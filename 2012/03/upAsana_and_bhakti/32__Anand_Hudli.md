that it will look un-related. However I intentionally leave it to those who
can grasp why this seemingly unrelated example is being given here.

I am not sure if I exactly get the point here. Are you saying one can be
just be devoted to some "force" (for lack of a better word) such as "giving
results quickly", "saving one when in trouble" and not conceive an actual
devatA with those characteristics? So one can practice the japa, homa,
tarpaNa, and brAhmaNa bhojana to "harness" the force.

This may be an approach for beginners and those who have no interest in
vedAnta, but such a view  does not find support in the gItA where it is
clearly stressed that all results of worship of deities, whether one
conceives them as forces of nature or not, comes from Ishvara alone. Please
see 7.20-7.2 -  starting with "kAmaistaistairhRtajnAnAH prapadyante
anyadevatAH" , "yo yo yAM yAm tanuM bhaktaH shraddhayA arcitumicchati", and
"... labhate ca tataH kAmAn mayaiva vihitAn hiitAn".

Also, the IshAvAsya upaniShad says, "IshAvAsyamidaM sarvam...", everything
is covered by Ishvara. There is nothing here that is not pervaded by
Ishvara.

>From the gItA, it is clear that whatever deity one worships, it is Ishvara
who really gives the results. The next verse "antavattu phalaM teShAM.."
makes it clear that we should not be focused on the results, since the
results themselves are short-lived. So what should be the focus? It is
should be Ishvara Himself.

So what I am trying to say is that whether one likes it or not, whether one
knows it or not, whether one cares to know it or not, results of all
upAsana come from the same Ishvara.

> Additionally one important point to note is that, there is no need for
the belief of an Ishvara when it comes to practice of mantra-s. A belief or
the lack of the same in an Ishvara does not have any effect on the results
that mantra-a give.

mantrin achieves same or similar results with the same mantra.

Please see what I wrote above.

Somethings are better appreciated when they are thought out by oneself as
opposed to someone logically explaining each and every detail. This is the
reason I had questions.. asking "What does this imply?" "Why did I bring
this scenario?". Additionally, it will save me some time, so that I do not
have to type too much.


>>4. Mantra Prayoga is also a ritual and whatever is said about Karma in

> Same comment as for 2. The practice of mantra-s and the ability to get
mantra-s to work does not require any belief in an Ishvara. But if one
subscribes to a particular darshana then there comes an interpretation or
one goes though thought process as to who gives the phala of mantra-s. Is
it Ishvara or is it something else etc etc. This mImAmsa and the conlcusion
coming from such an enquiry does not effect how or when a mantra gives
results.

Please see what I wrote above.


> Or somebody raises a stupid question constantly which goes like "If this
is not in scriptures, it is all useless". It is good to ask for a
scriptural reference on these matters. It is unfortunate to be able to not
recognize when and for what things to ask for a quote from scriptures and
when to infer something indirectly from scriptures.

For this we may refer to the exalted work called mahArtha manjari of
shrIman maheshvarAnanda - which says devatA lakShaNa is
"Ipsita-prasAdaktvaM & anIpsita-niShedhakatvaM" "giving those things which
the mantrin desires and avoiding those which the mantrin does noot like is
the nature of the devata".

Again we have to take this in the light of what the gItA says, as I said
above. These "effects" are really coming from Ishvara ultimately.

I will probably take up other points in a separate message.
