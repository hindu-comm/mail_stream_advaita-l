Namaste,

///The criticism of SankarAdvaita by other traditions is nindhanopasana like
Kamsa did to Krishna

//

Shri Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavih felt pity for those peoplewho couldn't understand
Sankara. He usesa beautiful term for them ie., *sisuH*. 

Brahmasri Samavedam Shanmukha Sarma explained this term *sisuH* saying that
all those philosophers who couldn't understand sankara hridaya are immature kids (sisuH). 
They need to grow old to understand Acharya Sankara.
