Sudhakarji - PraNAms 

Here are the steps to dismiss the reality to the plurality that is perceived- taking an example of gold ornaments piled up on the table. 

1. I see there are many gold ornaments on the table, each one distinctly different - ring, bangle, bracelet, etc. Each has its own attributes and utilities that distinguish it from the rest of them. All the gold ornaments are created from the same gold - Au.

2. I examine any one ornament closely - taking for example a ring. I see ring is nothing but gold. Every part of the ring is gold only - so I see it is gold in the form of the ring. Same goes with other ornaments.

3. If I further examine the ring, I see there is really no ring at all - All I see is gold in the form of a ring for which a name ring is given  - there is no separate ring other than gold. Hence what is there is gold alone.

4. Looking at all the ornaments - all I find is just gold only - but different names for different forms. There is no really any creation other than the names for the forms of gold. 

What was there was gold, what is there is gold and even if we melt all the forms what will be there is only gold. Creation is nothing but giving different names for forms of gold. If you ask gold why are existing in various forms It will answer - 1. It is my vibhuuti to be in various forms yet still remaining as gold. 2. I am taking these forms to satisfy the needs (vaasanaas) of the different people to satisfy their desires and be happy (until of course somebody steals these from them)

brahma arpanam - brahma haviH .. everything is nothing but brahman. The rest that one experiences is nothing but vibhuuti of Brahman expressing as Iswara. Where do I find Brahman - where do I find gold when I see only ring, bangle and bracelet. Hence Brahmaarpanam sloka by Lord Krishna.  

I do not have to melt ring to see gold. I can, looking at the ring, say that there is really no ring at all but gold only. That is viveka seeing the unchanging adhiShTaanam in the changing world of plurality. Since what counts is gold not the names and forms. That is a-dviata in spite of apparent dvaita. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

Hari Om!
