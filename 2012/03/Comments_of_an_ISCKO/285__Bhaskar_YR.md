There is no 'sAyujyam' in this.  The very word 'sAyujya' involves a 
two-entity pre-requisite where one 'joins' the other, yet the two entities 
 remaining in tact.  In Advaita there is only one Reality which is to be 
realized.

Yes, advaita teach us the one & only reality.  But shankara does talk 
mukti like sAyujya (not exactly as per dvaita) where as you mentioned 
above two entities remaining intact.  shankara talks about apAntaratama-s 
etc. in sUtra bhAshya where these mukta jeeva-s do come back to earth as 
per the instruction of parameshwara.  Can we say, this type of mukti 
jeeva-s (who are messengers of god) are not paramArtha jnAni, who does not 
have even an iota of individuality!!??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
