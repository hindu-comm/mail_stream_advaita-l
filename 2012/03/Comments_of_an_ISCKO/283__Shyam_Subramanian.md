Dear Sunilji,

I am sure the scholars in the list will be able to explain the difference
better. Whatever I understood from the bhAshyA and the
translations was that the sAlokya,sAmIpya,sArUpya and sAyujya all pertain
to saguNa brahman - hence sAyujya ("unifying with saguNa brahman" ?) cannot
be considered to be "brahmAtmanA saMsthitiH".

As regards Sayujya mukti let us consider the statement in the Ramayana,

Just curious, can you give me the source (kANDa, adhyAya, verse) for the
above statements/incidents in the vAlmIki rAmAyaNa ? I couldn't find the
word sAyujya mentioned in the rAmAyaNa at all.

Regards,
Shyam
