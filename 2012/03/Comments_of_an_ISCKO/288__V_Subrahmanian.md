Pl. note that I did not imply that.  Even while prarabdha is there the
jnani's advaita jnana is in tact.

Any sharIra that is required to do any vyApara is not without prakRti
sambandha.  We may debate whether it is bhautika or not but the point is
that it is prakRti only.

This is the rule for those who are destined to 'go' to kaivalya.  For those
jnani-s who are destined by Ishwara to take up one or the other cosmic
portfolios, there can be any number of sharIra-s.

Surely not.  That is what Shankara clarifies in the yAvadhikAra bhashya.
There is no difference in their jnAnam.  The difference is only in the
karma-upAsanA stock of the respective jnAnis.  It is because of the
extraordinary upAsana/karma stock of these jnani-s that Ishwara gives them
these posts.  It is something like a very accomplished/experienced
Professor is asked to do an extended service of three or five years even
after the normal retirement age of 60.  His special attainment is so great
that the institution wants to derive continued use of it for some more
time.
