Subbuji - PraNAms.

In the vishiShTaadvaita, the saayujya mukti involves everything what Sri Velukudi Krishnan swami said - except for two factors.
Jiiva is still anupramaanaat - only a part of the total body of Iswara. 
While he enjoys all the things mentioned except the creative power of the Iswara. Even though he is tiny he enjoys he infinite happiness that Iswara enjoyes.

In advaita Sujujyam means recognition of oneness - when we say pot space merges with the total space - or ring merges with gold - That is advaitic sayujya. It is an clear understanding that apparent duality is not reality but is mityaa only. That is suyujya in the sense the jiiva had the notion of separateness from jagat and Iswara. That dissolution of the notional division with the recognition of oneness is advaitic saayujya - in the same context that he becomes Brahman - not that he was separate from Brahman before. 

As long as one understands this, there should not be a problem since the very name a-dvaita indicates the negation of notional duality that is experienced. 

Hari Om!
