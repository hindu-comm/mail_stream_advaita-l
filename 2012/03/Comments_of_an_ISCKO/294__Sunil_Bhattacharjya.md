Namaste,

Probably your teacher wanted to say that considering several empty pots, when the pots are broken the space inside the pots loses the barriers and the seeming separation of the individual spaces disappear. When one considers the pots as permanent then there is likeness to the Visistdvaita. However if one considers the pots as not permanent then the situation is like Avaita. BTW, who was the teacher, in case you have the permission to divulge?

Regards,

Sunil KB

Namaste
In our study classes we were given an example on this context.
Consider a heap of beads, Advaita considers the heap as one entity butvishiShTaadvaitaconsider the bead as individual forming the heap. Essentially it is a viewpoint how you look at it. Basically both are same.

Subbuji - PraNAms.

In the vishiShTaadvaita, the saayujya mukti involves everything what Sri Velukudi Krishnan swami said - except for two factors.
Jiiva is still anupramaanaat - only a part of the total body of Iswara. 
While he enjoys all the things mentioned except the creative power of the Iswara. Even though he is tiny he enjoys he infinite happiness that Iswara enjoyes.

In advaita Sujujyam means recognition of oneness - when we say pot space merges with the total space - or ring merges with gold - That is advaitic sayujya. It is an clear understanding that apparent duality is not reality but is mityaa only. That is suyujya in the sense the jiiva had the notion of separateness from jagat and Iswara. That dissolution of the notional division with the recognition of oneness is advaitic saayujya - in the same context that he becomes Brahman - not that he was separate from Brahman before. 

As long as one understands this, there should not be a problem since the very name a-dvaita indicates the negation of notional duality that is experienced. 

Hari Om!
