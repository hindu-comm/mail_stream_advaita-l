Sankara says that those who dont accept the correct
(advaitic) interpretation of tat tvam asi are the meanest among scholars. I
even remember seeing the term mudha with respect to other traditions in his
works.  If you want to turn the audience mind to an issue, criticize
theopponent. It works like magic much better than logic. It is a powerful
tool but should be used very sparingly as otherwise you will be branded as
disrespectful and your words will lose value.
