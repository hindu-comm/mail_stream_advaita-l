(surrendering) implies duality, it is not possible otherwise. There is
nothing in the ShaDanga sharaNaagati that leads to non-duality. In
vishiShTAdvaita, jIva is utterly/completely dependent on the supreme being.
Yet, it is distinct.  In our mata -- advaita-vedAnta, brahman in
pAramArthika is not only advitIya it is also niShkala or partless. Latter
is important, as it removes the soul/body argument of vishiShTAdvaitins.

Another interesting thing (but tangential) to this thread is, sharaNagati
and bhakti or two different concepts. I understood this while studying Sri
nilakaNTha dIkShita's  AnandaSagaraStava. There is some degree of vagueness
in definition of what bhakti is. But sharaNagati as a process is not only
simple, it is unambiguous.
