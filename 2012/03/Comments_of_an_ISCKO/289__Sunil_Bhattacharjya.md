Namaste,

Saying that Sayujya involves two-entity-pre-requisite is like playing with words to mislead people. In Avidya there does exist the two entities but not when the Jnana dawns. Sayujya is the culmination of the yogic process by which the Jnani relizes the unitedness or the one-ness with Brahman. That is what sayujya means in advaita. Yogavasistha is very clear on this that without Yoga the body (tye five-koshas) cannot be got rid of. Even the Yoga-upanishad also supports this. 


The non-advaitins miserably fail to understand that without Jnana the ultimate one-ness cannot be realized. They forget that in the beginning the Brahman wanted to be many and that means in the beginning there were no entities like the Lord co-existing with him to give him company. What was at the beginning is also at the end and that is what"Akshara means. Thus at the end also the Brahman would not have any companion like himself. The non-advaitins are unable to realize this deficiency in their understanding.Let them remain happy with their understanding as they will have to take more births to understand the advaitic views.

Regards,

Sunil KB

Shankara says in that BSB 3.3.32 that the Jnana that destroys ajnAna
guarantees moksha that is unconditional. This 'messenger of God' state is
only temporary which will last till the prArabdha bhoga exists and once
that is exhausted there will be nothing that stands between this jnani and
kaivalya.:
