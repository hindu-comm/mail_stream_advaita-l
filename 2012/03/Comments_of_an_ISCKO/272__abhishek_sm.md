Recently, I read in an internet post written by a follower criticising
us advaitins. His post was like, "When Krshna asks arjuna and
consequently everyone to surrender to him in the Bhagawadgita, he's
directly telling us to surrender to him. Can someone surrender to
himself(pointing to advaitins)? Surrendering can be done between two
different beings only and not on one's self. Only "FOOLS" who cannot
understand the Bhagawadgita preach such things."

Of course abusing Gurus of other sampradayas is the trademark of
modern day ISCKON disciples anyway. Comments please.
