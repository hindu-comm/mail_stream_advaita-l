namaste,

Thanks to everyone for the very nice recent discussions on upAsana and bhakti.

I would like to know the difference between IshvarapraNidhAna of yoga
and karma-yoga of gItA.

The explanation in vyAsa and vAchaspati-mishra's explanation (in pages
139-142 of [1]) and the references to gitA and other texts therein
like:
-- yatkaroShi BG 9.27
-- aruroxormuneyogaM BG 6.3
-- bhoktAraM yaGYA tapasa  5.29
and other similar references seems to suggest a very close meaning
between these two.

namaste
