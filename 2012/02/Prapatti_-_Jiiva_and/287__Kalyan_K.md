Dear Sadanada-ji, There are a few points in your posts that I do not
understand. Is Ishwara, nothing but brahman with the limiting adjunct
of kAraNa SarIra? Or is this Ishwara in the state of yoga-nidra? What
does yoga-nidra mean for Ishwara? Is it the withdrawal of the cosmic
mind hiraNyagarbha? Can Ishwara know in the absence of hiraNyagarbha?
In purANas, hiraNyagarbha is identified with brahma and Ishwara is
vishNu. The sarvajNatva of vishNu does not depend on brahma. So
doesn't it follow that the sarvajNatva of Ishwara does not depend on
hiraNyagarbha? Further, Sruti says only the prajNa state as sarvajNa,
not the others. The idea of Ishwara's sarvajNatva being avyakta – I am
honestly hearing it for the first time. May I know any Sruti or Smriti
that supports this view point?

I apologize for posing so many questions. I tired to read your posts
very carefully and still found myself unable to grasp the full
meaning.


Regards

Kalyan
