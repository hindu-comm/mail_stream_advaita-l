Shree Rajaram - PraNAms 

There is no separate Iswara other than totality itself - Pure consciousness identified with totality is Iswara. Pure consciousness identified with locality is jiiva. micro and macro systems are in parallel - that is what discussed in Madukya in the three paadas. The study of that is required to appreciate these. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
