Bhakti is no doubt the driving force and it acts like in the examples given by Adi Sankara in that verse. Bhakti does help in the Sayujya Mukti of the Advaita too. Bhakti like the magnetic force takes the Bhakta to Bhagavan. However the question remains as to does the Bhakti, without the proper knowledge (the knowledge of Advaita), make the Bhakta one with the Bhagavan. Bhakti leads the Bhakta to the portals. At that stage, of course, an very ardent Bhakta can have the right Jnana through Lord's grace. Bhakti without Jnana cannot complete the job. All Bhaktas have their sankalpa depending on what they think they need from the Bhagavan, whether it is the nearness to the Lord or friendship with the lord or in any of the nine ways of bhakti mentioned in the Bhagavata purana.

Regards,

Sunil KB

What about this sloka of Sankara from Sivanandalahari?

अंकोलं निजबीजसंततिरयस्कांतोपलं सूचिका
साध्वी नैजविभुं लता क्षितिरुहं सिंधुस्रिसरिद्वल्लभम्
प्राप्नोतीह यथा तथा पशुपतेः पादारविंदद्वयम्
चेतोवृत्तिरुपेत्य तिष्टति सदा सा भक्तिरित्युच्यते।।
