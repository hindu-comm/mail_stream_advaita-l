Another 2 verses from the Bhaja Govindam.
गेयं गीता नाम सहस्रं ध्येयं श्रीपति रूपमजस्रम् . नेयं सज्जन सङ्गे
चित्तं देयं दीनजनाय च वित्तम् .. २७.. Regularly recite from the Gita,
meditate on Vishnu in your heart, and chant His thousand glories .
Take delight to be with the noble and the holy . Distribute your
wealth in charity to the poor and the needy.

भजगोविन्दं भजगोविन्दं
गोविन्दं भजमूढमते .
नामस्मरणादन्यमुपायं
नहि पश्यामो भवतरणे .. ३३..
Worship Govinda, worship
Govinda, worship Govinda, Oh
fool !
Other than chanting the Lord's
names, there is no other way
to cross the life's ocean.
