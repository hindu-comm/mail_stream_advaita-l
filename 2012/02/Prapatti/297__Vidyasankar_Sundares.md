In general, AcAryAnugraha can accomplish anything, if the AcArya has
the necessary guNa-s to make it so. But it so happens that one needs to
be a sat-pAtra for receiving such anugraha too and that is not always a
given.

It is anybody's guess whether a SrIvaishNava who goes through their
formal process of prapatti, merely as a pro forma observance because
it is a family practice, actually has vaikuNTha prApti or not after death. 

In the advaita tradition, the AcArya-s have generally not been in favor of 
encouraging things that people can mistakenly view as short-cuts. They
are usually careful to mention that sometimes something is said as an
arthavAda/stuti, in order to praise a particular practice that may aid in
drawing one's mind inwards or help in letting go of one's ego. moksha,
whether sadyaH or krama-vat, is generally not a thing for one person
to give away to another. An AcArya helps you at a crucial stage along
the krama or in imparting jnAna, but your moksha is yours to attain.
