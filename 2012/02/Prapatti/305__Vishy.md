Poojya Sadaji,

Thanks for immediate response, but however I feel you didn't answer my question...

Whatever be the path (A, VA, D, or even C or M) the truth should be one, Isn't it?
When you surrender (via bhakthi marga) / drop (thru Jnana) your ego completely
what else?? Mukti is right Now and Here, right?

than , can I say, rest are all stories made up by mind as ego is also a mind stuff!!!


pranams
viswanath

Viswanathji - PraNAms

I was only giving the VishiShTaadvaita position. If you are a VishiShTaadvaitin, you would not have the questions you posed. In the purushashuuktam purusha is identified as the husband of Lakshmi and she stays close to him all the time - day and night. The followers are also called srivaishnavates - sri comes first - When you go to vaikunta you are first taken by the mother who ready to embrace you however dirty you look because it is mother's love. She will wash you up and make you presentable to greet the father- Lord Narayana. Hence it is easier to approach the father via the mother who ignores all the defects out of her love and washes them out to make you perfect. 

Vishvaksena is the army officer or the security head and makes sure you are OK to enter the abode of the Lord - By the by vaishavates pray Vishvaksena not Ganesha before any religions function when they do aavaahana of the Lord. As per VA the size of jiiva is anupramaana - and the jiivas and the jagat form His virat swaruupa - as shown in the 11th ch. of Gita. 

From the advaita point any hierarchy is at the metal purification level of the jiivas and all in vyvahaara. The absolute truth is only one - sat chit ananda swaruupa.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
