prapatti is not any kind of mukti at all.  Think about it.  Mukti means 
liberation.  If you are dependent on any other person even Ishvara, how 
can you consider yourself liberated?

The smarta view is that everyone has "qualifications" (adhikara) of 
somewhat.  That Shruti talks about agnihotra etc. is because these are 
archetypes for karma not literally the only karmas themselves.  Surrender 
to the Lord only means one should leave the consequences of ones karma in 
His hands.  It is not an excuse for laziness.
