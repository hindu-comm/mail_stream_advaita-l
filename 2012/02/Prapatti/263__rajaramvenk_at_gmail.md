But Ishwara is our own Inner Self. It is not that we are depending on someone else.  Just that He manifests in front of us in a form that is blissful to us. Even if He appears to be different, it is just like a wife depending on her husband or children on parents. So, what is wrong? We are anyway dependent on His anugraha for moksha (advaita siddhi). 

Why go a state where we will lose the blissful experience with Him?

prapatti is not any kind of mukti at all.  Think about it.  Mukti means 
liberation.  If you are dependent on any other person even Ishvara, how 
can you consider yourself liberated?

The smarta view is that everyone has "qualifications" (adhikara) of 
somewhat.  That Shruti talks about agnihotra etc. is because these are 
archetypes for karma not literally the only karmas themselves.  Surrender 
to the Lord only means one should leave the consequences of ones karma in 
His hands.  It is not an excuse for laziness.
