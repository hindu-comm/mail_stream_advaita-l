Namaste,

Several Rg Veda Suktas are in line with prapatti tattva as they extoll vedic devatAs.

For that matter, in Durga Sukta, the mantra "durgAM devIM sharaNa mahaM prapadyE sutarasitarasE namaH" propounds prapatti only.

So, prapatti is inherent in shruti (in general) and sUkta bhAga (in particular). 

regs,
sriram
