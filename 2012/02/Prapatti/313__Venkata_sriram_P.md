Pujya Sadaji,

A side note:

////

In the purushashuuktam purusha is identified as the husband of 
Lakshmi and she stays close to him all the time - day and night. 
The followers are also called srivaishnavates - sri comes first - 
When you go to vaikunta you are first taken by the mother who ready to 
embrace you however dirty you look because it is mother's love. 

///

Probably the above interpretation is from V.Advaita perspective.

For the yajna puruSa, "hri" & "sri" are the wives where these two are to be understood in terms of karma ordained by shruti as :

Sri - the yajna phala as brahmatejas & chittashuddhi from the observance of nitya / naimittika karmas;

hri - the lajja (sense of guilt) and staying away ie., abstinence from performing niSiddha karma 

regs,
sriram
