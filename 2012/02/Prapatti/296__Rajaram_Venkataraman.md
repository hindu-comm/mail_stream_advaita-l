I cross checked Sri Vidyaranya's dig vijayam. By virtue of of being a
jnani's mother, she was eligible for mukti. But her mind did not get
attracted to nirguna Brahman, which is what Sankara tried to impress upon
her first. She also did not like to to Siva loka because the kinkaras were
scary looking :) And wanted to go to Vishnu loka, which Sankara arranged
for her.

To me this shows that vaikuntha prapti is possible through acharya anugraha
in Advaita. Is it not? So prappatti is a valid process?

By sannyasa, I meant real vairagya.
