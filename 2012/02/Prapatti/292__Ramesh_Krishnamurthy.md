One who wants to go to kailAsa or vaikuNTha is not ready for
advaita-vedAnta. Only one who is interested in mukti here and now, by
owning up to one's status as nitya-shuddha-buddha-mukta, is a worthy
student of advaita.

krama-mukti etc are discussed in the shAstra but they are not central to
advaita-vedAnta. Certain kinds of saguNopAsana are often taught to
sAdhaka-s but the primary purpose is chittashuddhi and
sAdhana-chatuShTaya-saMpatti, and not going to kailAsa or vaikuNTha.

Nonetheless, if someone is particularly interested in going to vaikuNTha, a
saMpradAyavid AchArya is likely to advise him/her to concentrate on
saguNopAsana and not bother with the j~nAna mArga.
