 Rajaram: In advaita, the Self cannot be said to know the infinite
attributes superimposed on it through Maya, right? Krama mukti is more
interesting because the self gets to know the infinite atttributes in
brahmaloka. I am not suggesting doing nothing but finding the easiest path
to bliss. The path of jivan-muktiis hard and it does satisfy the curiosity
to know the infinite attributes of the lord.
