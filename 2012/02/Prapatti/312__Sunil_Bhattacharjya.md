The Lord has mentioned Veda and Vedanta separately in the Bhagavad Gita and we should not lose sight of that as they have somewhat different perspectives.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Prapatti

Namaste,

Several Rg Veda Suktas are in line with prapatti tattva as they extoll vedic devatAs.

For that matter, in Durga Sukta, the mantra "durgAM devIM sharaNa mahaM prapadyE sutarasitarasE namaH" propounds prapatti only.

So, prapatti is inherent in shruti (in general) and sUkta bhAga (in particular). 

regs,
sriram
