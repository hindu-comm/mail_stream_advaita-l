Rajaram: But jivan mukti is attained only by a rare few. It is hard to
attain and avidya lesha is not removable until death. And more importantly
a jivan mukta loses the opportunity to experience the auspicious qualities
of Hari and pure bhakti after death. In Krama Mukti, one attains both
saguna and nirguna brahman. So, it seems more desirable.

Is it attained through siddhi in one of the brahma-vidyas? I thought the
Lord says it is attained through antima smarana and bhagavat smarana (rf.
bg verse man mana).

Does advaita tradition admit the scriptural validity of prapatti marga of
sri vaishnavas to attain brahmaloka (vaikuntha prapti) or considers it
bogus?
