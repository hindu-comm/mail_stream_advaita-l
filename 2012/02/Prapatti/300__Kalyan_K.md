I thought that in krama mukti, one goes to the either satya loka, vaikuNTha
or kailAsa, depending on who one's ishTa devata is. Some posters on this
thread have also expressed similar opinion. Is this incorrect?

Many people (including smArtas) recite the "srI venkateSwara prapatti"
without knowing any of the details of VA philosophy. Some of these reciters
might be believers in advaita too. Would these advaitins be denied entry
into vaikuNTa because of their status as advaitins?
