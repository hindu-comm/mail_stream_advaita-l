Namaste,

When one goes to the University level one had already undergone the college level and the school level courses. It is like this. The Advaitins enjoy every level except that their goal is set high at the ultimate level. The Advaitins know from the Upanishad that the Brahman is Akshara. What is at the beginning is also at the end and the sage Vasistha explains this to Lord Ram. The Lord wanted to be many and so came the creation. Creation is a temporary phase. The bodied state is not the state of the ultimate mukti and a true jnani has to aspire for the bodiless state, as Vasistha advised to contemplete on the bodiless state. Unfortunately the Dvaitins and the Visistdvaitins ave yet to come up to the level of an advaitin to understand that. As Ramakrishna Paramhansa said it it is only the matter of level. All are aspirants at their own levels. The advaitins being at the higher level can see all the levels below theirs but that is not the case with the
 non-advaitins. It takes time for the lower level aspirants to come upto the higher level. For a child to be born it takes nine months and odd days. So also any non-advaitin would not understand this overnight however much he or she may try. So the non-advaitins need not get depressed and feel envious of the advaitins, who aspire for the ultimate state in keeping with the proper understanding of the Vedanta. It may be true that the higher level is not crowded as are the portals of the higher education. The non-advaitin would, of course, go on trying ot belittle the advaitins and the advaitins should ignore them and leave them alone. They (the non-advaitins) will need time to abandon their thinking and till then they may be even continue to use vituperative language against the advaitins. Did not the early Madhvites call Adi Sankaracharya a demon trying to destroy the craetion?

Regards,

Sunil KB

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Prapatti

Rajaram PraNAms - Your declarative statements prompted me to respond. 

Mukti as per advaita is not some thing to attain since you are ever liberated. Mukti that comes can go away too. Please refer to Goudapaadas alaati shanti prakaraNa. In VishiShTaadvaita, yes you go to vaikunTa since the all pervading Lord is in VaikunTa -a logical contradiction.

In krama mukti - you can go only upto Brahman loka - there you need to go through the same vedantic study under the guidance of Brahmaji who takes classes once in 32 years (I assume Brahmaji's years). I suggest it is better to go through the Vedantic shravana manana and nidhidhyaasana here itself than post pone to later. 

Prapaati as per advaita is surrendering completely the ego and that happens only with the knowledge that it is false. false can be falsified by the knowledge that it is false and any other method will only make it more real than false. Surrendering can only occur once and we cannot repeatedly surrender. tanu mana dhana subkuch terahai - can be said only once; and once given to Him we cannot give it again the next day during aarati. The other surrendering is just naamkevaste surrender. Hence knowledge alone gives liberation and Krishna says Jnaani is the supreme bhakta. Therefore bhkati - jnaanam - prapatti - renunciation that is said in tyaagenaike amRitatvam - all are essentially the same - the recognition that I am nitya mukta swaruupaH. Nothing to attain but something to understand of my true nature in clear terms where I surrender (prappatti) of my false identifications. Personally I have no interest to study Vedanta in Brahma loka - happy to do that
here. 

About siddhis - I have many already. I can fold my hands, blink my eyes, eat delicious food and convert that into garbage, I can talk, listen, smell, taste - oh! what a wonder - a bunch of minerals, carbohydrates and inert matter can do all that! Even experiences the pain in my back! What more siddhis I need. Just marvel at the vibhuutis of the Lord, nay of my own vibhuuties right here and right now. Ah! I can even express the thoughts in writing and typing with all spelling mistakes making others also wonder. What more siddhis I need to prove myself!


Hari Om!
