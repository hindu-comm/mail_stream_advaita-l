Dears
I think it is wrong to brush aside the descriptions of 
Vaikuntha,Nithyasuries,Viraja Nadhi-not Sarayu-that are found in our Divya 
Prabandha`s as some imaginary work of our realised souls.According to me 
these should be real but not in the sense we judge what is real in this 
world.If bhakthi is there faith will result and faith will lead to realise 
these domains.In all scriptures Heaven,Hell are all fully described and as a 
jiva we cannot imagine what they are except through the eyes of the realised 
souls.So I feel it is not correct to discount these descriptions and descend 
to the level of atheists whose first reaction is to ridicule these 
doctrines.R.Krishnamoorthy.
