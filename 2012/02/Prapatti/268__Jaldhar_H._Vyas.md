You can have prArthanA without prapatti.  According to your explanation, 
it means the feeling that "I am incapable of action so God, you take 
over."  I don't see why that is necessary in order to offer namaskaras. 
The Advaita prayer would be "I am trying to find you and know you God, may 
you help me be successful."

To go to Vishnu means to "know His infinite attributes" as you said and to 
know that these are the attributes of your own self.  It is not sitting 
around waiting for Him to do it for you.
