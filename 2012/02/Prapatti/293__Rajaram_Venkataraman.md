Only a true sannyasi can attain that status of a jivan mukta. Otherwise, it
is only a self deception. I am not opposed to intellectually understanding
Advaitam but realisation is only for one who has truly transcended all
desires. Even such atma rama Jnanis, Bhagavatam says, are attracted to the
super-excellent qualities of Hari. Madhusudana, a jivan mukta and a
paramahamsa sannyasi, says "let those who have truly controlled the mind
meditate on the white light (nirguna brahman) if they want. for us, who are
devoted, let the blue light that runs here and there in vrindavan be
forever the object of vision and goal"

 I am aware of that but it is difficult. Adi Sankara, as Sri Subrahmanian
pointed out, transported his mother to Sri Vaikuntham. She rejected jivan
mukti and kailasha prapti as not fit for her. This is akin to prappatti. I
wanted to know if there is a valid Vedic ritual for saranagati.
