Not in vishishtadvaita.  Advaita understanding of kramamukti on the other 
hand depends on Ishvara being our own inner self.

Is God within us or in front of us?

What is wrong is it is not oneness so it is incomplete understanding of 
the truth.

No, what we want from God, or Guru, or shastra is the removal of 
ignorance.  Moksha is something which is of the self.

Bliss belongs to Brahman.  The biggest misunderstanding the theists have 
with the Advaita understanding of mukti is that it involves giving things 
up.  But what it really is is to become purNa -- whole, entire, complete. 
You will still have the bliss of Ishvara in mukti plus more.
