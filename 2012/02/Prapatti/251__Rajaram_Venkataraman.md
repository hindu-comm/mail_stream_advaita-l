The simplest process to achieve krama mukti seems to be that of Sri
Vaishnavas. You admit that you dont have any qualifications whatsoever and
perform saranagati. And on acceptance of this by an acharya in the
line, you are assured of being transported to Vaikuntha at the end of
life. That simple. Is there an equivalent in advaita tradition to go to
Vaikuntha, Sivaloka etc.? I was told that upanayanam or nama sankirtanam is
enough but also here that it is not and one has to perform rigorous
sadhana. What is the tradition's view on this?
