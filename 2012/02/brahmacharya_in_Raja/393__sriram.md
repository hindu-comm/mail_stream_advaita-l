Dear
It is correct to say that Brahmacharya  means searching for Brahman 
always.Brahman is unknown but knowable.Brahmacharyam came to be associated 
with celibacy as this state helps one undisturbed to pursue the 
goal.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Subject: [Advaita-l] brahmacharya in Raja yoga abhyAsa and advaita anushtAna


> Respected members,
>
> Recently a locally renowned yoga teacher made  a statement during his
> lecture that in the *abhyAsa *of Patanjali's yoga sutra aphorisms, *
> brahmacharya* is only the  "hopeful attitude to see Brahman everywhere or
> walk in the world with the knowledge/attitude that everything is Brahman"
> and not the traditional interpretation of celibacy.
>
> It was intriguing to hear that from him as he is known to advocate VyAsA's
> bhAshya of Yoga Sutra for his yoga training and introspection. Assuming
> this was the same VyAsA of *Brahma sutrAs*, my limited understanding of
> this term from observing yathi-s of advaitic, v. advaitic and dvaitic 
> mutts
> is quite different.
>
> Does the definition of Brahmacharya change with the sadhana mArga?   How 
> do
> the sutrakArA-s treat the necessity of *brahmacharya* in the* *sAdhana in
> advaitic path? How do they define or expect the understanding of "*
> brahmacharya*"?
>
> It is obvious if advaitic sAdhana is recommended to and practiced by
> sanyaasis and those who choose not to enter grihastAshrama. But  for a 
> long
> time, advise and guidelines for advaitic practice have become common
> commodity discussed by various 'missions' , authors and self-declared
> advaitins who charmingly advocate the sAdhana in advaitic principles to
> everyone including all types of non-brahmachAris.
>
> In this situation, how should an aspirant or a wannabe-aspirant / student
> of advaita understand this requirement?
>
> My humble request is not to make this question an academic debate point in
> the list.
