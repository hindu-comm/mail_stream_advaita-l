Hari Om, Gopalji,

Across many commentaries/ translations, especially by Advaiti teachers,
brahmacarya is interpreted as being in brahman. However, in PYS,
brahmacarya being included in the basic a~Nga, even after discounting the
fact that PYS has a dualistic ending, it has to necessarily be interpreted
as celibacy. One who is in brahma needs no sAdhana otherwise, let alone
AsanA onwards.

As Vidyasankarji said, not following brahmacarya is giving into
dehAtmabuddhi, the grossest of all forms. With subtlest of the subtlest as
the goal, one can't be indulging in the grossest of all expressions. IMHO,
its improper to use the loaded meaning of brahmacarya in PYS, all the more
so because its still bahira~Nga, pre-pratyAhAra.
