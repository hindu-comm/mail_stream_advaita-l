Dear Murtyji,

///

I think Rutu Kala is 16 days from first day of monthly course but
first 3 days are not suitable. Others can clarify.

//

Let us refrain from discussing embarrassing mails. People here areaware of "grihastha dharma". 

Infact, if one knows the true purport of the meaning of sloka "kAyEna vAchA manasEndriyairva.........karOmi yadyat sakalaM parasmai nArAyaNAyEti samarpayAmi",
the issue boils down.

We have much more refined topics to dicuss rather than getting obsessed with maithuna.

regs,
sriram
