Namaste

But Sex is not always cause for losing Brahmacharya.  A careful
Gruhastha can keep his Brahmacharya even after marriage.

If a man has sex with his wife in her Rutu Kala there is no loss of
Brahmacharya. If he goes to her outside Rutu Kala Bramhacharya is
lost.

I think Rutu Kala is 16 days from first day of monthly course but
first 3 days are not suitable. Others can clarify.

If a Gruhastha is going to his wife only in Rutu Kala always he will
remain Brahmachari ALWAYS. No loss of Brahmcharya.

If he does unnatural act with or without spouse and discharges
anywhere outside female organ Brahmacharya is lost.  Artificial
devices for birth control is prohibited.

Some people say he cannot go to his wife in days like Sraddha days of
elders and Amavasya and Sivaratri days. It is prohibited.

He must approach his wife only in the night not day time or evening.

Proper Sex is like doing Vajapeya Yajna because in Brudaranyaka
Upanishad 6-4-3 there is a praise of woman's organ of procreation and
the man who practices sex knowing this gets the result equal to
Vajapeya Yajna.  The female organ is like the Yajna Kunda with fire
and he offers the Seed into it.
