Dear members,

I looked at Sri Adi Sankara's bhashya on Vishnu sahasranama and it starts
with commentary on - Shri vaisampAyana uvAcha - SrutvA dharmA na sesheNa
etc.

But the vishnu sahasranAma that we recite today starts with Shukla
aMbaradharaM Vishnum and it has a few more verses like vyAsAya vishNu
rUpAya etc.

Are these verses shuklambaradharam vishnum and vyasaya vishnu rupaya etc.
(that Sankara has not commented on) present in the mahabharata? If not,
where are they found?

Regards
Kalyan
