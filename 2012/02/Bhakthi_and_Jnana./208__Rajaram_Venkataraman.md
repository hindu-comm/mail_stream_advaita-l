The use of bhakti as an essential aid to jnana is easy to establish using
the upanishads. It is a matter of sitting with a traditional scholar and
getting a knowledge dump. Here is a sample

yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha-deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakashante mahatmanah (Sv. Up. 6.38)

The challenge will be in establishing bhakti rasa but not impossible (rf.
Sri Sriram Venkat post on raso vai sa:).
