Namaste,

///
All Dvijas have to meditate on Savitru Deva the Sun God every day

//

The upAsya tattva is Aditya maNDalAntargata hiraNmaya puruSa. Now, the choice is ours whether it is viSnu / shiva. 

Sankara Bhagavatpada in "praSnOttara ratnamAlika" instructs as:

Q) kO brAhmaNaiH upAsyO ?
A) gAyatry-arka-agni gOchara shambhuH 

English Transl: Q) Whom should a brAhmaNa worship?
A) The Sivain gAyatri, Sun & Fire 


Q) gAyatryAmAdityE cha agnE shaMbhau cha kiM nu ?
A) TATTVAM

Engl: Q) What is in gAyatri, Aditya, Agni & Shambhu?
 Ans ) The Tattva 


/////

The Mantra is telling us wise people are calling the Sat by different names 

//

The translation for the word "vipra" has been used very loosely. "vEda pATEna vipratvaM" 
is the vyutpatti. 

///

When we do Upasana of Surya it is the best approximation for Brahmopasana.

//

Yes. Partially true. But is one among the aSTa mUrtis. Sankara in Dakshinamurty Stotra
says "bhUraMbhAsya-analaO-anilO.....". The constant upAsana and reflection on
this 8 murties would lead to "ahaMgrahOpAsana" that leads to Advaita Siddhi.

///

Sun Light is like Nirguna Brahman. Sun light shows us all objects and
colours and shapes. But that Sun Light has no shape and colour. It is
simply brightness. Pure Light. 100% Sat.
//

This isa poor comparision for nirguNa. 

As far as aditya upAsana is concerned, worshipping Him with aruNa praShna, 
saura mantra pATa and trichArghya pradhAna are prescribed. Apart from these,
there are secret vidyAs which are learnt from a competent teacher. Couple of them
are "akSi puruSa vidya" and "jyOtir vidyA" of maNDala brAhmaNa upaniSad. 
Both the vidyAs are antarAditya upAsanAs which pave the sAdhana towards
liberation.

Sriram
