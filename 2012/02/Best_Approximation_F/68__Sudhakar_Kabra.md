Namaste

In Advaita we believe it is difficult to meditate on Nirguna Brahman
without attributes but it is easier to meditate on Saguna Brahman with
attributes. Some think the Saguna Brahman is Vishnu some think it is
Siva some think it is Ganesha some think it is Sakti. But the best
approximation is Surya our Sun God. Why? All Dvijas have to meditate
on Savitru Deva the Sun God every day in Sandhyavandana with the Most
Sacred Mantra of all Mantras, the Gayatri. This Gayatri Mantra is
about Surya only.

>Be careful with the examples you give. all examples given have some flaws but are approximated to be the best fit. This example stands no where.

Vedas are saying Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti. There is only One
Sat. This is Brahman. But wise people are calling it by different
names.
>All the naam rupa in advaitic parlance comes under maayik and it is not termed Brahman. The meaning is since sat can not be defined precisely, wise come to closest approximation by speaking differently. One can never say: This is Brahman.

But what is this Sat Mantra of the Vedas? It is a Surya Mantra
only.
> can you give some reference for above statement.
It is used for Surya Upasana. The Mantra is telling us wise
people are calling the Sat by different names but that Sat is Surya.
None other than Surya is Sat.
When we do Upasana of Surya it is the best approximation for Brahmopasana.

>Surya in mythology is generally considered as a devata.How is it the bet approximation.

Surya is also visible to us. If someone asks show me where is Vishnu
where is Siva where is Ganesha what will you show? But we can show
Surya and say He is our Brahman.
>Brahman cannot be shown, it is beyond pratyaksha, since it is the primary subject. The moment you show, it becomes an object and is no longer a Brahman.

We can convince anyone without Sun we
cannot be living on Earth. The Sun is supporting us all the time. He
is also giving us Solar Energy. This is more environmentally friendly
than using petrol and making the disgusting Islamic countries rich.

Sun Light is like Nirguna Brahman.
>Sun light has a source being Sun. What is the source of Nirguna Brahman you are equating to?

Sun light shows us all objects and
colours and shapes. But that Sun Light has no shape and colour. It is
simply brightness. Pure Light. 100% Sat.
