How? The Gayatri Mantra is directly telling 'Tat Savituhu'. The Name
Savita of Surya is directly in the Mantra. We cannot argue and say it
is not Surya but Vishnu or Siva. It is wrong.

The Vyasa Smruti is saying-
Vishwamitra Rishishchando Nicrudgayatramucyate |
Devata Paramatma Va Savita Va Prakirtitaha ||

There is no doubt the Devata of the Gayatri Mantra is Surya or Savita.
We have to worship Him with the Gayatri Mantra.

Taittiriya Sruti is saying Sa Yashcayam Purushe | Yashcasavaditye | Sa Ekaha |
When we meditate on Surya we have to think the Brahman in us Purusha
and in Aditya is the same. Then we realize Brahman.

Gayatri Meditation on Surya is the best way to realize Brahman.

That is why in Sandhyavandana we have to say Asavadityo Brahma
Brahmaivasmi. The Surya is Brahman. I am Brahman.

The Vaishnavas are saying Asavadityo Brahma but they are leaving
Brahmaivasmi. They are making a serious mistake.
