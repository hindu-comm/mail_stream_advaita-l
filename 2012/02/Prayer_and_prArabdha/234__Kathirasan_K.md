Namaste Sriramji,

In tha jataka vidya (horoscope reading), prarabdha karma is measured in the
following three categories:

1. drdha karma - strong karmas
2. adrdha karma - weak karmas
3. drdha-adrdha karma - middling karma

It is believed that our self effort can only avert the 2nd and 3rd type of
karmas but not the 1st one. Hence, what swamiji mentioned could possibly
refer to the 1st type. Or unless one is explicitly confining the definition
of prarabdha karma to be the 1st type only.
