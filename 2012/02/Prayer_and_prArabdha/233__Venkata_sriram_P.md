Dear Members,

I was listening to the Bhagavat Gita discourse by Shri Paripoornananda Saraswati
of Sripeetam, Kakinada. While explaining the karma yoga, swamiji said that none can escape the bhoga of prArabdha karma phala. 

Even if one does prarthana / mantra japa / navagraha japas etc., prarabdha karma phala has to be experienced. There is no escape. 

I would like to know, how far the above statement is true. 

sriram
