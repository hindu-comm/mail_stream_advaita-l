Namaste

Prarabdha is like Momentum in Physics. A wheel is pushed and it will
be rolling. It will not stop on its own.

BUT a Force can be applied to cancel the Momentum.

To stop Prarabdha we have to apply a Force. What is the Force?

Example 1 Markandeya's Prarabdha was saying he will die at 16 years.
But he prayed to Siva . Siva came and drove away Yama. Markandeya did
not die. The Force is Siva.

Example 2 Satyavan's Prarabdha was he will die after marriage. But his
wife Savitri rescued him.

Like this there are many examples in Puranas. It is difficult to
escape Prarabdha. But not Impossible.
