I would like to know, how far the above statement is true.  

praNAms
Hare Krishna

This is very much true atleast in some part of the advaita circle :-)) For 
that matter, according to 'prachalita' advaita siddhAnta, even paramArtha 
jnAni also cannot escape this prArabdha karma till he is there in his 
physical body & his continuation in his body is due to this prArabdha :-)) 
 As per some vedAntins, avidyA lesha in the jnAni is due to this 
prArabdha.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
