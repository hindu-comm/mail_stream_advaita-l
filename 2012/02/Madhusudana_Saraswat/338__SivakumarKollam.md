Thanks for your pertinent observations.As I already clarified most of the
issued aroused by the academic community are  worthless from an asthika
point
of view. Many are quite blunders.But we still have to
support them all because it is million dollar business
providing livelihood for millions.Hence our most kind Acharyas support it
with a word of caution *sabdajaalam
mahaaranyam chittavibhrama kaaranam.*
