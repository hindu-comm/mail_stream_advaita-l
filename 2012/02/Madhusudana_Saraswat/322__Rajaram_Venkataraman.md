I am very selfish in the sense that I discuss only when I learn something.
So, please dont be disappointed if I dont respond. I will briefly answer
your points (nothing new). I leave you to draw your conclusions.

Rajaram: I dont think Madhusudana is from Bengal. That conclusion by
scholars is primarily based on stories - not any literary evidence. There
is one scholar (apart from me - just kidding :)) who concluded likewise.

Rajaram: Please tell me what works of Nelson you have read on Madhusudana.
Your post on Nelson is a ditto copy of mine on Jan 29 - the opening post of
the thread titled "Did Madhusudana reconcile ...?".

Rajaram: According to Dr. Sanjukta Advaita Siddhi is most probably before
BhR and she has given reasons for that. My point is totally misunderstood
by you. Even if you can prove Advaita Siddhi was later than BhR, you cannot
prove Gudartha Dipika is later than BhR. Gudartha Dipika says clearly
establishes the position of bhakti and BhR.

Rajaram: You say that he stole ideas from gaudiya vaishnavism without
giving credit to the latter. If you are right, then I have to say he was
not an honest person. Needless to say, I think he was honest :)
