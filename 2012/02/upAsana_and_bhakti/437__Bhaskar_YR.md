All sha~Nkara does is to broadly define
upAsana in terms of focusing one's thought on a particular object. But
there is nothing to suggest that such an object must be a deity with whom
one has an intense personal relationship. In fact, the object can very 
well
be a mantra, yantra, breath, etc.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

But this object (Alambana/prateeka) should be chosen as per the 
prescription of shAstra insists shankara in chAndOgya shruti bhAshya (in 
introduction?? not sure).  Alambana-s like hrudayAkAsha, prANa, OmkAra 
etc. have been recommended by shruti and one should treat this Alambana as 
parameshwara (or svarUpa ) only.  yOnyAm devatAmupAstenyOsAvanyOhamasmeeti 
na sa veda yathA pashurevaM sa devAnAm, asserts shruti.    By doing 
upAsana like this shankara says would help the jnAnOtpatti.  And even 
prateekOpAsana also should be done as per shAstra vihita vidhi...It is not 
anyway one's choice of his own atleast as per advaita sAdhana.  Relevant 
discussions can be found in 4th adhyAya of brahma sUtra. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
