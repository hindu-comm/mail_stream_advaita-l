Namaste,

To know what one plus two makes one need not go to a Nobel-laureate and it is okay if one just asks a school-boy. So also to know the difference between Bhakti and Upasana do we need to to go so deep and search all the different statements? Bhakti is the love and devotion with respect and Upasana is the worship of the loved and respected one by the devotee. The bhakta does the upasana of the Bhagavan. That is enough for comprehension. A stage comes to a Jnani when he or she does not need any shastra and the comprehension alone suffices.


Regards,

Sunil KB

You are completely off the track by quoting this unrelated text.

This again proves your complete misunderstanding of what I have said. I am

You are again wrong. I have not based my position on bhakti traditions.
It is a pity you could not even identify what I am discussing.

I would have appreciated your lengthy response if it had contained even a
bit of Vedanta as taught by Shankara. It is this we are discussing and
bringing in everything unrelated to Vedanta is simply a waste of time of
the members of this List.
