Dear Sri Ravishankar
My view is Upasana seeks worldly objectives -and mainly by 
artharthies.Upasana slowly will elevate the upasaka to be  a Bhakthiman in 
which stage he will come to realise that these worldly pleasures and assets 
are meaningless .Taking refuge in the deity/self only will lead to 
liberation meaning no more births/samsara.So upasana is also a step in the 
Bhakthi marg.R.Krishnamoorthy.
