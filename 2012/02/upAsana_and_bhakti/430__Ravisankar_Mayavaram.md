This definition of bhakti as flow of similar ideas, allows bhakti to
be even "parama dveSha ruupaa".  Can any flow of similar ideas be
called bhakti? Or  it has to be something like "sva svaruupa
anusandhana"  or something that has the form of prema?

Not necessarily. They can be done with the desire for a specific phala
 as a goal. In that sense, a mantra, tantra, yantra prayoga can be
done accurately but without "prema" as (bhakti as parama prema
ruupaa).  They need not accompany or have the purpose of having flow
of similar ideas as it goal or even a by product. Depending on the
prayoga, performer may not  even desire for mental or physical
proximity with the devata. I think such prayogas are karma and not
upAsana.    Both upAsana and bhakti do not come under the category of
karma.
