It seems to me that everyone on this thread associates different meanings
with the words upAsana and bhakti. When talking of how upAsana = bhakti
in a generic sense in advaita literature and how bhakti = jnAna in a specific
author's works, it would be best to clarify what one means by these terms
and what influences one's understanding of these terms.
