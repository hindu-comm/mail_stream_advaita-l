Dear Sivakumar, I would like to avoid the gross mistake. Is there any traditional scholar who has cared to study Madhusudana Saraswati? Prof. Lance Nelson, Prof. Sanjukta, Prof. Mishra etc. spent a lifetime doing that. They have sat at the feet of traditional scholars and documented the unanswered questions.

It is a gross mistake to asses the traditional
works by  norms of western academicians
and unfortunately this is the task in which most
of the present day academic scholars indulge in.This is because most of the
works on Adwaita and bhakthi literature is concerned with the subjective
aspect ie.self which cannot be assessed from an objective aspect which is
the approach of the academicians.Lack of understanding of this  seems to be
the root cause of most of  problem related to study of
Adwaita and Bhakthi. Most interesting fact is that despite the caution and
advise of our Acharyas time to time we again and again indulge in same
mistake!
