Sorry for previous haste reply.

Explaining a few words in a way other than that of sha~Nkara doesn't prove
madhusUdana opposed to him as long as he is committed to non-duality. And
supporting bhakti in bhakti-texts is not such a conflict. Now my position
is clear and repetition is useless. So, I retire.
