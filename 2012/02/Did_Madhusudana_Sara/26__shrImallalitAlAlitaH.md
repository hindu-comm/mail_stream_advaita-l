You are generalizing things. Neutrality is not unique to academicians and
bias is also not unique to saMpradAyavit-s. This is causing uneasiness for
many here.

You know that I didn't say anything about madhusUdana's view.

This is what I said :

Traditional scholars know the limit and scope of each book. They don't
mingle things to create a new theory which can not stand tests.

I said that every work of a writer has a limit. When a person like
madhusUdana starts to write a treatise on bhakti, he goes to elaborate it
up to a level where it seems to be greater than anything else.
Actually, greatness of any type of popular bhakti is a baseless thing. It
has no bases in veda-s itself. Let Agama-s and purANa-s say anything. We
don't care that much about them. They are acceptable when not in conflict
with veda-s and yukti.

bhakti as defined by shrI-sha~Nkara in vivekachUDAmaNi is one of the types
of bhakti accepted by madhusUdana. This is just re-branding of GYAnam. We
accept that such bhakti is same as GYAnam and not greater and better than
that.
Other types of bhakti-s are special types of rasa originating from
shravaNa, kIrttana, etc. They are definitely limited in their scope. They
can't be said higher and better than GYAna.
This is what members tried to tell you in a previous threads.
