Have you studied Madhusudana under a traditional scholar? What makes you think you know more than someone who has done that for 3- 5  decades especially when you can deal with the valid questions raised (e.g. Bhakti is an ultimate eternal, imperishable goal)?  

Dr. Sanjukta, 80+, taught me for 3 hours at a stretch and then I learnt that she had serious health issues. Please don't underestimate either the commitment or knowledge.

Dear sir,
 Again there goes the thought that sitting at the feet of a scholar and
studying could get the mind set of an academician changed!They
approach a scholar with an already set mental frame which is practically
quite difficult to change.
There is a famous incident with a Zen Master.A professor approached a the
Master  to study Zen principles.The master came with a jug of tea and a cup
and asked the professor to fill it up till the Master say to stop.Professor
started filling but the Master did not say to stop even after the cup was
full to the brim.Then the professor stopped filling.The Master asked why he
stopped.The answer was he didn't know how to pour into a filled cup.
Then the Master said that is also the problem of Him as he also didn't know
how to pour into an already filled up mind!
Here is the significance of Indian traditional education which starts at
the age of seven.The mind set that is needed for the study of vedanta is
gradually developed and if the vasanas are ripe enough one can take the
path of renunciation and study Vedanta.If not take the path of grahasta and
strive to overcome the latent vasanas and enter into the path of
renunciation in a latter period of life. Then only he will be competent for
the study of Vedanta. Knowledge of Vedanta acquired in other ways
by incompetent aspirants can only be that of an "asampradaayavit", to put
in the words of Acharya, and has to be considered as that of an ignorant
one.
Fortunately majority are taking this path(!) and here lies the secret of
the saying of Lord that Jnana is 'guhyayhamam'.Here lies the root of many
problems posed by the academicians.Most of them are not real problems at
all as far as a competent aspirant is considered.Mere "sabdajalam" and are
of course 'chitta vibhrama karanam' and that is what is of interest to an
academician because the aim is dhana and not Jnana.These are the two ways
and the choice is of course that of us.
 Namste.
sivakumarr.
