His respect for Sringeri is something  personal.  But he has said it in the
authority of not just the Bangalore Mutt but the very institution that he
is a part of by using 'we'.

The RK matt has its origins in West Bengal and is not connected with

I am aware of all this but the Swamiji's statement on several occasions is
notwithstanding this.

That is alright.  Nor has the Sringeri mutt acknowledged or denied what the
Swamiji said.  I just stated what I have heard on several occasions and
what is contained in a most recent DVD that was produced by the Sringeri
Mutt itself.  They have included opinions/statements from several important
personalities in the DVD like Swami Dayananda Saraswati and the Chitrapur
Mutt Swamiji.

Certainly I am not force-linking anything here; I just pointed out that
what Sri Rajaram said has a counter in fact.
