///
an aside, is Krishnakarnamrta an advaitic work?
//

KriSNa karNAmrita is a bhakti kAvya. It’s author is a great smArta paNDita
who was well-versed with kAvya, alankAra, nATaka & mimAmsa.

He was a great srividyOpAsaka and worshipped of srividyA rAjagOpAla. 
He practiced the japa of shiva panchAkSari mantra but says 
that his heart longs for “bAla gOpAla”. 

This beautiful verse from “kriSNa karNAmrita” is given below:

///
shaivA vayaM na khalu tatra vichAraNIyaM panchAkSarI japa
parA nitarAM tathA api cetaH (as)madIyaM atasI kusuma 
avabhAsaM smErAnanam smarati gOpa vadhU kiSOraM

//

We are shaivaites and we practisers of panchadashaakshari hymn – 
no doubt about it; even then our heart reminisces on that 
pleasant faced boy in the hue of blackish atasi flower who is the 
darling of his mother yashoda.

regs,
Sriram
