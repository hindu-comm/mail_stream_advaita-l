Bhaskarji, no arguments with what you say below.  I completely agree.

It is generally said by vaishnavas, that their AchAryas had "discovered"
some so-called "faults" in advaita. The point of my post was to show that
Sankara himself had foreseen these objections. So there is nothing new that
was "discovered" by the vaishnavas.

Sorry if my post had given a different impression.

Regards
Kalyan
