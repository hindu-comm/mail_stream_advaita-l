Dear Shri LalitAlAlitah, namaskarams. If one can trace the lineage to Sankara, great. I have no problem with that. But if there is difference of opinion on fundamental issues, each one is going to assert that his guru or lineage is right. If one wants to reconcile the difference, then objective and unbiased analysis is the only way. This is what academic scholars who regard truth high do. 

May I ask who are you to limit the validity of Madhusudana's views? Do you have any basis at all?

Wrong.
Anyone who studied with help of a guru can trace his lineage to AchArya. So
is the case of monks of RK Math. Many of them have studied at kailAsa
Ashrama, R^iShikesh. Now, if any one say that he doesn't consider
paramahaMsa-s coming from sha~Nkara, because they don't have daNDa ; then
the same non-acceptance could be directed towards validity of lineage of
daNDin-s.

But I

Do you think that non-traditional people can think and write correct on
their own ? Then why was this chaos for want of paramparA ? If they can't ,
then how is their work (translation, etc.) good ? Make your thinking clear.
Don't mix social  and emotional issues of 'respecting and not-respecting
someone' in a 'discussion of right or wrong' ?

Don't talk of their teachings which are not related to advaita. They may
have taught many things other than advaita. But, this doesn't prove them
wrong in interpretation of advaita, i.e. upaniShad, etc.

Krishna and His form are different or that

Traditional scholars know the limit and scope of each book. They don't
mingle things to create a new theory which can not stand tests.

 Now, they pose a greater risk because the blind followers

Actually they don't. Because they have tested each view.
Those who learned from paramparA (i.e. starting directly from madhusUdana)
are blind, because they can't deduce wrong conclusions - is a kind of
blindness which is longed by many.
