Subject: [Advaita-l] Fw: Did Madhusudana Saraswati Reconcile Bhakti and Advaita?



Madhusudana Saraswati had difficulty in understanding Adi Sankara in the beginning probably due to his proximity to the Achintya Vedaveda school. However with efforts he could understand Adi Sankara. Now the Advaita does not talk about any other liberation than the Sayyuyya Mukti where there is nothing but total union. In muktis like Sarupya or Salokya mukti there is scope for coexistence with Bhakti but not so in the Sayyuyya mukti.

>Rajaram: Ishould not interfereSri Subrahmanian answering that. My understanding is that Madhusudana Saraswati uses eka jiva vada to address this. According to this, there is only one jiva and liberation happens only when this jiva is. This jiva's liberation is in turn dependent on the liberation of all its reflections. So, when "your jiva" gets liberated it is only partial. So, you actually remain one with Ishwara and can appear in this world again at His will. Now, akhandakara vrtti in the case of jnana and bhakti rasa vrtti in the case of bhakti are modifications of the mind. However, they are in their essence non-different from Brahman in the case of jnana and sweet Lord in the case of bhakti. So, neither jnana nor bhakti have the contingency of perishability.
