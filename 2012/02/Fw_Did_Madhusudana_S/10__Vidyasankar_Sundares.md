Yamunacarya was not an advaitin prior to the development of Ramanujacarya's writings. In
fact, the legend goes that when Ramanuja went to meet Yamuna, the latter was already
dead and the body was already prepared for the funeral. 

The teacher of Ramanuja who is said to have been converted later on by Ramanuja was
Yadavaprakasa of Kanchipuram. He is said to have to have been advaitin, but there are
other indications that Yadavaprakasa was actually a bhedAbheda vAdin, not advaitin.

Regards,
Vidyasankar

> Of course, Yamunacharya did not understand Advaita fully and he  could not dissolve his ego (ie. his individual ego of being separate from the Brahman). The Dvaitins and Visishtadvaitins truly do not understand that He (the Brahman) wanted to be many, as they cannot think of  Him to be without being many at any time. Yamunacharya was an advaitin himself to begin with and Ramanujacharya was his disciple. Later on Ramanujacharya churned out Visishtadvaita and converted Yamunacharjya to his (Ramanujacharya's) way of thinking. The wiles of Prakriti is lurking out all the time and the ego of individuality caught Ramanujacharya and Yamiunacharya back  like it catches everybody.
