The difference between the two is very wide.Krama mukthi is what is called"Pipeelika marga"like ants reach a piece of jaggery,where is sadyomukthi is immediate which is called the "Shukamarga",which is like a parrot straight away flies and pecks at a fruit it sees on the branch of a tree.There were many rishis who followed the "kramamukthi".Jaimini,Bodhayana said that Mukthi is possible by the performance of karmas.They said "sanyasa'is not necesary for the attainment of mukthi.Perhaps,it was during that time the sanyasa was meant for the disabled only.
