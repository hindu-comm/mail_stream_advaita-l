Shaankara Vijnaana Vybhavam at Bangalore

Namaste All,

We have a group of persons pursuing diverse types of careers but
deeply interested in Vedanta. They may be scientists, technologists,
doctors etc.. but the element of mumukshatva in them has attracted
them towards study of philosophy to understand the truth.This has led
them to the light shown by Adi Shankara and his exposition of Vedanta.

A group of such persons have collectively proposed to have a programme
organised to have a thorough and in depth view of the Siddhanta with
the help of eminent Sanyasis and Vedantic scholors. The above
programme is organised as part of Shankara Jayanthi from 10th  May
2012 to 12th May for the benefit of mumukshus only.
