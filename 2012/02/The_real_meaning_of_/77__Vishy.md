Respected Members,


We all adore lord Ganesha and offer our prayers/ poojas first to him
before starting any activity.
But, I certainly feel that whole story about Lord Ganesha's creation should be a 
parable and there should be deeper inner meaning to it.
Request learned members to through some light on the real/inner meaning of this
story, please

Warm regards
Viswanathan
