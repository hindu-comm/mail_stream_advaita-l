*I have given you t he date. You made a similar request  to quote the
original sanskrit text for Prof. Nelson's translation. I did that and then
you asked me to quote them side by side. I did and you did not find
anything wrong with the translation. You simply have not answered what work
of Prof. Nelson you are quoting from. *

*You are wrong. She says that is AS is most probably before BhR. Nelson
says that AS and BBR were written about the same time. Anyway, GAD which is
later than all these works gives a clear authority to BhR. So, you have no
point to make. His knowledge of Advaita was well established long before
AS. So, your theory that "he did not understand" or "he might not have" is
baseless. *
