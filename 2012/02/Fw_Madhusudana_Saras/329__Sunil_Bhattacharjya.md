Dear friends,

Here is a addendum. You might have very well observed that Rajaram failed to give the name of the father of Madhusudana Saraswati (MS) and any other details. Rajaram also failed to give what was his mother tongue 
and which community he belonged to. That shows thatRajaram has pure imagination and not even a believable story to say that Madhusudana was from the south. Having failed to show that MS was from the south India he wants to brush aside the view that MS was from Bengal by calling all other views as stories. 


MS is generally believed to be born at Unshia villagein the Gopalganj district (prior to 1985 the Kotalipara sub-division of the Faridpur district) in Bangladesh. He died in Mayapurin Navadwip in West Bengal. Let Rajaram call these as stories as he finds that convenient to say. However for the members who wans to know about the generally accepted position let me also draw your attention to the fact that Prof. Karmarkar in his edited "Vedanta-kalpa-latika" has given the genealogy of MS and has said that MS is generally accepted to have been born and bred in Bengal and that his name was Kamalajanayana. When he became a Sanyashin he changed his name to Madhusudana Saraswati.

Regards,

Sunil KB

There are only stories. Even a basic student of Madhusudana knows this.

IF ALL ARE STORIES THEN YOU TOO DON'T HAVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN STORY>

>Just claiming to be ditto copy cannot save you Mr. Rajaram. Now you are caught redhanded. Why can't you quote rather than claiming?
>

I have given you t he date. You made a similar request to quote the original sanskrit text for Prof. Nelson's translation. I did that and then you asked me to quote them side by side. I did and you did not find anything wrong with the translation. You simply have not answered what work of Prof. Nelson you are quoting from. 

I ma sure you mean red-handed in the sense I have the kumkuma prasadam in my hand :)

HA HA, THE VERY FACT THAT YOU ARE ASKING ME TO GIVE THE REFERENCE FROM WHERE I QUOTED SHOWS THAT I HAVE QUOTED SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU QUOTED. THAT EXPOSES YOU. YOU HAVE TRASH IN YOUR HAND.

>Thye question was whether the Gidhartha_didpika and Advaita-siddhi are after Bhasgavad-bhakti-rasayana (BBR) of before BBR. You cannot prove Advaita-siddhi to be before BBR. Professor Gupta is sure that Gudhartha dipika succeeded Bhagavad-bhakti-rasayana but she is not know about the Advaita-siddhi. So leave her alone. Prof. Pandeya and Prof. Nelson opined that BBR preceded Advaita-siddhi. So that settles the issue for me. You can even forget Anand Hubliji in this context as he has not reaffirmed his position on this issue. Now that Adavia-siddhi succeeded BBR please do not waste any time time on lingering on this issue.
>

You are wrong. She says that is AS is most probably before BhR. Nelson says that AS and BBR were written about the same time. Anyway, GAD which is later than all these works gives a clear authority to BhR. So, you have no point to make. His knowledge of Advaita was well established long before AS. So, your theory that "he did not understand" or "he might not have" is baseless.

YOU ARE WRONG. PROFESSOR GUPTA SAYS SHE IS NOT SURE WHETHER AS PRECEDES OR SUCCEEDS BhR. PROFESSOR NELSON SAYS BhR PRECEDED AS. SO PLEASE LEARN TO RESPECT THE TRUTH.

>I think you have to brush up your English and be honest. I did not say Madhusudana stole any idea from the Gaudiya school.. Madhusudana could have been influenced by the Chaitanya's school at one point in his life and that is not called staeling, Mr. Rajaram..Madhuasudana was an honest person. As you are casting doubt on his honesty I am now compelled to doubt your own honesty.

>I dont think you got the pun. Anyway, I dont nee to take English lessons from some one who writes, "Professor Gupta is sure that Gudhartha dipika succeeded Bhagavad-bhakti-rasayana but she is not know about the Advaita-siddhi."
