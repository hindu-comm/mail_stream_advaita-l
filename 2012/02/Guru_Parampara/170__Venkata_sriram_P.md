Namaste,

A pUrva-pakSin would never reconcile with his opponent. 

Bhagavan Veda Vyasa Himself said in Mahabharata as:

////

nA(a) viSNuH kIrtayEdviSNuM nA(a) viSNurviSNumarchayEt
nA(a)viSNuH saMsmarEd viSNuM nA(a) viSNurviSNumApnuyAt

Without identifying himself with Vishnu (without becoming Vishnu), 
one should not chant names of Vishnu; without identifying himself with Vishnu, 
should not worship Vishnu and also should not remember Vishnu. 

Thus, without becoming Vishnu, one cannot attain Vishnu.

What more grandeur of Advaita we can expect from Bhagavan
Veda Vyasa?

Regs,
Sriram
