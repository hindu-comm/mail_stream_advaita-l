Pranamas to all list members.
The advaita guru parampara says that the grand guru of Adi Shankara
bhagavatpada, i.e Gaudabhagavatpada was the disciple of Sri Shuka, i.e
the son of Vyasa. Now we all know that Sri Shuka was a sage par
excellence and was the chief narrator of the Srimad Bhagavata purana.
Since Sri Gaudapada was a prime disciple of Shuka isn't it evident
that the correct interpretation of the Bhagavata is accredited to
Advaita vedanta? Still, how is it that the Vaishnavas regard their
versions as more appropriate? Do they mean Sri Vyasa and Sri Shuka
themselves were incorrect?
