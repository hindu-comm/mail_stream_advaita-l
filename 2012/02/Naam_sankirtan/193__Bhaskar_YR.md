Sutra 2-2-29 cannot be explained if both Waking
and Dream objects are same.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

It can be explained even by holding the temporary nature of this waking 
world because here in this sUtra shankara's views are under different 
context.  Here he  is refuting vijnAnavAdin's view.  But same shankara in 
kArika & mAdUkya bhAshya explicitly clarifies the unreality and temporary 
nature of this waking world too and hardly treats this waking world 
different from dream !!!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
