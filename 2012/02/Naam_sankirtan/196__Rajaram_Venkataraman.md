Rajaram: In gudartha Dipika, he specifically says that *in this very life
itself for the bhakta *- no need to go to Brahmaloka and wait till the end
of kalpa. I forget the reference. I think it is in one of the middle 6
chapters. In BhR, he very clearly says that a bhakta realizes the svarupa
of the lord directly in the fifth stage itself. So, a bhakta attains jivan
mukti.
