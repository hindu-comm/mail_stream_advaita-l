Dear Subrahmanian-ji,

>Of course, as Shri Anand Hudli ji just pointed out a bhakta can have the
>Jnana upadesha revealed to him not necessarily by an external guru.

Although it was clear in my message that I referred by a link, my
previous message may not be that clear. MadhusUdana is saying that the
VedAnta vAkyas become revealed to the upAsaka, who has reached the
pinnacle of saguNopAsana, in Brahmaloka, not while living here. This
is as far as I can understand from his commentary, the gUDhArtha
dIpikA.

Regards,

Anand
