Will Ishwara perish also? Otherwise, don't they exist in Him as His memory so that He can recreate like before?

All loka-s will perish in pralaya.  They reappear in the next sriShTi.  In
any case this creation-destruction cycle itself is eternal but its
eternality is different from Brahman's nityatva.  As we have seen earlier
the former is called 'pariNAmi nitya' and the latter 'kUTastha nitya'.  The
former is mithyA and the latter satya.  MAyA is the former and Brahman is
the latter.
