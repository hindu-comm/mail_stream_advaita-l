I would like to see the context and the actual dialogue involved.  Right
now I do not have the book with me.

On one occasion He has said in reply to a questioner:  One can indulge in
bhajana (nama sankeertana) AFTER one has finished the sandhya vandanam and
not as a replacement to it.

Of course, as Shri Anand Hudli ji just pointed out a bhakta can have the
Jnana upadesha revealed to him not necessarily by an external guru.  I had
also indicated this possibility in a reply to Rajaram that the upadesha can
happen in any way; not niyata.  But these are exceptions and not the rule.
