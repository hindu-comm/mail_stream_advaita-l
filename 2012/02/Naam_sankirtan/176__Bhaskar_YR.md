On one occasion He has said in reply to a questioner:  One can indulge in
bhajana (nama sankeertana) AFTER one has finished the sandhya vandanam and

Hare Krishna

Yes, it is something like above he insists in his dialogue.  He advises, 
one should not skip his nitya & naimittika karma and do nAma saMkeertana

praising his guru without doing any work as entrusted by his guru and 
another who is sincerely following his guru's instruction in executing his 
duties. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
