MadhusUdana has referred to "brahmaloka" in his commentary on Gita 12.6 and
"hiraNyagarbhaloka" in his commentary on 8.5. He says the worshiper of
saguNa brahman reaches this loka through "devayAnamArga", the path of Gods.
This is perhaps in accordance with Brahma sutras 4.2.18-19 and 4.3.10.

The brahmaloka can be thought of the highest place in the vyAvahArika
realm. The characteristics of the soul in Brahmaloka are described in
Brahma sutras 4.4.8-22, for example as achieving its desires by merely
willing them, "sankalpAdeva tu tacchruteH".

Here, MadhusUdana is careful enough to point out that the saguNopAsana has
to be of type "ye mAM sarvayogeshvarANAM IshvaraM sarvajnaM
samastakalyANaguNanilayaM sAkAraM nityayuktAH satatodyuktAH shraddayA
parayA sAttvikyopetAH santa upAsate sadA cintayanti te yuktatamAH " (12.2
comm.), i.e those who constantly worship Him with sAttvika shraddhA.
Elsewhere, (18.66) he outlines the three stages of bhakti. It is in the
third stage that the bhakta feels "sa evAham", "I am He". We can call this
the culmination or pinnacle of bhakti or upAsana, where total
non-difference from God is experienced.

If there are other upAsakas who worship God in some way other than
non-difference, they must be considered to be in lower stages of Bhakti, as
per MadhusUdana. What MadhusUdana is saying in the 12th chapter is that
knowledge of vedAnta is not essential to *ultimately* attain the nirguna
brahman of the upaniShads. saguNopAsana will carry, so to speak, the
upAsaka to that stage.

Even if they do not subscribe to any vedAntic school, by doing saguNopAsana
in the proper way, they will *ultimately* reach the same goal.

Please see my comments above.
