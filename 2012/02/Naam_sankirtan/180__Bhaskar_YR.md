Karma anuShTanam is recognition that I am never a karthaa while all 
obligatory karmas are being done.

Yes, I do agree karma what we do should elevate us to the nishkAma or 
karma yOga.  The essence of H.H. dialogue is very simple. To the question, 
is there any 'substitute' for veda vihita karma and can one do 'something 
else (like nAma saMkeertana) instead of doing veda vihita karma since both 
are serving the same purpose (chitta shuddhi) ??  His answer is an 
explicit 'NO', it is simply because for karmAnushtAna and svadharma, 
shAstra is the only pramANa and veda vihita karma-s are not optional but 
an obligatory injunction  as long as one stays in his respective Ashrama. 

In short, do nAma samkeertana instead of watching cricket matches on TV 
but NOT at the cost of your daily sandhyAvandana & svAdhyAya :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
