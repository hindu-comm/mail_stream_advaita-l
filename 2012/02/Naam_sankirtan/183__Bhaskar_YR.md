Where is this brahmaloka? Or what exactly is meant by a brahmaloka?

> shankara while talking about hiraNyagarbha lOka or brahma lOka which is 
the abode for the saguNOpAsaka-s, did not mention the address of this 
lOka.  However, he talks about mahApraLaya, brahma jnAna upadesha from 
brahmA etc. in that lOka, it appears that this lOka is entirely different 
from bhUlOka and svarga-naraka. 

Some real place? Or some thing metaphorical and not real?

>  if you have some esoteric meaning for this lOka, kindly do share with 
us.  I have read in some yOga related article that 'brahma lOka' is 
nothing put 'AjnA chakra' (the place between the eye brows) in a rAja 
yOgi. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
