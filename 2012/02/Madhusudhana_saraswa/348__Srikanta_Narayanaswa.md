Also the first verse of this chapter as quoted by you is not exactly the
> same as it appears in the printed versions:
> 
> उपासनाश्रितो धर्मो जाते ब्रह्मणि वर्तते ।
> प्रागुत्पत्तेरजं सर्वं तेनासौ कृपणः स्मृतः ॥ 1 ॥
> 
> It is no doubt beneficial to study the Shankara bhashyam on this verse
> too. In a nutshell it says:
> 
> The upAsaka thinks that he will attain liberation by contemplating upon the
> saguNa/born Brahman, after the fall of the body. Since he has the
> knowledge of only the lower, kShudra, brahman, he (the upAsaka) is
> considered 'kRupaNaH', pitiable, by the knowers, Jnanis, of the Ever Unborn
> Brahman (nirguNa Brahman).

Such an implication is not there in the Gaudapada karika.He is miserly who doesnot perceive the "Brahman"as per the Shruthi texts.
