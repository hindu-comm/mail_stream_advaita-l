'aprAkRtam' and 'prAkRtam' are both within prakRti alone:  This is the
conclusion of Advaitins. The former is a word that could confuse people who
would readily think 'aprAkRtam' is something outside prakRti and distinct
from something that is an effect of prakRti which is called by the name
'prAkRtam'.  As I had pointed out in the passing, the Dvaitins admit of two
VaikunThas: a prAkRta and another aprAkRta.  The one from which jaya-vijaya
returned is the former and from the latter there is no return.

But in Advaita wherever there is dvaitam and the possibility of dvaitam, it
is within the broad definition of prAkRtam alone, coming as it under the
prakRti, whether one chooses to term it prAkRtam or aprAkRtam.

This definition/derivation is purely mine: अन्तवत्प्रकृतिकम् प्राकृतम्,
अनन्तप्राकृतम् अप्राकृतम् .  That which has an end (and a beginning) is
prAkRtam.  That which does not have an end by perishing is aprAkRtam.  The
latter can be said/admitted by those who want it  to be so, as pariNAmi
nityam. Set against this is the kUTastha nityam, the NirguNa Brahman of the
Vedanta.
