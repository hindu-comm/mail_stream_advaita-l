The Shankarabhashya sentence I showed from the Kenopanishat is sufficient
proof for the teaching that everything 'meditatable' as Ishwara, etc.
(aadi) is idam and anaatmA.

It is the teaching of the Advaita sampradaya that forms the basis of my
understanding.

In the Anandagiri gloss for 8.9 he quotes a Brahmasutra 3.2.14 which
decides that Brahman is to be known/realized as without any form ONLY.  A
question is taken up:  what is the fate of those shruti passages that give
a form to Brahman? The reply is: these are upAdhi-based forms and do not
constitute the svarUpa of Brahman. The BhAshyotkarsha deepika of Dhanapati
suri on this BF 8.9 gives a gist of the Brahma sutra/bhashya.

Madhusudana on BF 8.9 does not differ from Shankara's commentary.

On the 16th Feb 2012  I had cited a Kaivalyopanishad mantra:

//While looking for references in the Upanishads for the concept of
'bhakti' as connected with 'jnanam' this is a useful one from the Kaivalya
Upanishad:

अचिन्त्यमव्यक्तमनन्तरूपं शिवं प्रशान्तममृतं ब्रह्मयोनिम् ।
तथा ऽऽदिमध्यान्तविहीनमेकं विभुं चिदानन्दमरूपमद्भुतम् ।।६।।
7
उमासहायं परमेश्वरं प्रभुं त्रिलोचनं नीलकण्ठं प्रशान्तम् ।
ध्यात्वा मुनिर्गच्छति भूतयोनिं समस्तसाक्षिं तमसः परस्तात् ।।७।।
8
स ब्रह्मा स शिवः सेन्द्रः सो ऽक्षरः परमः स्वराट् ।
स एव विष्णुः स प्राणः स कालो ऽग्निः स चन्द्रमाः ॥८॥

Here the 7th one is very useful to trace the saguNa bhakti culminating in
NirguNa jnanam.

The BG 8.9 is an exact re-statement of the mantra 7 above where both the
saguNa and nirguNa lakShanas are given in one verse/mantra.
