Sir,

My intention in quoting that kArikA and the bhashya was only to show that
the concept of Bhakti is well enshrined in the Vedic/Advaitic tradition and
not an addition from some other system at a later point of time.  Shankara
says that 'apart from the Ultimate Truth, the Vedanta has laid out upAsana
and karma too to cater to the less-equipped adhikArins so that they too
can, by adopting these means, rise up to the level of
understanding/appreciating the Ultimate Truth.  The Veda and the Advaita
Acharyas know very well that the difference between the jiva and Brahman
that underlies upAsana and karma is only a temporarily accepted feature for
the enabling their practice and that in the absolute terms there is no
difference of whatever kind.
