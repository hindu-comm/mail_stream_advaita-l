It is interesting that his logical approach should be called in to question by "scholars" in an advaita forum. I am not surprised, there is another gentleman who questioned even his understanding of advaitam in this forum and went unchallenged :)

Well, you were challenging it quite strongly, so it didn't go unchallenged.

This forum should be clearly understood only as a forum, where people
exchange ideas/opinions. It is inevitable that different people have their
different views and others have their own views about those views!
