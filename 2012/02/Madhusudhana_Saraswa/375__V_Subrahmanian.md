I think we have discussed this aspect before on this forum quite recently.
I shall summarize here:

Madhusudana Saraswati has explained what is meant by 'aprAkRtam' in the
Advaita siddhi and the Brahnanandi has elaborated on it.  I got this from
the authority of Dr.Mani Dravid SastrigaL.  What is aprAkrtiam is also
within prakRti alone and the difference is: the prAkRta effects go through
a paanchabhautika process for manifestation and the apraakRta effects
bypass this process and emerge straight from mAyA/prkRti.

Also to add a clarification on what I said before on the Brahma sutra
reference, the passages teaching form to Brahman are valid in the relative
realm for the purposes of upAsanA.  I had omitted this aspect in my earlier
reply.  Now, it adds to the discussion on the stated GaudapAda karikA in
question.  So, upAsanA includes not just hiranyagarbha but any other deity
for which a form is possible.
