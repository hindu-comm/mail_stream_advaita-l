When you offer (arpana), even to the elements, do you offer to the
insentient or the sentient? I don't know of any thing insentient that can
accept anyone's offering. To do that is like talking to a wall. When one
says "lam prithivyatmane gandham samarpayami", one offers to the Deity
within prithivi or the deity within that to the extent one's buddhi can
reach. If the buddhi can intuit Ishwara or Brahman, upto that.

The "fixation" of atmaramas - not mine - with the super excellent qualities
of Hari is from both Bhagavatam and Gudarthadipika.
