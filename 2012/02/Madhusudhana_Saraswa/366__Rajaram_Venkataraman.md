As per my understanding, the following is the scheme.

Karma = Manogati (level 1)
Sadhana Bhakti = Manogati (Level 2)
Upasana = Manogati (Level 3)
Sthayi Bhava Bhakti = Manovrtti (Level 4)
Siddha Upasana = Manovrtti (Level 4)
Para Bhakti (Realization of Gopalaham) = jnana (Level 5)

Manogati is flow of mind whereas Manovrtti is permanent modification. It is
like temporary and permanent tattoo on the body.
