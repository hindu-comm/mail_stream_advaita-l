It is a formless form. I am not adept at explaining it but an open minded
and patient reading of Madhusudana on BG 4.7 will make it amply clear. It
will also clarify why Advaita tradition produced more Bhakti literature
than vaishnavas and Saivites put together.  And why in the villages of
India, Sankara remains a reverred acharya and atmartha Bhakti is part of
the vocabulary of common people who call each other Sami.
