How can that which is called aprakrtam by Sankara be said to be within
Prakriti by us? Does Sri  sastrigal say that His form Is created and
destroyed, limited by space? Does he say there is a difference between Him
and His body? Madhusudana, and so does Sridhara, in unmistakable terms say
that His body is  not panchabautika. It is not limited by space or time.
Madhusudana, categorically, says that it is illogical for one to argue that
there is a difference between His body and Him.
