In his reply,V.Subramaniam had quoted the following karika on the "upasana".
Sir,

Sri GauDapAdAchArya in the kArikA 3.16 says:

आश्रमास्त्रिविधा हीनमध्यमोत्कृष्टदृष्टयः ।
उपासनोपदिष्टेयं तदर्थमनुकम्पया ॥ 16 ॥
But,the term "pragutpateh"again occurs in the karika .14 of the Advaita prakarana.
It says:
Jivatmanoh prthakatvam yath pragutpatteh prakirtitam!
bhavishyadvrtya gaunam tan mukhyatvam hi na yujyate!!--III.14.
"the difference between the jiva and the Atman'which is said before the origination is only "gauna"(figurative)from the point oview of future occurrence,because it is not used in the "primary sense".
Hence,the discussion is not with reference to the 'ashrama like hina,madhyama and utkrshta.
N.Srikanta.
