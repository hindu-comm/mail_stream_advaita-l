With due respects to you, no one contests that Brahman is beyond all names
and forms in Advaita. However, Madhusudana elaborates on BG 4.7
commentary of Sankara (Mayavadam Aprakrtam) to explain why Lord Krishna's
form is not material (pancha baudhika). He explains the nature of this form
and why it is highly illogical to assume that the Lord has a body distinct
from the Self. It is two page too long to post here. This is the same view
held by Sridhara Swami as well. If you think they wrote under influence,
then you need to show at least one advaita acharya before Madhusudana, who
says that the Lord's form is material (pancha baudhika). The implication of
it not being pancha-baudhika is that it is beyond spacio-temporal
limitations unlike other meditable objects which are anatma.  There is a
clear difference between the effects of maya (created material objects) and
maya itself, which is beyond time and space.
