>you cannot perform 
Upasana without Bhakti.


Yes you can! I am not theorizing something here. I am only telling what I have studied and also seen.

Broaden your study , remove earlier assumptions about upAsana and closely observe people who practice this stuff and you will eventually see that upAsana and bhakti are two different things.
