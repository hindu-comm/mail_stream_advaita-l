Namaste

Adi Sankara has said in Svetashvarataropanishad Bhashya- Tathaca
Sukasishyo Gaudapadacaryaha.

Gaudapada did penance for Sriman Naryana in Badari. He got Advaita
instruction from Suka.

One possible situation is like this. Gaudapada said waking and dream
are same. Probably he got Upadesha from Suka in the dream. But getting
Upadesha in dream and waking are same for him. He became Suka Sishya.

There is no need for him to actually get Upadesha from Guru like
ordinary people. He can get it in dream.
