Namaste,

Sri Shuka is said to be the guru of Adi Shankara's grand guru Sri
Gaudapada. Is there any story relating to how Gaudapada met his guru
Shuka, similar to how Shankara met Govindapada? Also, what would be
Gaudapada's lifetime be acknowledging the Shuka was the son of Vyasa?
Could any fellow list member throw light on the relation between Shuka
and Gaudapa?
