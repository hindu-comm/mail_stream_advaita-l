In a shortened guruparampara not all gurus are mentioned. For example one can say that starting from Lord Shiva in the beginning, Adi Sankara in middle and the  present guru at this end constitute one's guruparampara. That explains the gap between Gaudapada ans Shuka. This is as simple as that

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Shuka and Gaudapada

In that case, many sages, sanyasins,etc can be regarded as
chiranjeevis. Nevertheless, that's not my primary question. My
question correlates to how Sri Gaudapada was found and taken up by Sri
Shuka. Is there any tale like the ones pertaining to Sri Shankara and
his 4 main disciples?
