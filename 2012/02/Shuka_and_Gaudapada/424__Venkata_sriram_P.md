Namaste,

/////

The portion of the mahabhashya which was lost is the aja bhakshita
bhashya. If so why is it that chandra sharma(govindapada) never asked
his guru Gaudapada for that part of the bhashya on meeting him again
at the time of taking sanyasatva

///

Patanjali Charita is a good kAvya and it should be only studied from the 
perspective of kAvya and alankAra. It can't be extrapolated and linked
with historicity of gauDapAda and govindabhagavatpAda. 

What can be more blasphemous to think that gauDapAda was a brahmarAkSasa !

regs,
sriram
