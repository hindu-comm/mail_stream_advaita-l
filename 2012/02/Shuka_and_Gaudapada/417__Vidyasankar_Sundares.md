Yes, Suka is not one of the 7 ciranjIvins, only vyAsa is counted in the standard list.

There is no noteworthy account of how gauDapAda met Suka like you are looking for.
There is a legendary story about gauDapAda and govinda bhagavatpAda in the 17th
century poem called patanjali carita, but it is not of any historical value and it is not
very flattering about gauDapAda either. The details of that account have already been
posted on the list.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
