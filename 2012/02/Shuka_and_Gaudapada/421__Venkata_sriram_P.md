Namaste,

//
Bhagavata speaks of only one Suka.

//

What about the the suka mentioned in Devi Bhagavata. He is also a vyAsa putra who is said to have married and gave birth to 4 sons.

My acharya Br.Sri Narendra Kapreji told me that there is also a chAyA shuka and
there are sampradAya bhEdAs associated with shuka yogindra. 

regs,
sriram
