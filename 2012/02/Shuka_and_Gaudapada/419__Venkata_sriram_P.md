Namaste,

I have used a wrong word "limited understanding" in the sentence below:

// 

So, biographical sketches of saints are based on the author’s 
limited understanding of “guru tattva”.

//

It should have been "understanding of guru tattva which which is an 
expression beyond words".

Inconvenience is regretted.

regs,
sriram
