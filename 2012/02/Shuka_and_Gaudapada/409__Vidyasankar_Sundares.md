>From the patanjali carita of rAmabhadra dIkshita, a 17th century poem.

Note that the original Sanskrit verses name the grammar student of a
brahmarAkshasa as candragupta, not as candraSarmA. The name has
become candraSarmA in the English renditions of the talks given by the
Kanchi Acharya.

Note also that the story of gauDapAda having been cursed to become a
brahmarAkshasa and eating up people who couln't answer questions on
grammar is what I described as not being very flattering to gauDapAda.
The story is one person's poetic fancy and should be understood as such.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
