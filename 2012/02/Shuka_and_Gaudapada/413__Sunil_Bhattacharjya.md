There is one hitch in this story. Adishasha is a Naga and is non-poisonous, while Vasuki is a Sarpa and is poisonous. Garuda was chasing Vasuki and Lord Shiva protected Vasuki by allowing him to coil around the neck of the Lord.

Many thanks for providing this story. I have one question. From where
is it that Kanchi Swamiji extracted this story? I ask this as there is
no mention of such a story in the Digvijayas. Is there any scriptural
evidence which accredits this information?

BhavatyAh,
Abhishek Madhyastha
