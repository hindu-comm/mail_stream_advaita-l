Namaste Rajaramji,

You mentioned:

///

Sankara quotes Hari Vamsa in the introduction to Vishnu Sahasranama, 
Which most scholars admit is his work. It describes the different rasas 
but have to find a critical edition.

//

Request you to give reference where exactly the "rasa" has been
used. I have seen several references to "hari vaMsa", but it
extols it's mAhatmya only. I am not able to locate the rasAs
in introduction to VS by Sankara. Probably due to my oversight.

regs,
sriram
