No I think Shri Subrahmanian has it right.

The point MS is making is that karma is limited by the circumstances of 
the karta.  If one is not a dwija one cannot learn Vedic mantras.  If one 
is a dwija but never learned one cannot recite them.  Even if one is a 
dwija who has learned the Vedas, if one is blind, deaf or impotent etc. 
one cannot perform the yajnas.  Even if one is a dwija who is learned and 
physically fit, one may not have the financial resources to perform a 
yajna.  And without performance there is no result.  For Bhakti, the only 
limitation is shraddha just as for mukti the only limitation is jnana.
