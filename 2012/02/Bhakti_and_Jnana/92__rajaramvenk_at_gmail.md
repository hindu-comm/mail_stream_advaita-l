I hear para bhakti being equated to jnana. I would like to know how otherwise they can be equated. They are two different words with distinctly different meanings. 

Madhusudana treats them as distinct entities but equates them on the basis that they are ultimate goal, which is bliss. That sounds logical but not equating bhakti to jnana. Any explanation please?
