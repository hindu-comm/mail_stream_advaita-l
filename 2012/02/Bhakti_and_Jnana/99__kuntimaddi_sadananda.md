PraNAms

In Vivekachudamani Shankara defines Bhakti as

mokshakaaraNa saamaagryaam bhaktireva gariiyasi|
swaswaruupaanusandhaanaam bhaktirityabhidhiiyate||

Swaamtaanubhavasandhaanam bhaktiriti aparejaguH||

Of all the paths for moksha, bhakti is the supreme. - that bhakti is defined as swa swaruupa anusandhaanaam - contemplation on the intrinsic nature of one's own self. Others say that Bhakti is realization of owns own self. 

>From this from the point of advaita, ultimate bhakti is not different from jnaana. 

Hari Om!
