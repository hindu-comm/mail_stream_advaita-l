Dear members,

It is said that being a great bhakta, Sri Ramakrishna found it very tough
to move from saguNa brahman (in his case, goddess Kali) to nirguNa brahman
because of his attachment to the mother goddess. But still, he made this
transition to achieve jivan mukti. On the other hand, most of us are light
years away from reaching this stage, so the discussion on bhakti vs. jNAna
is mostly of academic interest for the time being.

Now Sunilji, since you mention about Hanuman, I have the following to say -
In North India, Hanuman is considered to be an aMsa of Lord Siva. For
example, Tulsidas, in his hanuman chAleesA refers to hanuman as "Sankara
suvana". If Hanuman is an aMsa of Siva, then he is already a jNAni, though
he can also be considered as an ideal bhakta.

Regards
Kalyan
