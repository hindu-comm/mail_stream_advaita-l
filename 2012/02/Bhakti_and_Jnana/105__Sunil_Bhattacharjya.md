I don't send group-mails t trash. I did tell you that I would send your private mails to me to the spam box as in those you were personally attacking me. If the Moderatorji permits I can forward your those personal mails to the list.

Anyway you are yet to give the translation of Nelson alongside the original Sanskrit verse.

Also, I felt it is easier to write in English in an English list. Anyway, please refer BR 1 Sec XI.You are free to find faults in Prof. Nelson's translation.
