Namaste,

Rajaram: Dr. Sanjukta's view, "Neither bhakti nor jnanam are sublated in
Brahman. What we see (or experience) is a reflection of pure bliss which is
the svarupa of bhakti and jnana. And the reflection is non-different from
the original as per the bimba-pratibimba vada.

IMO, the above view of Dr. Sanjukta on Shri Madhusudana is correct. As per MS, the sthAyee bhAva of bhakti rasa is "Ananda" and He equates this with upaniSad vAkya "rasO vai rasaH"

regs,
sriram
