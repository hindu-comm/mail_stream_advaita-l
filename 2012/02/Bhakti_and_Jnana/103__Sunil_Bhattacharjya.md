Rajaramji, 


Subrahmanianji would reply to you. However would you not like to quote the Sanskrit verse(s) with reference where Madhusudana Saraswati said as you are reporting? Why depend on Nelson's translation alone. The forum has people who know Sanskrit.

Rajaram: Shouln't any opinion on Madhusudana be based on a traditional
study or an academic study? This is what Madhusudana says (translation by
Prof. Lance Nelson) in response to the objection that bhakti is perishable
due to death, ""Heaven and other goals cannot be enjoyed forever. They can
only be experienced at certain limited times and places through certain
specific bodies and sense organs and moreover they are pervaded by the
two-fold pain of perishability and contingency. So, they are certainly not
ultimate. The uninterrupted flow of the bliss of devotion, however, is
ultimate because it can be enjoyed equally in all times and places *without
limitation as to body and sense organs*, like the fruit of knowledge of
Brahman, and because it does not have the two-fold pain of perishability
and contingency."
