Hari Om! Pranaams!

>I hear para bhakti being equated to jnana. I would like to know how otherwise they can be equated. 
Does parA in the sentence qualify only bhaktiH. In GYAna/vidyA do parA/aparA exist.

>They are two different words with distinctly different meanings.
Do you subscribe to the view that there are no paryAya-shabdas, then how do you reconcile that all names of sahasranAma denote same Lord.

In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
