Dear friends,

May I request the learned readers to give their opinion on the origin of the word "Bhakti" and its marning in relation to Vedanta. 


Bhakti, as I understand, comes from the root "Bhaj", which means to divide. Bhakta is the divided state. Bhakta recognizes the division from whom he has got divided and relish the division. Bhakta to me always wants to be near that from whom it got divided but not to lose the "Bhakta" identity. Hanuman being a Jnani, he alone among those present near Lord Ram, deserved the grace of Lord Ram in the form of Sayujya mukti. However Hanuman preferred to stay divided, ie. as a Bhakta and refused to accept the Sayujya Mukti from the Lord. The Jnanis alone are offered the Sayujya Mukti.


Regards,

Sunil KB

Subject: [Advaita-l] Bhakti and Jnana

I hear para bhakti being equated to jnana. I would like to know how otherwise they can be equated. They are two different words with distinctly different meanings. 

Madhusudana treats them as distinct entities but equates them on the basis that they are ultimate goal, which is bliss. That sounds logical but not equating bhakti to jnana. Any explanation please?
