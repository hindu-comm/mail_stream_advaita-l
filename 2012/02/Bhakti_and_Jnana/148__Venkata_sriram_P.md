Namaste,

Speaking in *strictest* vedic sense, nAma sankeertana & bhakti is not to be
found in shrutis. The entire shruti can be classified into 3 categories
that speak of karma, upAsana & jnAna. And depending upon that the sAdhakA's
life span has been designed as "tryAyuSaM" as 116 years. The 1st span is dedicated
for karma, the 2nd for upAsana and the third for jnAna. 

Shankara Bhagavatpada says:

"karmOpAsanA jnAnakANDa bhEdEna chatvArOpi vEdAH triprakArAH"

Even the concept of yajna is divided into 3 sAvanAs as prAtaH, madhyAHna & sAyaM 
sAvana respectively presided by 8 vasus, 11 rudrAs & 12 Adityas. The chandas for 
prAtaH sAvana is gAyatri, for mAdhyAHnika is triSTup and for sAyaM sAvana is jagati. 
Thus, these 3 sAvanAs become the 3 feet of viSNu who is extolled as "tri-vikrama". 
And hence, the shruti vAkya "yajnO vai viSNuH". 

If at all, the yajamAna has devotion to viSNu, he would study the pUrva-mimAmsa,
related shrauta rituals and try to follow the karma kANDa with extreme care. 

So, for this yajamAna, performance of ordained karma with "shraddha"& "diksha" is
bhakti. Because, he is devoted to his own swa-dharma anuSTAna.
