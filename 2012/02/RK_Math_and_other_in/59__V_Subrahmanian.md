You can see a long list of books, several in Sanskrit ONLY, on a variety of
subjects/topics, published either directly by Sringeri Mutt or by their
allied organizations.  Here is just a sample.

within listing the books)


Laghuchandrika Prakashah - Part

Laghuchandrika Prakashah - Part
2<http://www.sringeri.net/2003/12/28/publication/book/laghuchandrika-prakashah.htm>
These two are on the Advaita Siddhi.

There are books on Brahmasutra bhashya.
