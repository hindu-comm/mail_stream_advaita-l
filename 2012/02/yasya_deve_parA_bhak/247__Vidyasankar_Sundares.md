Yes, the commentary on the SvetASvataropanishat is probably from a later author, but
there are numerous instances in the prAthAna traya bhAshya-s where Sankara quotes
this text.

As far as vedAntins are concerned, this "later addition" concept is totally irrelevant. There
may well be differences within the time period to which a critical scholar may assign this
text as compared to the chAndogya or bRhadAraNyaka, but SvetASvatara is an integral
part of the Sruti prasthAna.
