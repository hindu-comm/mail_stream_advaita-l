Doesn't answer the question.

Yes, I believe that these are the generally accepted dates.

I think it is very probable though in the absence of hard evidence I can't 
say more than that.

That's the formal parampara.  However several pre-Shankaran Advaitins are 
known from quotations in various works such as Sundara Pandya, 
Brahmanandin, Dravidacharya etc.  How far back do they go?  We are unable 
to say at this time.

It could be any.  What I mean is that whether a particular work survives 
or is lost is up to the vagaries of fortune.  And invasions are just one 
possibility.  Perhaps Shankaracharyas exposition of Advaita Vedanta was so 
brilliant it obsoleted all earlier attempts.  According to tradition this 
is what happened to Mandana Mishras brand of Advaita Vedanta as expressed 
in the brahmasiddhi.  He is said to have given it up after meeting 
Shankaracharya.  In the Indian environment if a manuscript is not 
periodically copied then it soon ceases to exist.

The names I mention above are well known to historians of Advaita Vedanta.
