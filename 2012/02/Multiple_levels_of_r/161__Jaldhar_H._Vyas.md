We're talking about multiple levels of reality aren't we?  I agree that 
karmakanda doesn't speak of _the_ Self but it does speak of _a_ self.  The 
way of the world (lokAyata) is to think of the self as merely the body 
apprehended through the senses and ceasing to exist at death.  From the 
karmakanda we learn that there is an immortal and imperishable atman that 
continues through many births.  It is in this sense that Vedanta treats 
karmakanda as a means of purification to prepare for higher truths.

I don't doubt it but it doesn't contradict what I'm saying about multiple 
levels of reality.

How then does he know that he is ignorant?

saMsAra, the cycle of birth and rebirth is the vyavaharika satya.  The 
creation, maintainence and destruction of the universe is the result of 
it.

We simply don't have enough information to make such categorical 
statements.  First of all, if we are even in a position to read mula 
madhyamaka karikas, it is because similiar works survived in Tibetan and 
Chinese translations.  "Hindu" works of that era did not survive whether 
due to invasions, neglect, eclipse by later works etc.  Second, Mahayana 
is not only different to Hinduism, it is a substantial departure from the 
earlier Hinayana forms of Buddhism.  I already mentioned that there was a 
turn to Sanskrit.  We also have evidence from archaeology that the 
Buddhists were becoming a demographic minority during this time period in 
India (outside was a different matter.)  So it is atleast plausible that 
doctrinal changes in Buddhism stemmed from an external source.
