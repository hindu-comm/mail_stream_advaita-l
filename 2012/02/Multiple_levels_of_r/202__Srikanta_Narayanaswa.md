Pranams.
Regarding the above,it is Jainism which is called the "Nirgrantha"school holds that reality has multiple levels of truth.It is called "anekanta vada"(syad vada)which is also defined as "sapthabhangi naya".According to this view,reality has multiple levels:"It is '"It is not","it is and it is not,"It is not it is"it is not it is not".But,Buddhism has only two levels of reality.According to Nagarjuna there is four levels of reality."it is ,it is not,it is not it is not and absolute existence".Buddhists say that reality exists in not clinging to any truth.The above view point comes close to "Fuzzy logic"in today's absract logic.
