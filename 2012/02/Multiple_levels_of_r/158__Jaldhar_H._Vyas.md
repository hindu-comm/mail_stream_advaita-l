Only becuse shravana etc. has already taken place prior to beginning the 
sadhana, through karmakanda.  (Which while explicitly dealing with ritual 
action covers all life actions.)

Well it doesn't mention it because you are starting from the end.  If you 
read my post from a few days ago, you know that 1.4.1 and onwards 
unmistakably describe Viraj as being ignorant of the nature of his Self 
and only on the passing of that ignorance He _became_ everything.

Note the word cessation there.

As I mentioned previously, Shankaracharya says Viraj's initial ignorance 
and then enlightenment is the result of His karmaphala from a previous 
life.  Is this not an alternate level of reality?  If not then what do you 
mean by natural exactly?

It does.  The whole karmakanda is dealing with a separate subject to the 
jnanakanda because that is a completely different reality.

There is a rather large difference between "originally was a Buddhistic 
concept" and "was used by Buddhists."  I agree with Shri Subrahmanian that 
the former has no basis. I don't mind conceding the latter.
