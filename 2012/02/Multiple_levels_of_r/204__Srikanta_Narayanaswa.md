It is said nagarjuna was the first to use the concept of "Multiple levels of reaity".But,actually this concept was started by the Mahayana school much before Nagarjuna.After the Ist Buddhist council under Kanishka,Buddhism was divided into Hinayana and the mahayana school.The Hinayana school held the "Sarvastitva vada" which says that all things exist.It is said that the "Mulamadhayamaka karika' was given to Nagarjuna by the naga chieften.
N.Srikanta.
