A friend of mine, Dr. Ramanujan, who is the Group Coordinator of Indian
Heritage Group at CDAC Bangalore, has produced a number of videos in
Sanskrit on many topics, including Advaita Vedanta, Mimamsa, Nyaya, Yoga,
Alamkara, etc. The URL is:

Click on "Video Lectures" (near the top)  and select the topic to view the
video.

The Advaita Vedanta talks are by scholars from Mattur. Also interesting is
a video on DarsheShTi and agnihotra conducted at the same place.
