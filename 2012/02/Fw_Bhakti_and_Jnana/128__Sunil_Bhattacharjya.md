Are you aware of Mahapurush Sankardeva, the great Assamese Advaitin Vaishnavite saint of that time, who wrote many works including the Bhakti Ratnakar? There was also another saint Vishupuri sanyashi of varanasi at that time. who wrote Bhakti Ratnavali. To tell you the fact that at time the entire North-east India was Charged with Vaishnava movement, both Advaitic and Bheda-Bheda. Any assessment of the thoughts of that time has to recognize all these influences.

I think Rajaram has the better of you in this particular issue. MS may have been to Navadvipa but in those days and even into the British period was famous as a center of Navya Nyaya. True their may have been some Vaishnava influence (Look at the names of the prominent Bengali Nayayikas, Mathuranatha, Raghunatha, Jagadish, Gadadhara) but the intellectual center of Gaudiya Vaishnavism was in Vrindavan where the six goswamis lived not Navadvipa.
