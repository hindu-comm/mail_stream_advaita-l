I think Rajaram has the better of you in this particular issue.  MS may 
have been to Navadvipa but in those days and even into the British period 
was famous as a center of Navya Nyaya.  True their may have been some 
Vaishnava influence (Look at the names of the prominent Bengali Nayayikas, 
Mathuranatha, Raghunatha, Jagadish, Gadadhara) but the intellectual center 
of Gaudiya Vaishnavism was in Vrindavan where the six goswamis lived not 
Navadvipa.
