I understand that the background is important as Lord Krishna himself says a yogi is born in a family of Yogis. If you think that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's ideas could not have influenced Kamalajanayana even temporarily,then may be we should agree to disagree on this point.

I have heard of him but I'm not familiar with his teachings certainly not that he was an Advaitin. What makes you say that?

Varanasi is considerably far away from Navadvipa.

I thought you are making a stronger claim, namely that MS was doctrinally influenced by the Gaudiya school. To say that there was merely a vaishnavish background is another thing.
