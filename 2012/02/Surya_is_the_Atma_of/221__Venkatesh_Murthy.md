Namaste

The Vedas are telling us 'Surya Atma Jagatas Tasthushasca' Surya is
the Atma of all. You are Surya I am Surya All this is Surya only.

That Surya is Brahman only. 'Asavaditya Brahma'.

We cannot find a simple and clear statement like this for other gods.
We can see Surya everyday. Why should we listen to complicated
theories?
