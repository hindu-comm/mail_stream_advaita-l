Namaste,

It is just an example of "shAkhA chandra nyAya". Everything is in YOU. Nothing
exists outside you. The "jyotis" called sUrya exists and is shining because
you see and perceive it so. Because, in you there is "parama jyoti" which is 
"jyOtiSAM api jyOtiH" which makes even sUrya shine. It should remind us the
shruti vAkya "tamEva bhAntaM anubhAti vishwaM".

regs,
sriram
