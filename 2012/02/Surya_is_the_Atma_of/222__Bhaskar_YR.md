That Surya is Brahman only. 'Asavaditya Brahma'.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

atharvaNi sUryOpanishad and taitireeya AraNyaka Aditya purushasya 
sarvAtmakatvaM mantra-s like AdityO vai teja, OjO balaM yashaH chakshuH 
says he is one and all and he is brahman (tvameva pratyaksham brahmAsi). 
But at various other places it says same thing to gaNapati also.  ( for 
example gaNeshArthava sheershaM) so, not only sUrya is brahman, 
'everything' is brahman :-)  In short, you can not treat ONLY sUrya is 
brahman by excluding others. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
