Namaste Sri Bhaskar

But Surya is easiest to understand. You can tell even a baby about
Surya and make it to understand Surya.

That is why I am saying Surya is the Pratyaksha Devata for all. Nobody
can deny Surya. How can you deny the Sun exists? Even Atheists will
have to accept Surya.

Veda is saying 'Surya Atma Jagataha' and in Sandhyavandane we are
daily saying Asavadityo Brahma.  This should be enough to show Surya
is Brahman and the Atma of all. There is nothing here not Surya.

Why should we go for complicated theories?
