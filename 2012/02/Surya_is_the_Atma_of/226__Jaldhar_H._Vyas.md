Because the complicated theories are true and the simple view is false! 
The Surya that we see every day is _not_ the Surya that is the atma of 
all.

Ishopanishad 15:

"With a golden plate is covered the entrance to the truth. That, Pushan[1] 
remove so that I whose dharma is truth may see it."


[1] "The nourisher" A Vedic sun God.

There is nothing wrong with suryopAsanA and many good reasons for it but 
this is not one of them.  I don't see how upasana on the sun is any easier 
than upasana on other mUrtis.
