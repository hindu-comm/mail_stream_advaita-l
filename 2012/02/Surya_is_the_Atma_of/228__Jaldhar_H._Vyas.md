Or for that matter many members of this list including myself worship 
Surya Bhagavan every day as part of the Panchayatana Puja.  My point is 
that the Sun in the sky is the murti of Surya Bhagavan just as Shaligram 
is a murti of Vishnu Bhagavan etc.  A person with difficulty having 
shraddha in Murtis of clay or stone etc. will not find Suryopasana any 
easier.

There is a discussion in the BrahmasUtras about whether the Devas have 
adhikAra to learn the Vedas.  (1.3.26-33) One of the pUrvapakSha arguments 
(1.3.32) is that they don't because the terms "sun", "moon" etc. only 
refer to "spheres of light"  But the siddhAnta given in 1.3.33 and 
specifically ascribed to maharShi badarAyaNa is that those spheres have a 
presiding deity who has all the attributes of personhood.  (and hence 
adhikAra)
