I think the name 'vishiShTAdvaita' stands for 'chid-achid vishShTa
advaita'. In other words, for Ramanuja Brahman is no doubt Advaitam but is
qualified too. By what? By the chit ( sentient jiva-s) and the achit (the
inert world of objects). Brahman's body is constituted by these two.
While in Advaita, Brahman is kevala/shuddha Advaita, it is as above for
Ramanuja.
________________________________________________________________________-
In Advaita,the chit and acit belongs to the "Vyavahatika"plane which is "Bhranti janya"The Atman itself appears as these along with the jiva.The word "Kevala Advaita "is another word for "Advaita"whereas,the word "Shuddha Advaita"is the word referred to by Vallabhacharya.
