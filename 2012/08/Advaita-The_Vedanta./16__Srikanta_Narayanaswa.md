Srikantaji PraNAms

If I understand correctly vishiTaadvaita is not the word coined by Bhagavan Ramanuja. It is the discription of latercommentators.

Thewordisused specifially the visheShaNa visheShya sambandha of paramaatmawith jiiva-jagat. In accounting the Chandogya statement - sat eva idam agra asiit -the adivaita is pointedbut that advaitic sat,according to Bhagavan Ramanuja,has internaldifferences or swagata bhedaas with jiiva and jagat as parts of that sat. chita and achit are considered as attributes of that sat, where internal divisions are accepted while the Paramaatma is antaryamin pervading both chit (jiivas) and achit(jagat) with organic relationship with the later two. avidya of jiiiva is not knowing one's depedence on paramaatma (sheSha-sheShee bhaava). Sharanaagati becomes a means for liberation with the recognition of ones dependence on Iswara and recognition of its role as service to Iswara. Knowledgeof this dependenceand surrender is the means of liberation - in explaining the charama sloka - sarva dharmaan....
Most of the purvapaksha in the Shree bhaashya addresses the seven untenablesof avidya as described by Advaita. 
I wasnot aware where Ramanuja addreses about the aagama prakaraNa kaarika part. 
Hari Om!
