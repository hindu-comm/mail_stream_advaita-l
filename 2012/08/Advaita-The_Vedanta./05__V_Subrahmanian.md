Sir,

Does the SrIbhAshya give the reference of the above verse as from the
Gaudapada kArikA?  This is because, for instance, the Madhva school takes
this and other kArikA-s found in that prakaraNa as the Mandukya shruti
itself.  Some kArikA-s from this parakaraNa have been cited as 'shruti' by
Advaita Acharyas too.  That apart, the term 'mAyA' and 'advaita' could mean
something else for non-Advaitic schools.  For example in the Madhwa
commentary the term 'mAyA' here means 'Ishwara icchA' and the explanation
is: jivas are in samsara because of IshwarecchA and come out of samsara due
to the same IshwarecchA.

I think Ramanuja believed that only adhyAsa cannot be there.
