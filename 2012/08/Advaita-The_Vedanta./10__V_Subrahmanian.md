Namaste.

Here are my observations.

I think the name 'vishiShTAdvaita' stands for 'chid-achid vishShTa
advaita'.  In other words, for Ramanuja Brahman is no doubt Advaitam but is
qualified too.  By what? By the chit ( sentient jiva-s) and the achit (the
inert world of objects).  Brahman's body is constituted by these two.
While in Advaita, Brahman is kevala/shuddha Advaita, it is as above for
Ramanuja.

Regarding this point in their system:

//4. Brahman is not attributeless – He is, in fact, ananta kalyaana guna
aashraya – infinite auspicious qualities. Nirguna is interpreted as
doshaguna rahitam.//

I would say that all the ananta kalyAna guNa-s are either jiva or jagat
specific and hence cannot truly be stated to be Brahman's svarUpa niShTha.
Advaita too admits of such gunas but as a taTastha lakShaNa of Brahman.
Only those guNas that can stand alone, without the need to be tagged to
either the jiva or the jagat, can be legitimately called Brahman's true
nature.  And that will be satyam, jnAnam and anantam. That school will not
accept this but this is what would be amenable to vichAra.
