I am not sure if this response is relevant to the on-gonig discussion. But,
it is interesting and eye opener for me, THought of sharing with all of ou:

I met a person from nomadic tribe community recently. he went to school and
got directly admitted to 7th standard. now he works in government service
in a very high post, written several books and articles, known for his
works on nomads and tribes in the country.

he made an observation which made me think "oriental brahmins are much
better than the mordernised brahmins. Modernised brahmins have changes only
at the surface level to accomodate themselves for the modernisation".

regards
Mythili
