I heard if a Brahmin man does not know his Gotra and Veda Shakha we
can treat him like Kashyapa Gotra and Rug Veda Shakha.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

What I heard is those who donot know their gOtra, can say that they belong 
to kAshyapasa gOtra and Apastambha sUtra, yajushakhAdhyAni. Even in hOma 
prayOga-s also normally we follow Apasthamba sUtra reetya agnimukha if the 
katru does not know his sva-shAkha. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
