Namaste Sri Abhishek

I heard if a Brahmin man does not know his Gotra and Veda Shakha we
can treat him like Kashyapa Gotra and Rug Veda Shakha.
He can do Sandhyavandana like Rg Vedis. Nowadays many books and online
information is available-

http://stotraratna.awardspace.com/sruthi/Manthras/m1.pdf  Achamana is
not properly given here. Give proper Achamana mantras.

Search Youtube videos also. Many videos are also available.
