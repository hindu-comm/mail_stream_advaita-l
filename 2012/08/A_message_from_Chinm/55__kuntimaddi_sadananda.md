The episode will be available by late Thursday night. 
The forthcoming episode highlights the rarity and importance of human birth and how this privilege is to be exploited to the maximum.
Concept:Glory of Human Life
An animal remains an animal and is bound by its instincts. Conscious self-evolution is only possible in human birth. It is only human beings who can break the shackles of body and mind and soar high. How to make the best of this rare human life? These ideas are dealt with in this episode.
Story:Tulsidas
Tulsidas' early life was filled with struggle. His mother passed away soon after birth and his father, considering him inauspicious gave him away to a beggar named Parvati amma. When he was seven years of age, Parvati amma too passed away. This made everyone around him look at him with contempt and people drove him away, however, he was fortunate to have married Ratnavali. Once when his wife went to visit her parents for a night, Tulsidas unable to bear the separation, reached Ratnavali's parents' home. Disgusted by this lust, Ratnavali scornfully told him, "If you had such love for LordRama, you would have attained Him by now." This changed his life and Tulsidas went to Ayodhya and decided to translate the Ramayana written by Sage Valmiki into the local dialect. Due to much opposition from the learned scholars of Ayodhya, he returned to Kashi (Benaras) and composed Shri Ramcharitamanas, which showcased an ideal Indian society to awaken the people from
 their slumber of ignorance and selfishness.
