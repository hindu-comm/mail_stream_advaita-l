To all participants on this thread:

Please finesse the number and size of your posts. If a post gets too big (more than 40 kilobytes) in
size, the list software holds it back automatically. If your posts stay small in size, but a number of
them are sent out on the same day, then it creates a feeling that you are inundating the mailboxes
of list members with the sheer quantity of your posts. 

This topic is deep and you would be doing your readers a favour, if you give them time and a feeling
comfort, in order to be able to take in what you have to say and to digest it. 

Thank you,  
Vidyasankar
