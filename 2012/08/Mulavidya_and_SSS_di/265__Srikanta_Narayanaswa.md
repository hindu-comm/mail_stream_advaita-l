The crux of the thesis on the "Mulaavidya"by SriSSS is that there is no 
Mula avidya.In vivarana,there is Maya in Brahman.It is true that the Jiva 
has avidya.The Manukya karikas by Gaudapada says:
anadi avidyo suptah yada jivah prabudhyate...
Hence,the avidya is in jiva.this has to be dispersed by realisation

Hare Krishna

However, to raise this jeeva bhAva itself, we need a kAraNa and that 
kAraNa is mUlAvidyA which is one with Atma chaitanya but anirvachaneeya, 
thus says vivaraNakAra-s. In short, according to this school, brahman is 
adviteeya and jeeva bhAva is adhyArOpita on brahman so, BEFORE this jeeva 
bhAva there should exist a shakti that makes this nonsense assumption, and 
that shakti is avidyA shakti which has the prior existence to jeeva bhAva. 
 Jeeva anyway suffers from tulAvidyA for which upAdAna kAraNa is 
brahmAbhinna mAya/avidyA. 

Anyway, shankara clearly says in geeta bhAshya that avidyA is not 
kshetrajna's dharma as it is the dOsha of antaHkaraNa by giving the 
example of cataract of the eye. Anyway, as you know these things have 
been discussed many times before without any meaningful conclusion :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Because of Maya,the jiva is born from Brahman,as supported by the "sruthi,Yato va imai bhutai jayante....."But the jiva which is engulfed by Maya as avidya has to free itself from "avidya".This is done by realisation.This is 'Mukthi"
