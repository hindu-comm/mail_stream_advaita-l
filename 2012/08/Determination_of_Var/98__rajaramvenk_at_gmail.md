Jabala was a chaste brahmana girl who just didn't know her  gotra. She had the son from her wedded husband, who passed away later. Many women in our family won't know sutra, pravara, sakha etc (even men). If they know what kind of conclusions you and even some commentators will draw based on that, they will go learn it first thing. Let's not draw conclusions that are not in line with the upanishad.

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Determination of Varna - Focus on Satyakama

Namaste

Someone can argue like this. Satyakama's mother was serving many
Brahmin Rishis and some Rishi placed his seed in her and gave birth to
Satyakama. But the mother did not know which Rishi because she was
serving many Rishis. It is not same as she was living with unknown men
and gave birth to Satyakama. She was serving Rishis only but not
ordinary men.  It is possible some Brahmin Rishi only was father of
Satyakama but we do not know which Rishi exactly. Satyakama when he
asked his mother she said same thing.

Satyakama's teacher knew this also. Satyakama must have a Rishi only
as father. He accepted Satyakama also because he was telling the
truth. It is not at all possible Satyakama was born from a Sudra man.
