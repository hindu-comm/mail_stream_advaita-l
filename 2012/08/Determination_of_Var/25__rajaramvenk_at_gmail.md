As I mentioned in my off line post, I'd like to get the sastric view on my questions from sringeri acharya or others who authoritatively represent the sampradaya before forming a final opinion on this topic. 

I didn't say that sudras or a-varnis are dull etc. They often have high intelligence. A brahmana  may be less skilled than a sudra, poorer than a vaishya and weaker than a kshatriya but have higher sattva guna  that propels him towards naishkamya karma and atma jnana. This guna quotient is acquired at birth. Jati is an indicator but not the only indicator or even the absolute. 

I'm changing the topic as those who belong to mlechcha jati may not be proud of their lineage though I think that they should be for they, before the advent of abrahamic cults, worshipped ancestors, mithra, varuna etc. They were condemned primarily for giving up veda karma. Those who follow all nitya karmas at least can  do so not me who does morning and afternoon sandhis in a combo deal and don't maintain any fire except the vaishnavarAgni :)

Once again I have been absent for a while and in the meantime this 
discussion has mostly run its course on the list though some discussion 
has been taking place offline as well.  I give the following responses 
only to tie up some loose ends.

Ajitji was specifically asking me for a historical perspective.  I agree 
that traditionally our thinkers have tended to view the entire social 
order as having originated in one fell swoop but even then one sees echoes 
of a different view.  For instance many jatis along the west coast 
(Including Shankaracharyas own Nambudiri Brahmanas) consider themselves to 
have been created either directly by or as a result of the deeds of 
Bhagavan Parashurama.  Now of course that Parashurama is the amsha of that 
same Shrimannarayana whose amsha proclaimed the Gita but you'll agree that 
this is a secondary srshti right?  And originally the example was given of 
certain Brahmana and Kshatriya jatis springing from the same ancestry.  I 
think it is in harmony with both shastra and history to suggest that there 
were some "primal" Brahmanas, (and Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras...) and 
others who joined them to make up the society we have today.

May I point out that I only ventured a guess based on the limited

Exactly.

Hey YOU asked MY opinion.  So I gave it.  If you don't want it don't ask 
me.  Then no one gets hurt.  Also I don't see why it is disrespectful or 
hurtful to note that todays acharyas have to operate under trying 
conditions nevertheless let me assure you no disrespect was intended.

They can't explain it.  jati Brahmanas, karma Brahmanas, guna Brahmanas -- 
it all reminds me of the Ptolomaic geocentric system of astronomy (which 
was also adopted in the Surya and other jyotisha siddhantas.)  He taught 
that the planets move in perfect circles around the Earth.  Of course this 
is not the case and it became noticed that the predictions of this theory 
did not match up with actual observations.  So the geocentrists came up 
with epicycles -- circles within the circles.  And when it still didn't 
fit, circles within circles within circles.  Finally Copernicus, Galileo 
etc.  came along and dared to say the whole theory was bunk and the 
planets move around the sun.  (btw. Today jyotishis use accurate 
astronomical observations.  There was no fight between science and faith 
as in the West.)

Before Shravana masa started I went to a shop to procure certain puja 
items I needed.  The owner gave my list to his employee and said "Bring 
this Brahmana the items on this list."  Isn't it funny how this 
congenitally "dull and tamasika" Shudra grasped something our panditmanyas 
have to tie themselves into knots to explain?

As horrific as the inquisition was (and it is a very black mark on the
Catholic Church) its long-term effects were negligable.  Review the
numbers and you'll see that conversions increased massively after India
became independant.  Why?  Could it be due to the fact that you and others
in this conversation think that Shudras are dull and ignorant by their
very nature except the fortunate few who you will condescend to provide
with a magic string to cure their spiritual deformity?  Make no mistake
that is the conclusion of YOUR varna by guna theory and this is not the
astika view and certainly not mine.

It is ironic that Hinduism prides itself on being the "most scientific
religion" when it comes to mumbo-jumbo about "God Particles" etc. and yet
the actual academic fields which are relevant such as sociology,
anthropology, and history remain virtually unknown to its adherents.
There is a large body of literature on religious conversions, how and when
they occur and let me tell you science comes to a different conclusion
than you.  It is the traditional minded and orthodox in practice in every
religion who are maintaining their numbers against conversion (include
conversion to atheism which is a bigger phenomenon than conversion to
Christianity or Islam.)

It is the loose, vague, religions that are losing the greatest number of
followers.  IF they make no demands on a persons loyalty they will not
receive any.

But this is the precise problem.  Your proposed solution is neither
practical nor realistic.  Now if you really believe your rhetoric, you
should be concentrating on the Hindus that are already here.  The biggest
danger to Hinduism is keeping its own next generation in the fold.  Both
astikas and reformers alike -- especially outside India -- are doing a
rotten job of it.  Early on in this thread there was some discussion about
how hard it is for vaidikas to get married.  These type of things should
be your priorities.  Chasing the tail of a few westerners who don't even
need that kind of help should be very low on the list.

These are fine words.  So why aren't you following them?  Unless I'm 
missing something, your conversion scheme is based on "My Guru says" not 
any kind of "scripture" (I think you meant shastra right?)

This yajuSha only talks about kalyani vacham.  Nowhere is it implied that 
the Veda is being referred to.  This yajuSha is "advertising" of a sort. 
The Rshi (Laugakshi) is saying "I am a speaker of truth and the Gods 
listen to me so I hope you will hire me for paurohitya giving generous 
amounts of dakshina."  (The "portion" of your translation.)

See Mahidharacharyas bhashya for the exact meaning.

Was there any doubt on this?  The
purana and itihasa are for all especially those who are Vedabahya or
Vedabrashta.  And tantrika adhikara is not (in most cases) based on birth.
Though it should be noted that their requirements are even more stringent
in many ways.

Yes Shankaracharya mentions the same thing even at the same time as he
upholding the restriction on learning Vedas.

I think Brooks is actually quoting someone elses translation here (its in 
footnote 50 on p.30 of "The Secret of the Three Cities") and it is not a 
very good one.

Earlier in this thread I mention that the rathakaras or jati of
chariotmakers are somewhere between dvija and shudra and they have the
right to agnyadhana in varshartau but not other vedokta karmas.  There is
another anomalous situation concerning the Naishadasthapati (King of the
Nishadhas -- not "tribal barbarian."  The Nishadhas were adivasis but
somewhere between arya and mlechha.  For instance Nala of the
Nala-Damayanti story was a Naishadasthapati.

Now according to Shruti the Naishadasthapati is entitled to offer the
rudreshTI.  Immediately after the discussion on Rathakaras, the Mimamsakas
take up discussion of this case (Mimamsa sutra 6.1.51-52) and the same
conclusion is drawn.  He has adhikara for the specific act mentioned in
Shruti but no others.  This principle is known in the dharmashastras as
rathakaranaishadhasthapati nyaya.

It is this principle which Lakshmidhara is quoting. The Shrichakra and its
swarupa, mantra, vidhana etc. is mentioned in certain upanishads such as
tripuropanishad.  In other words Shruti.  So normally the non-dvijas would
not have adhikara.  However it is specifically said to be for all.  So the
rathakaranaishadhasthapati nyaya applies and shudras too may do shrichakra
upasana without implying that they can do other vedokta upasanas.
