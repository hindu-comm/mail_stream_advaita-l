namaste,

Thank you for the link but I am looking for archival postings from Advaita_l more relating to Martha Doherty's actually dissertation than her paper in Journal Indian Philosophy. 


First Message:

Hari Om, 

I'm interested in archives relating to Martha Doherty's 1999 dissertation, A Contemporary Debate .... Avidya and the Views of Swami Satchidanandendra Saraswati.

Any direction would be most appreciated. 

Respectfully, Michael C.
