What is more important is whether the Sringeri Acharya approves Sri Raja
Sastrigal's activities.  The mutt might have blessed the Pathashala when it
was started.  Unless it is administered by the Sringeri Mutt there is no
control by the Mutt on the activities of such Pathashalas.  In the
circumstances it would be wrong to take the name of Sringeri or Kanchi to
endorse such acts.


Sometime back a person had asked me personally whether women and foreigners
were allowed to study the VyAkaraNa Shastra since it is a VedAnga.  I
checked with a very senior scholar of that shastra and he said that the
VyakaraNa shastra itself says that it deals with both Vaidika AND loukika
shabda prayoga-s and hence there is no bar on 'others' studying it.

For this curiosity of yours you must address a letter to the Sringeri
Jagadguru and seek a reply.
