I've seen many people, including sadAnanda, posting such things in many
forums. While at advaitin yahoo group his 'amendments to dharma and
shAstra' go without any protest because of posters having repulsion to and
ignorant of shAstra-s are dominant there; it is not same here. I'm happy to
see that at least traditionals are not barred to speak here. In this way
this forum is supporting traditional view.
