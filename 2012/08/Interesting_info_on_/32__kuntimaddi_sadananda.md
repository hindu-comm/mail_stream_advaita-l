Shreeman Ravi Chandrasekharaji - My praNAms

Frankly I am enjoying the Leela of the Lord as it is unfolding,which includes your comments. Please pardon me; I am not undermining your sentiments. Your visionof sanatana dharma obviously differs from theirs and I happen to concurr with theirs.I am reminded of Bhagavan Ramanuja preaching onthe top of his voice the secred matra that he learned from his teacher to everybodyto uplift the masses, even though he was told that he will incurr an eternal sin for doing that. What is dharma and what is adharmais very difficult to differentiate at times - says our scriptures. Obviously Ihave no interestin getting into such discussionsother leavingto His divine grace to decide and sit backand watch howHe operates - including the interesting responses tothese posts.

I just finished watching on youtube Krishnaleela movie as it was captivating and forgot myself completely that I have to prepare for the talk tomorrow. I am asked to talk on Krishna leela and will be speaking on Shree Krishna Karnaamrutam, an enchanting work by a great poet of 11th century, Bilvamangala Leelashuka. It is said that he was so involved with the experience of Krishna leelas and in the divine music of Lord Krishna that the Lord's musical notes expressed themselves in the poetic form. We will take a short glimpse of this divine beauty to let our minds soak in that nectar of Lord's leelas. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda





>I read this but it is against shastras to teach Vedic chanting (Rudram, etc) to those who have no vedaadhikara. These are Italians who are outside chaturvarna. Only those who have undergone upanayana ( Those males born to Braahmana,Kshatriya,Vaishya families). Even then, they need to regularly perform sandhya-vandana before learning Veda chanting.
