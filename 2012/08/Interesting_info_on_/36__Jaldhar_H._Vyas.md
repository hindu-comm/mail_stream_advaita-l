As for myself I am trying to pursue truth.  It was by no means 
foreordained that I would support traditional views -- in fact rather 
unlikely given my life history -- but I do so because for the most part it 
is the truth pure and simple.  Where the truth is in a modern direction I 
will pursue it there too.  But most of these reformer types are not 
satyavadis.  Like the proverbial ostrich who buries his head in the sand, 
when their pet theories are challenged they either retreat into fantasy or 
try and shut down the discussion.

Isn't it funny?  Vedanta is supposed to be the destroyer of delusion but 
these people favor it precisely in order to support their delusions.
