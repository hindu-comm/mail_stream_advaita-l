The Vedanga jyotisha of Lagadhacharya is obsolete and not studied by 
anyone except for the introductory half-shloka pa~nchasaMvatsaraM 
yugAdhyakShaM prajApatiM which is recited in the daily brahmayajna or 
during ShravaNi.  Jyotisha is based on the siddhantas which are actually 
mostly Yavana in origin!

What does jyotisha have to do with vaidika mantras?  Or are you talking 
the various navagraha vidhis which are based on tantras are they not?
