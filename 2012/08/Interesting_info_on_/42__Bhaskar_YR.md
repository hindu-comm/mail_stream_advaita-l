VyakaraNa shastra itself says that it deals with both Vaidika AND loukika
shabda prayoga-s and hence there is no bar on 'others' studying it.

what about veda & vedAnga  jyOtisha  then??  can stree & non-dvija 'study' 
it and recite the maNtra-s in vaidika prayOga-s??  A clarification with 
authentic quotes would be appreciated.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

PS:  I may not be able to even acknowledge  the replies as I am heavily 
tied with some official work.  So, thanks in advance for any 
clarification.
