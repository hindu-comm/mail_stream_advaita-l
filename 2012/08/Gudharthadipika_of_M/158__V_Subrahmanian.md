Sri Saha had sent this query to the Bharatiya Vidwat Parishad group
recently and I had replied thus:

This could be of help in determining:

योगास्त्रयो मया प्रोक्ता नॄणां श्रेयोविधित्सया । *
ज्ञानं कर्म च भक्तिश्च*  नान्योपायोऽस्ति कर्हिचित॥ (११.२०.६)

Three yogas have been instructed by Me for the emancipation of men.  They
are Jnana, karma and bhakti.  There is no other means apart from these
three.

This appears in the Uddhavagita portion of the SrimadbhAgavatam)

Also in the Bhagavatdgita 4th chapter beginning itself the Lord has said:

इमं विवस्वते योगं प्रोक्तवानहमव्ययम् ।
विवस्वान् मनवे प्राह मनुरिक्ष्वाकवेऽब्रवीत् ॥

स कालेनेह महता योगो नष्टः परन्तप ।

And सर्वे वेदा यत्पदमामनन्ति....in the Bh.Gita itself.

>From all this we can say that the Veda itself has the three-fold upAya
consisting of karma, bhakti and jnanam for moksha.  All these are to be
taken as One and not each as a separate upAya for moksha.

So, I think the three-fold division is already there, as approved by
Bhagavan, and that is the tradition all the Acharyas follow, including
Madhusudana.
