>From the ordinary understanding of these words,if any object is seen witout distortion in consciousness,it is nirvikalpa.If it is seen with distortion,it is Savikalpa.For instance,if "alum"is seen as a piece of sugar candy,it is "savikalpa".If it is seen as "alum",it is nirvikalpa.If the same alum is seen as say,"spatika",it is vikalpa.In,vikalpa,there are many ways,how the object is seen.But,in savikalpa,there is only one way.The world can be seen in different ways.There are many ways how thw world affects us.Seein the world as a "mithya"as it is,it is "savilpa".This "mithyatva'can be seen in the savikalpa state.When this state is transcended,one comes to the nirvikalpa state,which is unitary.
N.Srikanta.
