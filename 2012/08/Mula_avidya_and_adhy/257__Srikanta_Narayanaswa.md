The crux of the thesis on the "Mulaavidya"by SriSSS is that there is no Mula avidya.In vivarana,there is Maya in Brahman.It is true that the Jiva has avidya.The Manukya karikas by Gaudapada says:
anadi avidyo suptah yada jivah prabudhyate...
Hence,the avidya is in jiva.this has to be dispersed by realisation.
N.Srikanta.
