BrahmAshritA avidyA:

In the Br.up. bhashya 1.4.10 Shankara raises a question and answers:

In the Brih.Up. 1.4.10 where occurs the famous mahAvAkya 'aham brahma
asmi', Shankara while commenting raises a question: How can it be said that
avidyA is for Brahman?

And answers: *Since there is no other sentient being other than Brahman,
one has to conclude that it is Brahman alone, owing to ignorance pertaining
to Its own True nature, has assumed this jivatva.
*
And through the knowledge of Its own True nature, as 'aham Brahma asmi',
Brahman alone becomes liberated as it were.

This alone has been summarised as: 'brahmaiva sva-avidyayA samsarati iva;
sva vidyayA muchyata iva'.

See p.103 and 107 of Swami Madhavananda's translation:

Objection:  But is not ignorance out of place in Brahman?

Objection:  To think that Brahman, like us, is a seeker of liberation, is
notproper, and that is what we see in this passage 'It knew only
Itself...Therefore It became all.'

Reply:  Not so, for by saying this you will be flouting the scriptures.  It
is not our idea, but that of the scriptures.  Hence your fling hits them
(the shruti-s).   ...But owing to ignorance it superimposes on itself the
notion that it is not Brahman, and that it is not all, and consequently
thinbks, through mistake, that it is an agent, possessed of activity, the
experiencer of its fruits, happy or miserable and transmigrating.
