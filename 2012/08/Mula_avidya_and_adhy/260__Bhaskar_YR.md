praNAms Sri Karthik prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Has there ever been a time when you agreed with another member's 
conclusion?

Not even your "Guru" Vidyasankar's conclusions are satisfactory to you!

>  Kindly pardon me prabhuji, this is what exactly  I wanted to avoid in 
the discussions like this.  Yes, I do agree that myself and those who 
follow my parama guruji's teachings would be arguing against  other 
prabhuji's view points on this group.  But there is nothing personal in 
these disagreements.  Sri vidya prabhuji (yes, he is one of my guru-s, 
whether he accepts me as his shishya or not that is different matter) 
knows very well by back ground and he definitely wont take anything 
personally though I am expressing my doubts on his stand as he knows where 
I am coming from.  And for that matter your goodself also, despite our 
disagreement on various topics on this list, you are kind enough to clear 
my doubts through your guruji off the list ( like jayAdi in Rigveda 
agnimukha prayOga etc.), likewise Sri subbu prabhuji and sri siva senAni 
nuri prabhuji, Sri anada hudli prabhuji as well,  they are all so 
compassionate & helped me a lot in various ways.  So, I humbly think, we 
are not discussing these topics in this list with a personal grudge on 
Acharya-s, who we think opposing our/our guruji-s view points. We can be 
rest assured that these discussions are going purely in a friendly 
atmosphere without any personality involvement & names calling.   If you 
still think I am an odd man who is opposing each & everything in this 
list, kindly let me know prabhuji, I shall stop my posts on these topics. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
