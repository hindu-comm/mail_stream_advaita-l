Do you not remember the famous adhyAsabhAShya vAkyam:

//tatraivam sati tatkRtena guNena doSheNa vA aNumAtreNApi sa na
sambadhyate//

(this being so, the substsratum Brahman will not be affected in the least
by the merits/demerits of the superimposed thing.)

Such is the nature of Brahman.  The 'avidyA' that Shankara says, on the
basis of the shruti, that rests in Brahman, the ONLY adhiShThAna, can never
affect Brahman.  So the problem you have stated above will have no place.

Here is a reply from you to an earlier thread:

Bhamati considers this as a position that emphasizes tUlAvidyA and
jIvAshritAvidyA.

Hare Krishna

Sorry for the belated reply as I was busy with year end activities at
office.

Thanks for taking time to present the bhAmati position on jIvAshritAvidyA.
Prabhuji, kindly clarify is there any attempt in SLS to reconcile this
difference (jeevAshrita and brahmAshrita avidyA)  between bhAmati &
vivaraNa by Sri Appayya Deekshita??  Shankara clearly says that there is no
other chaitanya exists  apart from brahman and from vyavahAra drushti we
have to say that the brahman himself the sAdhaka and he himself realizes
his own svarUpa & attains sarvAtmatva.  Shankara further clarifies that
there is no dOsha in this assumption since  the shAstra itself says this.
 ( sarvO lOkavyavahArO brahmaNyeva kalpitaH, shAstrOpAlambhAt, na
hyasmatkalpaneyaM shAstra krutA tu )

You can see how after having accepted that 'there is no doSha in this
assumption..' as Shankara's clarification, now you are proposing that
Shankara's intention here is not at all that.    .

As pointed out at the beginning the adhyAsabhashya vAkyam takes care of
this too.  'aNumAtreNaapi sa na sambadhyate.'
