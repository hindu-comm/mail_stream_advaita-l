The concert is free for all I am including herewith the invite:

If you are in Chennai, love Carnatic Music, you simply cannot miss Geetha Vedantham. If you are in Chennai, are a student of Vedantha, you simply must be there for the Geetha Vedantham concert. If you are simply curious as to what Geetha Vedantham is all about you have to experience this concert.
