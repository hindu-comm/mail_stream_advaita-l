It is a dictionary of  biDAla = mArjala type. Except the dictionary is in
the telugu script
most of the explanations are given in sanskrit. Telugu explanations are
very sparingly used.
For a lay man it is not of much use. For a man who studied tarka it will
not be of much use
because he already knows it.
