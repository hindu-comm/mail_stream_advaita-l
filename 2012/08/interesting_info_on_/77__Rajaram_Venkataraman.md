it? Mere rudeness is knowledge. Please answer how Gautama decided the
gotra, sutra and sakha of Satyakama. Otherwise, please don't pose knowledge
of the sampradaya on this topic.

23 Italians were given Shiva Diksha in a Veda Patashala run by Sringeri
Mutt. They were also taught rudram etc. The mutt pays the salary of the
teacher and Raja Sastrigal provides food, accommodation etc. Sastrigal
himself is trained in a traditional gurukula.

Like Sri Shivashankar, these Italians have assumed names such as Sri
Shivananda, Smt. Saraswati etc. . If you think what Sri Raja Sastrigal did
is wrong, then write to Sringeri and Kanchi Mutts. He has their stamp of
approval.
