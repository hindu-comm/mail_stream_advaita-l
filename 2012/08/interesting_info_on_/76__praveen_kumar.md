Jaldharji,


I am surprised to read comments like your view,their view on an eternal
principle by an esteemed member.Can these principles vary from one person
to another?
Ofcourse it is a scandal that these people have assumed self authority to
do anything and everything they think it is their ultimate
aim of life.In essence,what these people are conveying is all those
pitru,rishis and deva gana have no role in deciding
which yoni/varna one takes the birth based on karma and guna and moves
along but which we take control in our hand and decide ourselves and
change!!!
The final question,who has to discipline such erring people?

Not this old chestnut again.  Ramanujas views on vedadhikara are exactly
the same as Shankaracharya and Ravi Chandrashekhara.  This came up before
in the megathread and I posted a link to his exact words.
See http://www.sacred-texts.com/**hin/sbe48/sbe48131.htm<http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe48/sbe48131.htm>

Sometimes.  But not this time.  It takes willful ignorance to misunderstand
what the shastras are saying on this topic.

To me this is the real scandal.  Not that other people are interested in
learning our customs but Indians are so uninterested.
