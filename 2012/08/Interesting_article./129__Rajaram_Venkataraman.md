 Actually there is one flaw in your theory Mr.Rajaram. Suppose we

RV: There is no logical flaw in the theory. It seems difficult to accept to
our rational minds because of its eccentricity. When Sankara disappeared
2500 years ago, everyone carried on with their business of initiating
sankaracharyas. They were hardly travelling and meeting each other, which
is any way difficult. So, they did not meet Sankara and Sureshwaracharya at
Sringeri who were discussing Vedanta and worshipping SaradAmbal. Sankara
had only disappeared from other's sight 2500 years ago. When the
kailashavasis called Sankara to come back, 1200 years back, he actually
went. Then Sureshwara also left after initiating like other matathipathis.
You can verify this theory by studying the life of Sureshwara to see if
there is any record of long life by Sureshwara.

RV: That is because Sureshwara was not initiating for 1200 years.
