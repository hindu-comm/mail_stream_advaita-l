A fine example of the ideal attitude in this respect is available here:

In the benedictory discourse delivered, in Kannada, at Mysore on 15.4.1988
by His Holiness Jagaduru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Swamigal, 35th Pontiff of
Sri Sharada Peetham Sringeri said:

In our Holy land, Bharath, persons in the Government, Advaitic
Sannyasins,devotees and people interested in the Shastras have been
celebrating , since the start of the current year, the twelfth centenary of
the advent of Bhagavatpada, the preceptor. Historically, 1200-1300 years
have passed since Bhagavatpada was born. If, following deliberation as on
other issues, a consensus had arisen about the year of Bhagavatpada’s
advent, be it 1200 years ago or earlier or later, there would have been no
occasion for dispute. Historians have so far not determined the year of
Buddha’s Nirvana with exactitude and certainty.  Yet, in 1956, the
2500thanniversary of Buddha’s Nirvana was commemorated in various
parts of the
globe.  Research has not established that Jesus Christ was born precisely
in 1 A.D. on December 25.  Nevertheless, the world over, Christmas is
observed on December 25 and the Christian era commences from 1 A.D.  Thus,
there are precedents for the anniversaries of events relating to personages
being celebrated even in the absence of historical definiteness about the
dates of those occurrences. So, the mere reason that 788 A.D. may actually
not be the year of Bhagavatpada’s advent cannot debar or render censurable
the current twelfth birth centenary celebrations.

However, be that as it may, it is intensely gratifying that the twelfth
birth centenary of that holy one is being celebrated. The present
celebrations provide us a special opportunity to think of and express our
gratitude to Bhagavatpada, who has done so very much good to all.

A similar question came up with respect to the Ramar Sethu.  While the
protagonists believe it is indeed the remains of the sethu built by the
vanara-s during Ramayana, the scientists tried to prove that what is seen
under the oceanic surface is a natural formation of things like
stalagmite.
