On Sankara, a theory, however eccentric it may seem, has to fit available data. There are evidences and tradition for Sankara to have lived 2500 years ago as well as the date of 8th  century. Most importantly he seems to end avatar in multiple places. My theory addresses all the data. No, I don't make fun on matters relating to acharya or tradition.

As regards Ram-setu there is no doubt that the setu was a natural formation and Lord Ram got the dykes made so that the army can use it for crossing safely. Valmiki mentions the different types of trees used to make the Setu, apart from using the light floatable stones like pumice stones and coral stones. It is on historical record that upto 1482 CE people could walk on the Setu. Lord ram got the Setu broken in Dhanuskodi (Dhanuskoti) while returning.

Jesus Christ ws born in the year 4 BCE and in the month of September. It was the political sagacity of the Roman emperor to order the celebration of the birth of Jesus on the day of the birth of the pagan god Mitra (ie. on the Winter Solstice day).

Your statement that Adi Sankara returned after 1200 years is pure fantasy. Or is Mr. Rajaram making fun of the date controversy?

In the case of Ramar Sethu, it is a natural formation because Rama lived in a different yuga. But it is considered as Ramar Sethu because of age old belief. A harmless ageold belief is itself a cultural heritage. That's how it was argued successfully. 

In the case of Jesus, his birthday is celebrated in certain Israel villages on a different date! Historically, it was changed to 136 times. The current birthday aligns with the pagan festivals :(

In the case of Sankara, I think he lived for 1200 years. After an active life of 32 years, he gave up his avatara body in the Himalayas but came back to live in Sringeri with Sureshwaracharya for 1200 years. And then again gave up his avatara body in Kanchi. That is why we see differences in historical accounts and evidences. If you think this is an eccentric theory, I can't help it. You have a normal mind - how boring.

A fine example of the ideal attitude in this respect is available here:

In the benedictory discourse delivered, in Kannada, at Mysore on 15.4.1988
by His Holiness Jagaduru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Swamigal, 35th Pontiff of
Sri Sharada Peetham Sringeri said:

(Quote)

In our Holy land, Bharath, persons in the Government, Advaitic
Sannyasins,devotees and people interested in the Shastras have been
celebrating , since the start of the current year, the twelfth centenary of
the advent of Bhagavatpada, the preceptor. Historically, 1200-1300 years
have passed since Bhagavatpada was born. If, following deliberation as on
other issues, a consensus had arisen about the year of Bhagavatpada’s
advent, be it 1200 years ago or earlier or later, there would have been no
occasion for dispute. Historians have so far not determined the year of
Buddha’s Nirvana with exactitude and certainty. Yet, in 1956, the
2500thanniversary of Buddha’s Nirvana was commemorated in various
parts of the
globe. Research has not established that Jesus Christ was born precisely
in 1 A.D. on December 25. Nevertheless, the world over, Christmas is
observed on December 25 and the Christian era commences from 1 A.D. Thus,
there are precedents for the anniversaries of events relating to personages
being celebrated even in the absence of historical definiteness about the
dates of those occurrences. So, the mere reason that 788 A.D. may actually
not be the year of Bhagavatpada’s advent cannot debar or render censurable
the current twelfth birth centenary celebrations.

However, be that as it may, it is intensely gratifying that the twelfth
birth centenary of that holy one is being celebrated. The present
celebrations provide us a special opportunity to think of and express our
gratitude to Bhagavatpada, who has done so very much good to all.

A similar question came up with respect to the Ramar Sethu. While the
protagonists believe it is indeed the remains of the sethu built by the
vanara-s during Ramayana, the scientists tried to prove that what is seen
under the oceanic surface is a natural formation of things like
stalagmite.
