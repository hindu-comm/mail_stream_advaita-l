Namaskar,

One doubt keeps lurking in my mind when this topic comes up. Suppose
we accept the dates proposed by Sringeri Sharada peetham, what
explanation could be given to the guru parampara of the other 3 amnaya
peethams which date before 788AD? Is it really possible that all those
acharyas before 788AD are fake or "created"?
On the other hand, if we accept 509BC as the date, as proposed by the
other 3 mutts, what explanation could be given to the huge gap of over
1000 years that would be generated within the Sringeri Guru parampara?
What happened to all the gurus in between this huge time gap?

Regards,
Abhishek Madhyastha
