Neither of the above. The true answer is that dates are shaky. In general, record
keeping about these matters and preserving them over time has not been a strong
point in the history of any of the Mathas or for that matter, in any traditional Indian
institution. The dates attached to the paramparAs have largely been derived in the
19th century and the discrepancies are because the various Mathas have all done
this exercise independent of one another. One should keep an open mind about the
dates currently being given out, without reading too much into their differences.
