The famous cosmologist Carl Sagan remarked that Vedic timelines closely match scientific age of the Universe. Stephan Knapp has taken vedic time lines and tallied it with modern time lines. 

That there was a pralaya before kali yuga is known from many legends across cultures plagiarised and popularised by Christians. But these pralayas were not intense enough to completely destroy the remnants of previous yugas. 

Scientific theories are based on pratyaksha and sambhavana. The value of science is in solving repetitive problems. It is not a good for reconstruction of origins as we can't see devas, yakshas and many alternate dimensions using scientific tools. 

In comparison, the pramanas used by vaidhikas is rock solid. It works for random events also. It also reveals adrsta space.

How do we account for this result of the scientific study?

//The geologist performed the exercise as instructed by the Paramacharya
and provided the results which was that the sand from the first location
yielded an age of being more than 100,000 years old whereas the age of the
sand from the second location in Kaladi was close to about 2500 years. //

According to the Hindu reckoning this Kali yuga is now about 5000 years old
according to this wikipedia article:

//*Kali Yuga* (Devanāgarī<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devan%C4%81gar%C4%AB>:
कलियुग [kəli juɡə] <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA_for_Sanskrit>,
lit. "age of [the demon] Kali<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_%28demon%29>",
or "age of vice") is the last of the four stages the world goes through as
part of the cycle of yugas <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugas> described
in the Indian scriptures <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_texts>. The
other ages are Satya Yuga <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Yuga>, Treta
Yuga <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treta_Yuga> and Dvapara
Yuga<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvapara_Yuga>.
The duration and chronological starting point in human history of Kali Yuga
has given rise to different evaluations and interpretations. According to
one of them, the *Surya Siddhanta<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Siddhanta>
*, Kali Yuga began at midnight (00:00) on 18 February 3102
BCE<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_millennium_BCE>
[1] <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga#cite_note-0> in the proleptic
Julian calendar <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Julian_calendar>,
or 14 January 3102 BC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_millennium_BCE> in
the proleptic Gregorian
calendar<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar>.
This date is also considered by many Hindus to be the day that
Krishna<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna>left Earth to return to
his abode. Most interpreters of Hindu scriptures
believe that Earth is currently in Kali Yuga.//

So, how can we have a river bed that is 100000 years old?
