Namaste

And by going the reverse way, in Parabrahman is superimposed the
Shakti/Maya/Avidya/Prakrti/Avyakta which is anAdi anirvAchyA.  And this
potentially becomes the nAma-rUpaatmakam jagat/samsara.  A few days ago I
had presented in this forum two instances of 'anAditva' of both avidyA and
mAyA coming from the Acharya's words.  The former is from the Kathopanishad
mantra 'utthiShThata jAgrata' where the opening words of the bhAshyam are
'anAdyavidyAprasuptAh..'.  And the anAditva of mAyA is from the Mandukya
kArikA 'anAdimAyayA suptaH. '     We can see the correspondence in the
description of both mAyA and avidyA: it is a suptiH.  A sleep where the
undercurrent is mAyA/avidyA.  Thus both are tamas. In Advaita this
shakti/avidyA is admitted purely for the sake of explaining
creation/samsara.  Shankara has explicitly said in another BSB that
'without this shakti Brahman will be unable to engage in creation.'  So, it
is a shAstrakRta adhyAropa in Brahman.  And since Brahman alone appears as
the jiva, it is again the shAstrakRta adhyAropa of avidyA in Brahman to
explain jiva's samsara.  This point is made clear in the Br.Up.1.4.10
bhashya (aham brahma asmi context).  So, it is settled beyond doubt that
both mAyA and avidyA are a shakti superimposed in Brahman to explain
creation/samsara.  The apavAda of this shakti comes about in the aparoksha
jnanam (bhUtaprakRtimoksham...Bh.G.13th last verse).  Thus the contingency
of advaita hAni will never arise since the shakti is admitted ONLY as an
adhyAropa.
