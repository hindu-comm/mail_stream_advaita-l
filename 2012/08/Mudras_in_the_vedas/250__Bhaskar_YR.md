Showing of mudrAs as a part of sandhyAvandana, though not mandatory,
is a good practice but there is no pratyavAya doSa in omitting that

praNAms
Hare Krishna

In devatArchana (during shankhArchana etc.) , in vrata-s & hOma-s ( during 
kalasha prANa pratishtApana), naivedya etc. we show mudra-s and do anga 
nyAsa, karanyAsa before prANa pratishtApana with beejAksharaM-s and before 
 rudra pArAyaNa also we do this nyAsA-s.  So I think though omitting these 
nyAsa-s & mudra-s may not attract any pratyAvAya, it is purely vaidik 
method even though looks like a tAntrika cheshta/kriya. I asked the same 
question some years back in shrouta forum, Sri Ganesh prasad prabhuji told 
me that it is required to show the necessary mudra-s during pooja, as it 
is more fruitful. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
