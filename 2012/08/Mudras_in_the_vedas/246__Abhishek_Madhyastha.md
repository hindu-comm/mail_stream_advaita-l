Namaste,

During the sandhyavandanam, few mudras are done just before the
Gayatri Japa reciting "Sumukham samputam chaiva........". After the
gayatri japa 8 mudras are shown as well. It is believed that these
mudras are known to cure cancer(arbudha nivaraka). But these mudras
are tagged with the title, "Avaidhika". Do the vedas deal with these
or other mudras extensively at any point? If so what exactly is
potrayed? Finally, is there a good book available which deals with
these mudras?(I'm a bangalore resident)

Regards,

Abhishek Madhyastha
