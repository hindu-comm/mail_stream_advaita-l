==========================

Namaste.

I am afraid that your are asking the same thing which is a pUrvapaksha
quoted in the gItAbhAshya:

ketchit tu panditamnyAH nirAkAratvAt Atmavastu nOpaiti buddiH, ato
dussyAdhya samyagjnAnanishTA ityAhuH...

 However, some wiseacres assert that the intellect cannot
comprehend the entity called the Self since It is
formless; hence, complete steadfastness in
Knowledge is impossible.

Am I missing something here? Please clarify.

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
