And if darshana means samAdhi, then there will be no word left to show 
that
Atman is to be experienced(द्रष्टव्यः).

praNAms
Hare Krishna

This is again a good point.  For that matter Atman is not an objective 
reality to say that it needs to be experienced only in samAdhi in the form 
of akhandAkAra vrutti.  shankara makes it clear that there is no prayatna 
(effort) is required to 'see' the Atman as Atman is our svarUpa.  What is 
required in avidyA nivrutti (na hi AtmAnAma kasyachit 
kadAchidaprasiddhaH...tasmAjnAne yatnO na kartavyaH, kiM tvanAtmani 
Atmabuddhi nivruttAveva says shankara somewhere in geetA bhAshya).

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
