Namaste.

Here is the support of the sUtrakAra himself:

69. Similarly Vyasa speaks of all the negative indications of Brahman such
as ‘not gross’ in the ‘Aksharadhiyam’ Sutra.


70. (Doubt): Combining and thinking of these indications do not fit in with
meditation on the attributeless Brahman. (Reply): Then your doubt is
directed against Vyasa himself and not against me alone.


71. (Doubt): As (Vyasa) has not asked for the inclusion of the forms such
as of the sun with golden beard etc., meditation on the attributeless is
not contradicted.

(Reply): Be satisfied with that; we also do not ask for that.


72. (Doubt): Qualities are only indirect indications; they cannot enter
into the true nature of Brahman. (Reply): Let them be so. Meditate on
Brahman thus indicated.


73. The Self is here indirectly indicated by positive qualities like
‘bliss’ etc., and by negative qualities like ‘not gross’ etc. One should
meditate on the indivisible, homogeneous Self as ‘That I am’.


This meditation doesn't create any new thing; it prepares the mind and when
it matures, the reality is intuited as it is. Which is nothing but vastu
tantra jnana.


As mentioned in one of the earlier post, if this system is wrong, then,
view of the sUtrakAra itself becomes shrutivirOdhi.

Did I ever deny that? I only said that there can be different paths to get
jnAnam. This method is mentioned in several upanishads and in the gItA too,
references has been given already in the previous posts.

This is the crucial point:

135. The Shruti too declares that with both *enquiry* and
*meditation*people know the Highest; but whatever in the books of
Sankhya and Yoga are
against the Shruti are to be rejected.

Absolutely, what else sri vidyAraNya, one of the most respected and
brilliant AchArya of the post shankara period recommend?

>shankara says in both sushupti and samAdhi there exists avidyA :-))

This is a misleading statement. Does shankara/Swami SS accept avidyA in
samAdhi obtained by the dhyAna yOga/adhyAtma yOga? If yes, please give me
the references.

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
