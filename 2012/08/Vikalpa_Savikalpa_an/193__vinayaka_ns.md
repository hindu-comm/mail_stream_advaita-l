=================================

Namaste.

This reminds me the following mantra and the bhAshya of the brihadAraNyaka
shruti:

manasaivAnudraSTavyam nEha nAnAsti kinchana|
mrutyO sa mrutyumApnOti ya iha nAnEva pashyati|| Br.Up. IV.IV.19

Through mind alone (It) is to be realized. There is no difference
whatsoever in it. He goes from death to death, who sees difference, as it
were, in It.

bhAshya:

"The means of the realization of that Brahman is being described. Through
the mind alone, purified by the knowledge of the supreme Truth, and in
accordance with the instruction of the teacher, (It) is to be realized.
There is no difference whatsoever in It, Brahman, the object of
realization....."

The aforementioned citation shows that Swami SS is not hostile towards
dhyAna & samAdhi.

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
