There is no mention of neglection of dhyAtR^i and dhyAna here. Only
Alambana of upAsanA is neglected here. These things make very big
difference.

I didn't expect it from you at least.
This is what I said :

*I don't say that nirvikalpaka-samAdhi is never talked in vedAnta-books. It
is actually helpful means to control viparIta-bhAvanA and hence is
practiced by all.
I just mean to say that the knowledge which is termed nirvikalpaka and
means of moxa is not same as the nirvikalpaka-samAdhi or the Atman shining
in that state.
I'll also like to add that such nirvikalpaka-GYAnam of brahma actually
doesn't need nirvikalpaka-samAdhi to gain birth.*

I think it will help you understand my position.
