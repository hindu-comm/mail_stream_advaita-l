Dear Sri Lalitaalaalita,

Note Sloka 26 in dRg-dRSya-viveka, by the very same authors of pancadaSI, i.e. bhAratI tIrtha - vidyAraNya, 

svAnubhUtirasAveSAd dRSya-SabdAv upekshya tu | nirvikalpas samAdhis syAn nivAta-sthita dIpavat ||

Compare with pancadaSI Slokas quoted below by you regarding the samAdhi of the citta that is steady like
the flame (dIpa) that is sheltered from the wind (ni/nir-vAta). What is merely called samAdhi in one text is
specifically qualified as nirvikalpa in another text by the same author(s). Furthermore, the mere usage of
the term "nirvikalpa samAdhi" does not a neo-vedAntin make, as I am sure you are well aware. (I am sure
you (and others on the list) are also well aware of the text jIvanmuktiviveka and that it refers to samAdhi
in great detail too.) Or else, one will have to say that neo-vedAnta is not so "neo", having been around for
at least 600 odd years, or one will have to re-examine what one means by neo-vedAnta and by nirvikalpa
samAdhi.

Here is a link to an old post of mine on this list, which has some points pertinent to this and other ongoing
threads on Advaita-L:

Best regards,
