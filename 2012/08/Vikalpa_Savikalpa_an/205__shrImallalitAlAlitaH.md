A person saying mahAvAkyam and antaHkaraNam, both karaNam of brahma-GYAna
confuses all.
vyApAravadasAdhAraNaM kAraNm or sAdhakatamaM is karaNAm. And I don't think
that more than one cause can be sAdhakatamaM for a kArya. So, vAchaspati
and others who say that different things are karaNa of brahma-GYAna are
opposed to each other.

See above. They are in contradiction. maNi was only showing you kAraNatvam
of one and karaNatvam of other in each case and not karaNatvam of each.

In short, I meant that vAchaspati-s view is ekadesha and wrong one.

sAxAt-sAdhanam is another name of karaNam. So, see again your sentence. You
are again using words without knowing meaning.

As you are a serious reader of bhAShya, I'll like to direct you to
br^ihadAraNyaka-bhAShyam-s and it's vArttika to gain clarity.
Anyway, the direct answer is :
vidhIyate just says that they are needed. That is justified in our case too
as we accept them for specific purpose, i.e. to remove viparIta-bhAvanA.
So, there is no need to imagine a new karaNa for brahma-GYAnam.
If you insist to accept antaH-karaNam as karaNam of brahma-GYAnam, then
from today count the number of pramANa-s seven instead of six.
There are other problems in accepting antaHkaraNam as pramANam. But, I hope
you will find yourself.
