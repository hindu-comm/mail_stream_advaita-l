‘The state of spiritual balance is obtainable by both the Sankhyas
(those whofollow the path of enquiry) and the Yogis (those who practise 
meditation).
He really knows the meaning of the scriptures who knows that the paths of
enquiry and meditation are the same’.

I dont know what to say to all these quotes, in short I'd like to say 
dhyAna is purusha tantra it may not fetch us the same result as vastu 
tantra jnAna.  shankara in tattusamanvayAt sUtra bhAshya clarifies this 
very clearly.  jnAna or paramArtha jnAna is not 'karma janya' or adheena 
to purusha tantra. 

And the next question that needs to be adressed is :  Is there multiple 
path-s to mOksha??  according to panchadashi, yes, if not multiple, 
atleast there are two ways, one is yOga (nirguNa brahma dhyAna) and 
another is enquiry !!  But as you know, shruti without any ambiguity 
clearly declaring there in only one mArga to the mOksha and that is jnAna, 
nAnyaH panthA ayanAya vidyate says taitireeya AraNyaka or purusha sUkta. 
shankara somewhere in sUtra bhAshya ( most probably in 2nd adhyAya) 
clarifies that the term yOga should be used in vedAntik context not in 
orthodox sAnkhya & yOga schools.  vedAntik dhyAna is something different 
from chitta vrutti nirOdha ashtAnga yOga dhyAna.  If the panchadashi 
recommending here sAdhana  yOga in the vedic sense or in adhyAtma yOga 
sense as elaborated in katha upanishad and dhyAna yOga in geeta, it is 
acceptable prabhuji. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
