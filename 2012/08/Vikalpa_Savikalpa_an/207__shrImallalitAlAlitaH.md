What is pramA here for which this vR^itti works as karaNam ?

Well, as you wish.

bhAmati says that nididhyAsana is dhyAnam or samAdhi. It doesn't say that
samAdhi is tattva-dhIH.
Instead it said that antaHkaraNa accompanied with nididhyAsana,etc. or
purified by them is karaNa for brahmaGYAna.
While pa~nchadashI says that after nididhyAsana mahAvAkya generates
brahma-GYAnam.
We were talking about this. Now see above your lines. You got deviated.

There is no possibility of six pramANa-s according to you. You have only
one, that vR^itti.
Now see your sentence again :
six *pramANams *will become *pramANam *through *vR^itti*(which is again
pramANam) !!!!???? (remember bold words have same meaning according to you.)

AtmaGYAnam is a pramA(sometimes we interpolate words pramA and pramANam
because of vyutpatti and vivaxA) and hence it must fit the scheme.
