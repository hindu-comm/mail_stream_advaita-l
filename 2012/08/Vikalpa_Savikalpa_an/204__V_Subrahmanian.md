I am aware of the difference between  करणम् and कारणम्.   I did not also
mistake your word 'karanam'.

I am stating the two views in Vedanta and how they are not really
contradicting each other.

No one has denied the need for Agama/shabda as a pramANam.  Only in the
work up to the final sAkShAtkAra as to what is the sAkShAt sAdhanam is what
gets to be viewed differently by different AchAryas.

The SutrabhaaShya that I cited itself is proof for the fact that samAdhi
(dhyAnam) is needed, vidhIyate, for liberating knowledge to arise.

*योऽप्ययमौपनिषदात्मप्रतिपत्तिप्**रयोजनः समाधिरुपदिष्टो वेदान्तेषु* ’आत्मा
वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यो मन्तव्यो निदिध्यसितव्यः’ ’सोऽन्वेष्टव्यः स
विजिज्ञासितव्यः’ (बृ. २.४.५) ’ओमित्येवं ध्यायथ आत्मानम्’ (मुण्ड. २.२.६)
इत्येवंलक्षणः, सोऽप्यसत्यात्मनः कर्तृत्वे नोपपद्येत। तस्मादप्यस्य

There is the clear term 'samaadhiH upadiShTaH vedAnteShu'.  The upadesha is
not something optional.  More than anything it is the view of the
sUtrakAraH, bAdaraayaNaH himself.  Even above that the Shruti itself holds
so. Otherwise he need not have had to aphorize so.  All the passages cited
by the bhashyam have the vidhipratyayaH.  The Ratnaprabha also calls it
'jnAnasAdhana vidhi' and Anandagiri also says this.  Sureshwara is also of
this Vedantic view only.
