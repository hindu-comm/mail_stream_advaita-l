If you are not talking about yoga-shAstra, then vikalpa, etc. will mean
something very different.

In case of vedAnta and nyAya shAstra :

vikalpa means prakAra, i.e attribute.

savikalpaka-GYAnam again means a vR^itti which objectifies attributes and
it's relation to something. As naiyAyika-s say : the experience pot has
three things to illuminate - pot, potness and their relation.

nirvikalpaka-GYAnam means an experience which illuminates just the thing
and not it's attributes.

When vedAntin-s talk about nirvikalpa or nirvikalpaka-GYAna of brahma as
cause of liberation, they talk about this division and not otherwise as is
popular now by the grace of neo-vedAntin-s and hindu-missionaries.
