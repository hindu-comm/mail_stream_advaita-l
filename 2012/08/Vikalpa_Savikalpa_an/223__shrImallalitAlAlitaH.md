The definition of nirvikalpa-samAdhi causes dispute.
How ?
As it is opposed to shruti-s :
moxe nirviShayaM smR^itam.

Can you tell me where sha~Nkara talks about different samAdhi-s while
explaining nididhyAsana and for what purpose ?

They say that suShupti and samAdhi are different. I've no problems.
While vedAnta-sAra-kAra says that this is due to presence of

kArikA says that the difference is due to laya of chitta in suShupti and
lack of that in samAdhi.
