This is the problem which arises when a person talks without knowing or applying correct meaning of a word.
The simple answer is that if mahAvAkyam is karaNam, then anything other including antaHkaraNam can't be the same. It can only be kAraNam. And I didn't oppose that anywhere. antaHkaraNam is a sAmAnya-kAraNam of any experience.

I can't see how maNi supports you.
Understanding meaning of the word karaNa is needed first.

Moreover, to add spice to controversy :

There are only six pramANa-s and antaHkaraNam is not one of them. Looking again at vedAnta-paribhAShA may help as I'm talking about pramA-karaNam and not kAraNam.

And,

The view which says that samAdhi(dhyAna or prasa~NkhyAna) is needed for liberating knowledge to arise is not of sha~Nkara and sureshvara. It is supported by vAchaspati who follows vedAntaikadeshin bhartR^i-prapa~ncha and hence is refuted by many AchArya-s including anubhUti-svarUpAchArya.
