Is not vikalpa also, in yet another context,  'options/alternatives'?  Eg:
एवम् उत अनेवम् इति द्वेधा विकल्प्य...For a samshaya/doubt, it is said there
should be minimum two alternatives: 'this or that'?

I have heard that this is also called 'अनुव्यवसायः’.  Will you kindly
explain this term for more clarity?

In Savikalpa samAdhi the dhyAna-dhyAtR-dhyeya
(meditation/meditator/meditated) difference is experienced.  In Nirvikalpa
samadhi this difference is transcended and the 'vastu' alone shines.

Here is a quote from the Book 'Exalting Elucidations' of Jagadguru Sri
Abhinava Vidyatirtha Swamiji of Sringeri:

Q:What is the characteristic of nirvikalpa samadhi?

A: The absence of awareness of the distinction of the seer, the seen and
the act of seeing is indeed its special characteristic.  The Atman is
clearly perceived.  Further, supreme bliss is experienced.
