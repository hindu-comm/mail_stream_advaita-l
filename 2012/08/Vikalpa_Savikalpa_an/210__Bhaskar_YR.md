I do not see any problem here as long as one understood that the patanjali 
yoga samaadhi is different from the nidhidhyaasana with knowledge gained 
from shravana and manana.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

But bhAmati differs here in the explanation of the shravaNa, manana & 
nidhidhyAsana sAdhana-s.  According to bhAmati (devanAthan prabhuji, if 
you are reading kindly correct me) shravaNa and manana means dhAraNa (like 
patanjala yOga's ashtAnga yOga) and nidhidhyAsana stands for dhyAna and 
darshana means samAdhi ( not a samAdhi in vedAntik sense, it is more like 
asamprajnAtha samAdhi in ashtAnga yOga, which sri lalitAlAlita prabhuji 
countered in his mails).  bhAmati further continues that the sAkshAtkAra 
that is achieved in this samAdhi would eradicate the prapancha sAkshAtkAra 
(i.e. complete absence of prapancha)  !!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
