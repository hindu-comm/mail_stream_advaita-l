Namaste

Advaita accepts mAyA/avidyA to be triguNAtmikA.  Tamas is one of the three
guNa-s.  The nature of tamas is explained in the Bh.GitA: mohanam, etc.
And parallel to this Advaita is very certain that mAyA/avidyA is mithyA, a
superimposition. [bhUtaprakRtimokSham cha (abhAvagamanam) as clarified in
bhgitaa 13th chapter last verse/bhashyam]  So, within the Grand
Superimposition, all the other superimpositions can happily exist just as
subsets within a set.  For that matter, even sattva as a guNa and its kArya
are mithyA in advaita.  The jnanam that a person gets, even of Brahman,
surely a sattva-guNa kAryam, is ultimately mithyA in advaita, for bandha
and mokSha are both only relative, vyAvahArika.  [na nirodho na
chotpattiH..na mumuShurna vai muktaH....ityeShA paramArthatA ...Gaudapada]

Since creation, etc. and all activities within creation, including
bandha-moksha vyavahAra can happen only when the Great Tamas is there,
continuing in its latent and patent forms.  That is why the Shruti admits a
'tamas' along with Brahman even before creation in pralaya and in sleep.
