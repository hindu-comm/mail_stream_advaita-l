Namaste.

The above is true.  If it is logically accountable/explainable it ceases to
be 'mAyA'.  But in the world ultimately nothing comes under the category of
'logically explainable'. Terms like 'mAyA' and 'IshwarecchA'  fall in this
category. Questions such as 'Why samsara for jiva-s?'  'what is this world
?' etc. defy a reply with perfect finality.  All schools of Vedanta have to
contend with these questions and offer a semblance of a reply to satisfy
the aspirant for the time being, until he grows in maturity to understand
that these problems/questions are to be dissolved rather than be solved.

The following inputs might be of use:

// 2. A snake must exist if a rope is to be mistaken for a serpent. So
also, the world must exist apart from Brahman if Brahman is to be mistaken
for it.

Answer: If one entity is to be mistaken for another, say a rope for a
snake, it is necessary that one have a knowledge of the superimposed
entity, such as the snake. This, in no way implies that a real snake must
exist, for the knowledge of the snake may be false knowledge. For instance,
a person may see a monster in a dream. It is possible for him, after waking
up, to mistake a tree in dim light to be that monster and to flee in
terror. This mistaken cognition requires a knowledge of the monster but
does not demand the reality of the monster. Since samsAra is beginningless,
it cannot be argued that at the very beginning there was only Brahman and
no possibility of any knowledge of an earlier world, real or false, which
could serve as the basis for the subsequent misconception of Brahman as the
world.//
