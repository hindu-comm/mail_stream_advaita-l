Namaste,
Shri Madhusudana Saraswati went a step ahead in saying that the greatness of Shivais due to the pAda-sparsha of Krishna only. Shri Madhusudana Saraswati in his*AnandamandAkini stavaH* says:
yatpAdAmbu vidhAya mUrdhani chitA - vAsaH shivatvaM haTAtprAptO bhakSitakAlakUTanikarO - mrityunjayatvaM yayaudigvAsA nrukapAlamAtravibhava - schAvindIshAnatAMsa tvaM nandasi yasya mandiragatO - nandAya tasmai namaH .......62
Shiva roams in graveyard which is considered to be an inauspicious place. But,inspite of his roaming in inauspicious place, Shiva is known to be the mostauspicious deity. It is because, He holds the ganges over His crown which is thepAda-teertha of thine O Krishna ! Because of the touch of thy pAda-teertha,Shiva could withstand the poison (kAlakUTa visha) and is able to hold in his throatand is known to be mrityunjaya (conquerer of death); even though roams nakedwithout any clothes on His body and holds a human skull as a begging bowlis known as "maheshwara" ie., the Lord of Riches.
If just by the touch of thy foot, ganges is able to bestow such a grace to Lord Shiva,how great would have been your father Nanda of gOkula !!
This is the bhAva of the above sloka.
regs,sriram
