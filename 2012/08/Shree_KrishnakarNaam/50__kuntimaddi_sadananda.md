Yes Sarma gaau - 
The potana bhagavatam slokas are so enchanting that too in the metrical forms that he presented, it is indeed difficult to describe those other than be immersed in their beauty as picturized. 
Yes I am aware of that he was shivabhakta while divinely beautiful sloaks came out from his pen - nay as he says - palikincedu vaadu ramabhadrundata - Lord Rama expressed himself through his mind. 
Same goes with Mukundamaala of Kulasekhara Alwar.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
