Pranams
I found this speech to be very illustrative of many principles we talk about but seldom seem to be able to put into practice.
One is reminded of Krishna's words from the Gita:

advesta sarva-bhutanam maitrah karuna eva ca nirmamo nirahankarah sama-duhkha-sukhah ksami 
santustah satatam yogi yatatma drdha-niscayah mayy arpita-mano-buddhir yo mad-bhaktah sa me priyah

My salutations to the speakers spirit and fortitude.

Hari OM
Shyam
