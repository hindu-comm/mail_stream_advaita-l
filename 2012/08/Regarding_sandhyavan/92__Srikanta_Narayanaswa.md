There is also vedanta book house in chamrajpet, Bangalore. (Opposite
to uma theater), where you get books and material on religious
traditions.

Regarding the difference between yajur veda and rig veda
sandhyavandana it depends on which sutra you belong. There is also a
subtle difference between the aapasthamba and bodhayana sutras within
yajur veda itself.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Though the sutra may differ,it will not harm to the way the sankalpa and the general rules of the sandhyavandana mantras.Normally,the "Aapasthambha"sutra is followed.As far as the "Bodhayana"sutras are concerned,it is rather elaborate and all the sutras are not followed by most of the "Yajurvedins".
