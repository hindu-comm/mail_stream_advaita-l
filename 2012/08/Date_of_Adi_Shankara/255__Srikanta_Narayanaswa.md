Apart from the various dates proposed,the only guide we have is based on the 'Bhashyas'of
Sri Shankara.I his Bhashya o "Brahmasutra"he quotes a sentence from the "Alambana Pareeksha"of Dignaga of the vijnanavadi Buddhism:"Yad antar jneyarupam tad Bahirvad avabhasate".Dignaga lived in the *8th century A.D".He belonged to Kanchipuram.Therefore,Adi Shankara belonged to that period.
N.Srikanta.
