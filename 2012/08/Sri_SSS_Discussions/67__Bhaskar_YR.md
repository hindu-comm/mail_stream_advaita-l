All
others who, too, are naturally affiliated to Advaita/Shankara and hold
views opposed to Shankara/Advaita/the later Acharyas, are in one way or 
the
other influenced by the views of Nagesha/VijnAna bhikshu.

IMHO, this is somewhat a sweeping statement without completely verifying 
Sri SSS stand.  Sri SSS himself in vedAntins' meet (published by 
kAryalaya, it's a collection of objections raised on the  VPP, MVN, sugama 
by other advaita scholars   and the reply to those objections  by Sri SSS) 
 explains comprehensively how his stand differs from that of Sri Nagesha 
bhatta.  Infact Sri SSS raises some objections to Sri Nagesha bhatta's 
stance. 

Moreover, if we say whoever opposes the views of later Achartyas ( 
vyAkhyAnakAra-s in vivaraNa & bhAmati) have been influenced by nagesha & 
vijnAna bhikshu, we have to say the popular advaita teachers of advaita 
vedAnta from Arsha vidyA (like dayAnanda saraswati, paramArthananda, 
Michel comans etc.) too have been influenced by vijnAna bhikshu's vAda or 
some other advaita vedAntin's vAda (who ofcourse naturally follows 
shankara/advaita) since they are against to the mandatory requirement of 
'nirvikalpa samAdhi' anubhava in advaita vedAnta.

IMO, to keep this proposed discussion more objective, participants have to 
desist themselves from judging who influenced by whom etc. let them focus 
their discussion on the philosophical stand and related matters.  Hope 
everyone would agree to this.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
