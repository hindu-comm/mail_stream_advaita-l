Dear Subhanu and Michael,

You could of course choose to discuss off-list, but at this point of time, I would encourage you to have a
discussion on this list, if you feel like having one! It would be a welcome return to talking about finer points
of philosophy, in lieu of the topics that currently seem to occupy everybody's attention here. Given that we
have not particularly had a discussion of Martha Doherty's paper/thesis here, it would perhaps be apt to do
so now.

And right at the outset, I would like to add an ADMIN note to all list members, to allow such a discussion to
proceed in a courteous manner, so as to generate more light than heat. At one point of time, this list had a
good philosophical focus, perhaps too academically so. Nowadays, however, discussions are very light on
philosophical content and a preoccupation with factors that are extraneous at worst or preparative at best
has taken over. I would like to steer it back to fulfilling the reasons why we set up this list in the first place.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
