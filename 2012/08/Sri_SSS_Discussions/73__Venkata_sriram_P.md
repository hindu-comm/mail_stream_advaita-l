Dear Ramesam ji,



Thank you for the beautiful article on 

how to be awake to the“thought of deep sleep”.




This seems to match to thetechnique ofenquiry mentionedby traditional advaita itself

as mentioned in muNDaka upa. vAkya:



praNavO dhanuH sharOhyAtmA

brahma tallakSya muchyatE

aprmattEna vEddhavyaM

sharavat tanmayO bhavEt




In the above mantra, technique ofpraNava vichAra mArgais prescribed.




praNava is adopted for two paths ie.,one for upAsana andanother is for vichAra.The former is kartru-tantra and

the later is vastu-tantra.




In the vichAra mArga which is vastu-tantrAtmaka, 

praNava is considered as the bow;the chidAbhAsa jivais considered as arrow.The target at which the arrow

to be released is Brahman.





The vichAra prakriya adopted is theprocess of enquiry only.




So, it is not that traditional advaitatreads a tortuous
path butit takesinto consideration the *adhikAra* of the mumukSu.




Regs,

Sriram
