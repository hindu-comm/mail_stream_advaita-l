Dear Sriram Garu,

Thank you for the kind words.

What you say in your concluding note (Quote: So, it is not that traditional advaita treads a tortuous
path but it takes into consideration the *adhikAra*  of the mumukSu.) is very true.

I do not know how or by whoman approach was christened*Direct Path*. But IMHO,it may notperhaps have been their intentionto callany other approachto be*tortuous.*

warm regards,
ramesam

Dear Ramesam ji,

Thank you for the beautiful article on how to be awake to the“thought of deep sleep”.

This seems to match to thetechnique ofenquiry mentionedby traditional advaita itself
as mentioned in muNDaka upa. vAkya:

***********snip************

So, it is not that traditional advaitatreads a tortuous
path butit takesinto consideration the *adhikAra* of the mumukSu.
