I am in agreement with this.  In the post-Shankara scenario other schools
such as vishishtadvaita and dvaita have charged that Advaita is influenced
by Bauddha thought.  This they did since they felt that the Upanishads do
not naturally give rise to the kind of Advaita that Shankara established.
It fell upon the shoulders of Advaitins to refute this charge.  In the same
way Polagam Rama Sastry has shown that those who oppose mUlAvidyA, etc. are
influenced by some 'thought' that has existed for long.  There is also a
view that Vedanta thought is influenced strongly by the sAnkhya thought.
In all these cases it is pertinent to note that no one has said that one
thought has 'totally' influenced the other; there are 'partial' agreements
between two systems.  Such instances are what are highlighted.
