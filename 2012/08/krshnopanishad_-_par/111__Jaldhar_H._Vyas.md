"In the ocean of curds spilled from pots broken when He stole them from 
the houses[1], He plays becoming a child, as he formerly played in the 
Great Ocean of Curds."

[1] This is a reference to the story told in Bhagavata 10.8.28 onwards.

"Maheshvara became His sword bright as flame[2]  Kashyapa[3] became the 
mortar and Aditi[4] the rope.[5]"

[2] But wasn't it already said that Shiva Bhagavan became His flute?  The 
editor explains that Shiva Bhagavan in His saumya rupa became the flute 
and His ugra rupa (i.e. Bhairava) the sword.

[3] Kashyapa Prajapati is the father of all kinds of beings through his 
many wives.

[4] For instance his wife Aditi is the mother of the Devas who are 
therefore called Adityas.

[5] The ulukhala is a big stone mortar which is used to grind grain into 
flour by being twirled around with an attached rope.

"To defeat the enemies, protect the world and to give mercy to all 
living things, their[6] son Dharma[7] dwells here."

[6] i.e. Kashyapa and Aditi.

[7] i.e. Krishna Bhagavan the embodiment of Dharma.  The meaning is 
although he is not a Deva or any other created being, Krishna Bhagavan has 
taken on a material form for the three purposes listed above.

yatsR^iShTamIshvareNAsItachchakraM brahmarUpadhR^ik |
vaijayantI cha vAyushcha sa paraM dharmasaMGYitaH || 22 ||

"Who has created Ishvara that chakra is the embodied Veda.[8]  And the 
Vaijayanti[9] and the wind carry the fragrance of Dharma."

[8] The seeds of creation come from the sparks from Vishnu Bhagavans' 
Sudarshana chakra.  Thus even Ishvara -- God as creator -- is subordinate 
to the supreme Brahman who is known from the Vedas.

[9] The Vaijayanti Mala is the garland worn by Vishnu Bhagavan.

chhatraM tu khaM cha saMviddhi binduvatsarvamUrdhani |

"The sky is to be known as His umbrella though it is as insignificant as 
an anusvara on a letter to him.  The Gods named above are known to the 
wise..."

namanti devarUpebhya evamAdirna saMshayaH |

"...as not different to Him there is no doubt.  Kalika the destroyer of 
all enemies became His club."

"The Sharnga bow is his own Maya and His arrow is all-devouring Time[10].
The seeds of billions of worlds are by His lila contained in the flower He 
holds in His hand."

[10] Or Death which inevitably comes to all the beings bound by Time.

garuDo vaTabhANDIraH sudamA nArado munIH |
vR^indA bhaktiH prIyA buddhiH sarvajantuprakAshinI || 26 ||

"Garuda became the vata tree named Bhandira[11], Sudama is Narada 
Muni[12]. Vrnda[13] is Bhakti and the Beloved[14] is intelligence[15] that 
illuminates all beings.

[11] Or Bhandarika.  See Bhagavata 10.18

[12] But earlier in shloka 17 it was said that peacefulness is Sudama.

[13] i.e. Tulasi

[14] Is this a reference to Radha?  Nowhere in the Bhagavata is the name 
of Radha actually mentioned, only in oblique references like this.

[15] Buddhi.

tasmAnna bhinnA etAstA Abhirbhinno na vai vibhuH |

"All these various forms are to be understood as non-different from Him.
All of the inhabitants of svarga and Vaikuntha descended to the Earth with 
Him."
