vaMshastu bhagavAnrudraH shR^iMgamindraH sakhA surAH |
gokulavanaM vaikuNThaM tApasAstatra te drumAH || 10 ||

"Bhagavan Rudra became His[1] flute and Indra His horn. The Gods His 
friends and Vaikuntha became Gokula and the surrounding forests and the 
tapasvis[2] the trees there."

[1] Krshna Bhagavan.   I forgot to mention that the text has shifted to 
third person again from 9b.

[2] Those mahayogis who dwell in Vaikuntha because they have not reached 
the final mukti yet.

lobhakrodhadayo daityAH kalikAlo.atirasKR^itaH |
goparUpo hariH sAkShAnmAyAvigrahadhAriNaH || 11 ||

"The Demons who do not fear the Kaliyuga became desire, anger etc.  Hari 
Himself took the illusionary form of a cowherd boy[3]."

[3] Whatever the origins of this work, it is definitely not amongst those 
Vaishnavas who believe the earthly swarupa of Krishna Bhagavan is his 
literal real form.

durbodha kuhakaM tasya mAyayA mohitaM jagat |
durjarA sA suraiH sarvairyaShTirUpo.abhavadvidhiH || 12 ||

"Beyond the grasp of the senses is that Maya that deludes the world.
Even all the Gods cannot comprehend it.  [Because of that Maya] Vidhi[4]
became His stick."

[4] i.e. Brahma.

rudro yena kR^ito vaMshastasya mAyA jagatkatham |
balaM GYAnaM surANAM vai teShAM GYAnaM hR^itaM kShaNAt || 13 ||

"Rudra became His flute due to that Maya.  What then of the world? 
Knowledge is considered the strength of the Gods, yet He destroyed their 
knowledge in an instant [with Maya.]"

sheShanAgo.abhavadrAmaH kR^iShNo brahmaiva shAshvatam |
aShTavaShTasahasre dve shatAdhikyaH striyastathA || 14 ||

"Shesha Nag became [Bala]Rama.  Krishna is the eternal Brahman.  And His 
16,108 wives..."

R^ichopaniShadastA vai brahmarUpA R^ichaH striyaH |
dveShashchANuramallo.ayaM matsaro muShTiko.ajayaH || 15 ||

"...were the rks and upanishads[5].  That Brahman[6] in the form of rks 
are indeed His wives.  Hatred was the wrestler Chanura and Envy the 
invincible Mushtika."

[5] There are supposedly 16,000 rks (also yajush etc.) in the Vedas. 
(There is a lot of duplication between shakhas.) and 108 upanishads.  In
the Vishnupurana it says the extent of the veda is 100,000 rks which is a 
considerable discrepancy.

[6] Brahman can mean not only "the Supreme Being" but "sacred speech."  In 
fact this is an earlier usage.

darpaH kuvalayApIDo garvo rakShaH khago bakaH |
dayA sA rohiNI mAtA satyabhAmA.ahiMseti vai || 16 ||

"Arrogance became [the elephant] Kuvalayapida and Pride the bird-formed 
Rakshasa Baka.  Mercy was Mother Rohini and Satyabhama Non-violence."

aghAsuro mahAvyAdhiH kaliH kaMsaH sa bhUpati |
shamo mitraH sudAmA cha satyAkrUro damoddhavaH || 17 ||

"Mahavyadhi was Aghasura and the Kaliyuga King Kamsa. Peacefulness the 
friend Sudama, Honesty Akrura, and Self-control Uddhava."

yaH sha~NkhaH sa svayaM viShNurlakShmIrUpo vyavasthitaH |

"That shankha produced at the churning of the Mahodadhi, that makes a 
great sound like thunder, is to be known as Vishnu Bhagavan in the form of 
Lakshmi."
