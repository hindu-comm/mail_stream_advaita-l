Dear Shri Subhanu ji,

Thanks for your response.  Let me clarify that what I have cited and said
about creation is with the full knowledge that Advaita holds creation as
only a pratikalpana to remove the deeper ignorance about Brahman/Atman. My
thanks to Shri Anand ji for citing the very kArikA verse/s that I had in
mind on this.  On the same count even the thesis built up by Sri Swamiji is
not justified since there can be no adhyasa at all
from the Absolute standpoint.  In fact in the very first opening sentence
of the adhyasa bhashya Shankara raises a pUrvapaksha against adhyAsa and
says adhyAsa simply cannot be/arise.  And only later He talks about the
naisargika adhyasa based on 'experience', in the field of ignorance.

No.  The very talk of adhyAsa is out of the question if one is not
recognizing the sphere of ignorance.  In fact there is a serious flaw in
this argument involving 'instantaneous adhyasa'.  On the one hand  Sri
Swamiji is said to accept anAditva and on the other hand there is this
'instantaneous adhyAsa'.  The two are never compatible.  anAditva can never
be divorced of the concept of 'paurvAparyam'.  The question of an
instantaneous adhyAsa is only pointing to the illogicality/impossibility.

That is the given.  But on the same grounds there can be no talk about
adhyAsa as being instantaneous by someone who is said to admit anAditva.

Why? What about the Shruti 'dhAtA yathApUrvam akalpayat' [the Creator
brought forth things 'as they were in the previous kalpa']  And the shruti
' तं *विद्याकर्मणी*  समन्वारभेते पूर्वप्रज्ञा च [बृ.आ.उ. ४.४.२]which
teaches that the jiva takes the next life with the 'stock' carried over
from the previous life.  There are dozens of such passages and the bhashyam
to prove that adhyAsa is anAdi and a continuous process.  There can never
be an instantaneous adhyAsa in Advaita without a pre-existing stock. The
earlier adhyAsa forms the material for the succeeding adhyAsa.  This is how
it is held in Advaita.

AdhyAsa is also only provisionally accepted for the teaching of Brahman the
only reality.  So why make a thesis on adhyasa? Only after the
'abhyupagama' of adhyasa does Shankara proceed in the adhyAsa bhashya.  If
adhyasa is admitted the paurvAparyabhAva is inevitable.  That is the point
the various passages I have cited make.

True.  The anAditva of adhyAsa is inextricably tied up with the time
aspect.  the three gita verses of ch.13 as a set prove this.  That is why
Swamiji, I think, is making a very strange proposition of not admitting a
pUrvAvasthA for adhyAsa.  There can never be a 'first' adhyAsa and such is
the case Sri Swamiji is arguing for.

True. But not without the substratum of Brahman.  That is why Advaita,
knowing well Brahman is nirvikAra/niShkriya admits creation 'by' brahman
'through' the agency of mAyA. And the strongest thesis of Advaita against
the sAnkhya who desperately proposes the pradhAnam as jagat kARaNam is:
pradhAnam, being achetanam, cannot engage in any activity unless through a
chetana intervention.   The same is true with adhyAsa too.  adhyAsa simply
cannot come by itself.  ONLY to a sentient being there is the experience of
adhyAsa.  That is why the shruti talks about avidyA. So, in a sentient
being, owing to avidyA all the projections take place.  This necessarily is
within the logical 'paurvAparya' scheme.

I have already replied this:  Within the mega superimposition, several
superimpositions can take place.  The glaring example, advaita-friendly,
is: within the vyAvahArika there is the prAtibhAsika.  A distinction is
made between the two. In our experience too there is the case of dream
within dream and rope-snake like experiences within dream .

I thank, once again, Shri Anand Hudli ji for the valuable citation from the
Chitsukha on the true purport of the term 'bhAvarUpa.'  Surely this was
available at the time of Sri Swamiji.  Without quoting this verse I have
been giving out the very meaning of this verse in several posts over the
past several years.

A superimposed 'thing' can be the material cause of something.  For
instance the 'pancha bhUta-s' are adhyasta alone in Advaita.  Yet they are
the material causes of the pAnchabhautika.  The kshetram definition is the
best example from the BG 13th chapter.

The entire discourse of the Chandogya 6th chapter is about the upAdAna
kAraNatvam of  brahman and that is how the teaching culminates in
:ऐतदात्म्यमिदं सर्वं तत् सत्यं स आत्मा तत् त्वमसि..In fact even the first
three examples to drive home this point is about the clay, gold and
iron..all as upAdAna (material cause) only and not of the nimitta
naimittika type.  I am really shocked by the above observation of yours.

I agree that we always end up agreeing to disagree :-)
