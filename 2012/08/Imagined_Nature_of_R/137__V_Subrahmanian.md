I wish to make the following points:


   - It is true that the root ignorance (mUlAvidyA) has been admitted to be
   adhyasta by the post-Shankara Acharyas.  'adhyastatvenaiva svIkRtA'.
   - In fact Sri SSS too has not been able to do away with a state prior to
   adhyAsa:  He says in the reply to a scholar who objected to his views:  *//
   adhyAsa*, of course, presupposes ignorance or want of true knowledge.
   But this is a logical presupposition, a necessary implication of thought.
   No positive entity like the unfortunate *MUlAvidyA* can claim precedence
   in time over *adhyAsa; *for, as already said, time itself is its
   product. vedAnta which predicates the unity of *brahman* will be
   shattered to pieces, if a second entity not subjected to or originating
   from *adhyAsa* be for a moment conceded to exist. The reality of the
   not-self (*anAtman) *follows necessarily from its not being
*adhyAsa, *superimposed.
   I submit this vital aspect of the system to the learned Professor for his
   deep consideration.//


   From the above it is clear that Sri SSS admits of an ignorance
   presupposing *adhyAsa*. It is also clear, from the concluding remarks
   above, that he has, erroneously, equated the *bhAvarUpa* status of *
   mUlAvidyA* with the Reality of *brahman*. He says that accepting a
   condition of ignorance prior to superimposition is *a logical
   presupposition, a necessary implication of thought. *What prevents him
   from extending this privilege of logical necessity to the Acharyas who have
   found it necessary to posit a condition preceding *adhyAsa* and naming
   it '*mUlAvidyA*'? It would be pertinent to examine how and in what ways
   is the *'want of knowledge' or 'j~nAna abhAva'* as his followers term
   it, is different in kind from the *mUlAvidyA* that SSS opposes
   vehemently.  (Please read more
here:http://advaita-academy.org/talks/An-Appraisal-of-SSS-views-%283-of-3%29.ashx


   <http://advaita-academy.org/talks/An-Appraisal-of-SSS-views-%283-of-3%29.ashx>
   - A 'jnAnAbhAvaH' preceding adhyAsa, in Sri SSS's scheme will also have
   the same 'yoga-kShema' as the 'mUlAvidyA'.  If he says the latter will hit
   Advaita in its roots, the jnAnAbhAva proposed by Sri SSS too will do the
   same.  If it is said 'jnAnAbhAva' will be sublated/destroyed along with
   adhyAsa/samsAra upon samyagjnAnam, the same is the reply with regard to
   mulAvidyA.  There is no way that one can insist that the 'prior-to-adhyAsa
   condition of jnAnAbhAva' will not do any damage to Advaita but the
   mUlAvidyA alone will.'
   - In other words, even Sri SSS cannot escape his charge against his
   opponent quoting the BSB II.ii.17 “avidyāmānārtha-kalpanāyām
   sarvārthasiddhi-prasangāt ..”etc, ie if you are prepared to assume the
   existence of something that doesn’t exist you can prove whatever you like.'
   - The appeal to the shrutyanugRhIta tarka too will only be strengthening
   the view of Sr SSS's opponent:  In respect to Atma anubhava, Shankara
   invokes 'everyone experiences that 'I exist'; no one experiences 'I do not
   exist' to prove the 'natural' anubhavasiddha nature of Atman and goes on to
   reiterate the need for brahmajignAsA for ONLY the shruti can teach what
   this Atman* is in truth*; that is free of all avidyA-born upAdhis,
   which, however, is not within everyone's experience.  This same logic can
   be stated in the case of adhyAsa too: everyone has the experience of the
   dehAdi-adhyAsa (kArya avidyA/adhyAsa) but only shruti can point to the
   'root' (kAraNa avidyA/adhyAsa) of this adhyAsa.

As I said earlier, the mUlAvidyA is admitted only as a superimposed entity
and not a real entity as Sri SSS has mistaken.  It is surely a shAstrakRta
adhyAropa and will face apavAda thru samyagjnAnam.

The reason is not far to seek and not unknown to Sri SSS either.  Just as
he, as cited by me in the foregoing, finds it inevitable to admit a prior
avasthA to adhyAsa by naming it 'jnAnAbhAvaH', the vivaraNa prasthAna too
admits a prior state of adhyAsa.

Sri SSS is also not free from such an inconsistency, if he insists  that
charge against his opponent.

The 'jnAnAbhAva' admitted by him as a condition prior to and causing
adhyAsa too has to be admitted by him as beginningless.  For, even he
cannot specify as to when in time this jnAnAbhava appeared from nowhere to
cause adhyAsa and the samsara. If he leaves it as it is, there will be
advaita hAniH.

In fact this very objection hits back on the objector:  The 'jnAnAbhAva'
that is admitted as a condition prior to adhyAsa has to exist somewhere.
What is that locus?  It has to be the mind.  For only for someone who has
jnAnAbhAva the subsequent adhyAsa occurs.  It cannot be simply wished away
by saying: 'just because of jnAnAbhAva, adhyAsa occurs.'  Just like it has
to be, per force, admitted that this jnAnAbhAva that Sri SSS has admitted
is only a superimposition, so too the root ignorance is.  The other
alternative suggested in the above paragraph will not operate since it is
admitted in the vivarana prasthanam that such a causal ignorance is also a
superimposed alone.  The only answer to this 'trap' is: this anirvAchyA
shaktiH is capable of bringing about the impossible: it can bring about a
mind and find a locus for itself and yet cause the further series of
adhyAsa-samsara.  The Advaita Siddhi quotes this (Brahmabindu upanishad?):

svenaiva kalpite deshe vyomni yadvat ghaTAdikam
tathA jIvAshritaavidyAM manyante jnAnakovidAH

Just as jars etc. 'find' a place for themselves to exist by creating a
place for themselves in space,  so too is the case with the avidyA that is
located in the jIva. Such is the conclusion of the Wise.

AvidyA can create a locus for itself to occupy and operate from. That is
why avidyA is called 'vichArAsaha'; it cannot stand the test of enquiry.
Sureshwara gives the example of a berry placed on the tip of the nose - so
precarious is avidyA's existence; yet its power is unimaginable.  Logical
answers to questions regarding avidyA/mAyA/samsAra etc., is never available
in any school.

This charge applies with equal force to the 'jnAnAbhAvaH' that Sri SSS
admits as a condition that prevails prior to adhyAsa.

All systems, if he is meaning the Dvaita and VA, accept a mUlAvidya; at
least the first one does, as I have understood.Just as he himself could not
escape this 'logical necessity' as he himself has termed it in his writing,
the later Acharyas too admit this.

I think the whole issue is akin to 'much ado about nothing.'

I wish to add that just like mAyA has been admitted in its dual-aspect
'kArya-kAraNAtmakatvena', so too is avidyA.  In the BG  18.19:
ज्ञानं कर्म च कर्ता च त्रिधैव गुणभेदतः ।
 *प्रोच्यते गुणसंख्याने* यथावच्छृणु तान्यपि ॥१८- १९

In the bhashya Shankara says // the 'categories' admitted by the sAnkhyas
are admissible to us as well, for even though their ultimate siddhanta is
opposed to Vedanta, yet they are 'experts' in categorization. //

Thereby they (sAnkhya-s) start with mUlaprakRti and go on to enumerate
mahat, avyaktam,  ahankara, panchabhutas, and so on.  One can see that the
first enumerated is the kAraNa whose kArya is the rest.  The rest will
lapse in to the cause during pralaya.  In the same way there is nothing
wrong in admitting a kAraNa avasthA for avidyA and a kArya avstha.  What
Shankara describes as 'avidyA' in the adhyAsa bhashyam is only the kArya
avidyA.  The kAraNa avidyA is denoted by the term 'mithyAjnAna nimittaH' in
that very document.  In the 4th adhyAya 4.1.19 Shankara talks about the
'bAdhita ajnAnam's anuvRttiH'.  Here even though the kAraNa avidyA has
undergone sublation, yet its kArya will continue for some time as it has
already begun to operate.
The 13th chapter of the Gita too admits the anAditva of the puruSha and
prakRti.  Here too the prakRti is admitted in its kAraNa avasthA alone as
anAdi.  And the purusha is one who is already 'endowed' with the avidyA in
its kAraNa mode.  The 'commingling' of these two entities brings for the
vyakta prapancha for the puruSha's (jiva's) bhoga.  Both these entities,
however, undergo sublation, which is stated in the last verse of the 13th
chapter: bhUtaprkRti mokSham cha and the operation of the jnAnachakShus
(right knowledge) which discriminates between the kshetra and the
kshetrajna.  The jiva is no longer there, along with the mUlAvidyA, when
the kshetram is negated and the knowledge of the mithyAtva of the kshetram
is what is spoken of as bhUtaprakRti moksha (abhAvagamanam) in the
bhashyam. Thus, bothe mAyA (the jagatkAraNam) and avidyA (the jIvakAraNam)
are sublated in both their kArya and kAraNa aspects, leaving the advaita
Brahman (Kshetrajna) in tact.

Thus the so-called 'problems' that Sri SSS has apprehended do not have a
place upon the proper understanding of the Bhashyam.
