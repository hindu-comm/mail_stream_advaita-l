The 13th sloka of kaivalya Upanishad also reiterates similarly as:

sushuptikAlE sakalE vileenE tamObhibhUtaH sukhaswarUpamEti
punascha janmAntarakarmayOgAtsa Eva jIvaH svapiti prabuddhaH

praNAms
Hare Krishna

And in some other shruti-s it is also said there is one & undivided entity 
before creation or in the beginning of the creation and that is Atman / 
brahman :-)  For example, this was indeed Atman 'alone' in the beginning 
and nothing else, sentient or non-sentient (Itareya upanishat maNtra Atma 
vA idameka etc.) and this was Being alone in the beginning, one without a 
second (chAndOgya maNtra sadeva soumya idamagraAsit ekamevAdviteeyaM 
etc.).  As you know we have to  do the reconciliation of these shruti 
statements without making the siddhAnta hAni.  Otherwise it is as good as 
saying  in the beginning,  brahman with the causal avidyA created the 
jagat :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
