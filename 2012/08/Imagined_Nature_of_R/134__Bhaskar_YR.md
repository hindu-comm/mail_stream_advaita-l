According to some, in deep sleep only the AvaraNa aspect of mAya operates

praNAms Sri Sarma prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Unfortunately there is no shankara bhAshya support for this statement. 
Since this state is an objectless state and the jeeva here is sarvOpAdhi 
vinirmukta, there is no posibility for the mAya to exercise her AvaraNa 
power.  Why we dont see anything in the dreamless deep sleep state??  It 
can not be  due to mayA's concealing power as there is no objects in that 
state, no question of concealing it by maya, OTOH,   it is because, 
shankara says yadvai tanna pashyati pashyan vai tanna pashyati na hi 
drashturdrushterviparilOpO vidyatevinAshitvAt.  Here in this state, jeeva 
is ekibhUta, prajnAna ghana hence does not 'see' anything.   However, from 
the other stand point we have to say jeeva enters sushupti without the 
knowledge of his svarUpa (jnAnAbhAva) hence suffers from jnAnAbhAva in 
sushupti and jnAnAbhAva, anyathAgrahaNa (vipareeta jnAna), saMshaya in 
jAgrat avastha.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
