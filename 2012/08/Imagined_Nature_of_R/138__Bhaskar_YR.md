>From the above it is clear that Sri SSS admits of an ignorance
   presupposing *adhyAsa*. 

> I dont know how this can be charged against Sri SSS, as he clearly says 
adhyAsa is what termed as avidyA and which is anAdi & naisargika as 
cleared by shankara in adhyAsa bhAshya. Moreover, Sri SSS is not saying 
jnAnAbhAva is the upAdAna kAraNa for the adhyAsa to equate him with 
mUlAvidyAvAdins.  He is saying cause and effect relationship itself takes 
place in adhyAsa which is naisargika & anAdi. 

It is also clear, from the concluding remarks
   above, that he has, erroneously, equated the *bhAvarUpa* status of *
   mUlAvidyA* with the Reality of *brahman*. 

>  panchapAdika vivaraNa says that this mUlAvidyA exists with brahman in 
the beginning before creation.  If reference needed from the panchapAdika 
work, I shall provide on Monday.

He says that accepting a
   condition of ignorance prior to superimposition is *a logical
   presupposition, a necessary implication of thought. *What prevents him
   from extending this privilege of logical necessity to the Acharyas who 
have
   found it necessary to posit a condition preceding *adhyAsa* and naming
   it '*mUlAvidyA*'? It would be pertinent to examine how and in what ways
   is the *'want of knowledge' or 'j~nAna abhAva'* as his followers term
   it, is different in kind from the *mUlAvidyA* that SSS opposes
   vehemently

>  it is because mUlAvidyAvAins say this mUlAvidyA is neither jnAnAbhAva, 
nor vipareeta grahaNa nor saMshaya, it is neither abhAva it is jnAna 
virOdhi bhAvarUpa which has the existence in Atma chaitanya and in 
sushupti it will be there with Atman with the vikshepa saMskAra etc. and 
it is sAkshi vedya.   It is this  mUlAvidyA, Sri SSS refuting vehemently. 
If any paNchapAdika vivaraNa scholar has any clarification with regard to 
this, I would be eager to know.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
