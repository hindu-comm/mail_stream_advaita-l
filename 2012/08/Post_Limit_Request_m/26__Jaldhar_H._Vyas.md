Readers please try and remember this.  Not everyone can keep up with high 
volumes of posting.  One solution might be to do as I do and combine 
several replies into one longer posting.

On the other hand this isn't workable.  It would unecessarily hamper 
communication to the point were people would just give up posting 
altogether.  Enthusiasm is good.  I am proud that advaita-l is considered 
one of the premier forums for discussions on dharmic subjects.  We want to 
encourage more people to take part not less.  We just have to try and do 
it in such a way that it does not become overwhelming for others.  I don't 
know what the perfect balance is so I will just urge everyone to be 
considerate.

Now this message I should probably not bother responding to but it annoys 
me.

So this is rich.  You already know what the moderators response is going 
to be yet you bother hundreds of people who can't do anything about it 
with a complaint that other people are wasting list resources!

This thread has spawned over 1mb of mail in 100+ messages from 
approximately 17 people including several who post rarely or not at all. 
I can tell you that the number of hits to the web archives went up atleast 
10%.  Evidently despite your disapproval it is an important topic for 
many people. So if this is "grinding to a halt" I pray that we grind to a 
halt more often.

I'm sorry it doesn't meet your requirements.  Send me your mailing address 
and I will send you a full refund of your purchase price of $0.00 Or 
here's another idea.  Why don't YOU start a non-stupid topic?

There are certain regular posters who to use your delightful expression 
"monopolize" the conversation on the list.  But when they don't post do 
the opressed masses rise up to claim their place?  No there is silence. 
Anyone is welcome to just read what is written silently if that's what 
they want but non-particpants and backseat drivers don't get to complain 
about those who do particpate.
