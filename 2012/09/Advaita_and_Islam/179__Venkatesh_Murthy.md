Namaste

I have questions. In the book the Author is saying some allegation is
there to say Advaita and Islam are similar.

Where is this allegation? Which book? Who is making the allegation?

If it is Sri Vaishnavas it is totally meaningless. In Srirangam and
other places the Muslims raided them.  There is a story about Delhi
Muslim princess playing with Krishna doll. They honour this Muslim
Princess even now. I heard one Sri Vaishnava gentleman saying
Visistadvaita Philosophy and Islam is similar because both describe
God's qualities.
