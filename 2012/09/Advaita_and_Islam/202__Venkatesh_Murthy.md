Namaste

If so why is the author P Sankaranarayanan saying there is a
allegation against Advaita borrowing from Islam? Where is this
allegation? Which book? Who is making allegation?

Other facts. Nizam of Hyd has given costly crown jewels to Sringeri
Matha. When you are going to Sringeri you can see many villages with
Muslims and mosques nearby.
