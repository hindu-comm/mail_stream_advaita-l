Namaste.

The Advaita vedanta is the natural and logical culmination of the Upanishads.The Upanishads
are the crown jewels of the Vedas(shiromani).The Advaita vedanta speaks of the formless,all pervading God,which it calls,Brahman,which means,big(from the "Brh datu).The Islam as I understand also prays to the "formless"Allah,which it calls big.Perhaps,this might have prompted some to form fanciful ideas of borrowing from it.
But,the sant Kabir has composed many songs reflecting the Advaitic ideas.I one of his songs,"din chale bin sahajabinare"sung by the great M.S.Subbulakshmi,there are lines which are:"Balavasta kelugavayi,jab javanitab naritanayi.."which are straight from Adi Shankara's"Bhaja Govindam"which are,'Balastavath kridasaktah,taruastavath tarunisaktah"
Many gifts have also been donated by Tippu sultan to the sringeri mutt,and it is o record from his letters to the then Pontiff of the mutt that he held the Pontiffs ad the mutt in great reverence.
N.Srikanta.
