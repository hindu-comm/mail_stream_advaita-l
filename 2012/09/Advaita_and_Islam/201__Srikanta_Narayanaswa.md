 cannot be a greater joke in saying that Advatins got the idea from 
Islam.It is rather the otherway around when we have evidences that the 
"sufi"system of religion in Islam,and the numerous saints starting from 
Dara shuko and many fakirs,got the idea from Advaita.speaking in a 
lighter vein,many years before,the word "Badari"in "Brahma sutra 
Bhashya"was interpreted as,"padari'meaning father in a church,etc.these 
are all fanciful stories which have no basis.
N.Srikanta.
