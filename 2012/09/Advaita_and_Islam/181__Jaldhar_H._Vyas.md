       In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful.

While I don't think that Sri Sankara would have got his inspiration
from Islam, however it is incorrect to think that Islam does not have
monistic undercurrents. Starting from the Prophet (PBUH) himself,
Naqshaband, Rabia, Mansur, Rumi, Nizamuddin Aulia etc. have been
notable monistic thinkers in Islamic tradition. Generally all of the
sufi masters of previous era as well as today's times expound a
metaphysics that has distinct monistic flavour. All of them trace
their silsilah to Prophet (PBUH)

Jazakallah
