The Quran clearly talks about the two hands of God and talks about the throne of God. Please do not try to advaitise Islam, as it is only a monotheistic religion, in line with christainity. You cannot refer to a sufi to claim that Islam is Advaitic. Sufis are not muslims though some muslims try to say that Sufism is Islamic philosophy. It is however a fact that the Sufis generally aligned themselves with Islam.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Advaita and Islam?

Namaste.

The Advaita vedanta is the natural and logical culmination of the Upanishads.The Upanishads
are the crown jewels of the Vedas(shiromani).The Advaita vedanta speaks of the formless,all pervading God,which it calls,Brahman,which means,big(from the "Brh datu).The Islam as I understand also prays to the "formless"Allah,which it calls big.Perhaps,this might have prompted some to form fanciful ideas of borrowing from it.
But,the sant Kabir has composed many songs reflecting the Advaitic ideas.I one of his songs,"din chale bin sahajabinare"sung by the great M.S.Subbulakshmi,there are lines which are:"Balavasta kelugavayi,jab javanitab naritanayi.."which are straight from Adi Shankara's"Bhaja Govindam"which are,'Balastavath kridasaktah,taruastavath tarunisaktah"
Many gifts have also been donated by Tippu sultan to the sringeri mutt,and it is o record from his letters to the then Pontiff of the mutt that he held the Pontiffs ad the mutt in great reverence.
N.Srikanta.
