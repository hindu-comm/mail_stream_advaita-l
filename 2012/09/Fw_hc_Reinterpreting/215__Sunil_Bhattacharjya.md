Do you condone Mani-Manjari's casting aspersions on the character of Adi Sankaracharya's mother? What proof did they have? Everything should be looked at holistically.

No. For the simple reason that such things never really happened or
were implemented, unlike the real jihad. It is just an exageration for
effect in poetry - something "modern" minds don't seem to understand.
Sankara and Ramanuja quote a verse which says molten lead has to be
poured into the ears of a shudra who has heard the vedas being
recited. Do you think anyone really implemented that? If the previous
one were jihad, what would you call this?
