Namaskar,

Majority of the Sankara-maths subscribe to the view that Adi Sankaracharya passed away in in the early 5th century BCE and they produce the unbroken guru-parampara to prove that. Adi Sankaracharya was not the first person to talk about Advaita. Patanjali in his Patanjali-Pancasiti,which has been referred to by Abhinavagupta as Ananta-karika, talks of Advaita. Then came Gaudapada, the param-guru of Adi Sankaracharya, who was also an advaitin. They all trace the concept of Advaita to Shruti. The Advaita is not for everybody. It is only for a person, who has seen the temporal world and has developed the mental make-up to make that person yearn for the ultimate truth. The truth is that the Lord has not created the world out of anything external to Him. Everything is Him and nothing but Him. Advaitin thrives for that unity and wants to get out of the notion of any separateness (ie. any individual existence).

It is not that Madhvacharya did not understand the Advaita. In some of his works he did write a line or two on Advaita. Madhvacharya, however despised Adi Sankaracharya and thought that Adi Sankaracharya was out to destroy the world. Madhvacharya did realise that the individual identities or egos make the world, where one sees the others as separate beings. He interpreted the losing of the ego or the individual identity as the destruction of the world. As he loved his own individual identiy (particularly as the son of Vayu) he was afraid that he would lose his dear individual identity if takes the path of Advaitic thinking. 

Regards,
Sunil KB

Namaskar,

Reinterpreting Dwaita versus Adwaita by sanjay rao. 

I have always felt the Dwaita (Duality between god and man , as separate entities apart from other dualities), and Adwaita (Unity of the divine and the gross) debate dogging South Indian Brahmins for the last 700 years, was an utter waste of time for those interested in personal spiritual evolution. I believe although Madhwacharya and Adi Shankaracharya were extremely god realized people and had seemingly contradictory views on the surface, perhaps they were talking about different facets of reality. I felt intuitively uneasy following this line of dogged debate being undertaken by contemporary pundits, as I felt it had zero productivity when it comes to my own spiritual growth. Although I must admit that it is an interesting topic of debate for completely academic purposes.. .

Just out of curiosity I gave it a shot. Both the masters are great geniuses giving different points of view, I felt rather than take a confrontational approach as most Indians tend to prefer, and have taken for the past 700 years, I felt it helps if you actually merge the two views thus, helping us get a better three dimensional stereoscopic vision to the issue of Duality/Non duality, between god and man.
