PraNAms 
I must say that the discussions shifted from the advaita - vishishTaadviata philosophical systems to more caste - practices. Shree Anandji has discussed the Advaita siddhi - the refutes the nyaayamRitam of Dviatins - but I do not think he completed the discussions - while Shreeman S.M.S. Chari maama (he is no more) told me once that no one has clearly responded to Shatadhuushanii of Shree Vedanta Deshika-ShreemanCharihas written a book with the title- advaita-vishishtaadvaitapresenting the argumentsof shatadhuushanii.Shree Ananata Shastrihas written - shatabhuushanii -apparently counter the arguments presented in Shataduushanii - but as perShreeman Chari maama- he did not addresspoint by point otherthanreinterating the advaita position.
Discussion more on the issues than on the personalitiesand accusations at an individual will be more fulfilling.
Hari Om!
