Om
Any science is objective cognisable
With the senses.
Vedas are the pramAnA and the source of knowledge addressing human problems and solutions.it is apourusheyA and pramAnA.
To understand the SELF one should have a GURU who is a shAstravith and sampradAya vith.
ShraddA in GURU and shAstra is a must in pursuit of BRAHMAjnAnAm.
