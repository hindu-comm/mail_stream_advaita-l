The creation itself is a matter of curiosity.The beings that we see on earth differ from each other,and yet have different functions.An elephant which is huge in form and the ant which is a miniature creature have their functio in nature.A spider web a honey comb,a horners nest are all engineering marvels,which humans cannot repeat.This itself shows that everything has its place in nature.
N.Srikanta.
