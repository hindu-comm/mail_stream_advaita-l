 "Quoted below is an excerpt from Swami Maheshananda Giri's introduction to
the Chandogya Upanishad Bhashya, edited and published by Mahesh Research
Institute, Varanasi, 1982:

// We have been studying the different commentators, such as Srikantha,
Ramanuja, Vallabha, Nimbarka, Baladeva, Srikara, Madhva and the moderners,
for over fifty years now. We have seen that apart from the criticism of the
Advaita-view, there is little more in the content of their traditional view
that is not found in Shankara, or is not just a logical corollary of what
he has said. It is our challenge that apart from logic-chipping, not a
single spiritual fibre, which has not been either supported or contradicted
by Shankara, can be shown in the works of these commentators."
_________________________________________________________________________________
I the above list of commentators after Shankara we have to include Bhaskara who preded Ramanuja.It is said that Ramanuja followed,Bhaskara in interpreting Brahma sutras,and was a Bheda-abheda vadin.
N.Srikanta.
