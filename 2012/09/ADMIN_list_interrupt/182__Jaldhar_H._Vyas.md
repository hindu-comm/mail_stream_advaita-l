Sorry but the server that hosts advaita-vedanta.org had a sligh problem 
and was down since sunday.  Everything should be back to normal now.  If 
you posted during that time and do not see your message on the list wait 
for a day or so for the backlog to be processed.  If you still don't see 
it then resend.
