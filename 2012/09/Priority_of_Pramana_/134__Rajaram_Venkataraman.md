I can only hope that Svaha finds Agni cool :)

Our tradition believes that Vedas were revealed to Brahman and passed down
through ages. But based on an analysis of genetic, archaelogical and fossil
records scientists have established that humans evolved only 200000 years
ago. They have also shown that evolution is a fact in laboratories. Now,
what are the rules to decide whether we should accept sabda pramana or
scientific analysis in this case? I understand that science may not be what
tradition calls anumana but more like sambhavana.
