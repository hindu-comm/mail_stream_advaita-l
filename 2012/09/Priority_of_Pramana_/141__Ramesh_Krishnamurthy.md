The rule simply is that the veda is a pramANa only on matters that are
outside the domain of laukika pramANa-s. The development of
pramANa-shAstra is part of the mImAMsA systems. The advaitin-s largely
follow the bhATTa mimAMsaka-s in this matter, as per the maxim
"vyavahAre bhATTa nayaH". sureshvarAchArya in his naiShkarmyasiddhi
describes the criteria for accepting something as a pramANa. I had
described these criteria in detail in an earlier post on this forum
not too long ago.

By the way, your stand that the veda teaches "creation" is something
that would be rejected by the very school that made it its business to
understand the veda - the pUrvamImAMsaka-s.
