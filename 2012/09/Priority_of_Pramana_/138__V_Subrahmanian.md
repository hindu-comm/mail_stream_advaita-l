I would like to add this:

The intention of the purANa, which is part of the scripture, for Shankara
too relies on its statements even in the Brahmasutra bhashya for certain
things, is to enable the jiva-aspirant to go its way (the purANa's way) and
earn puNyam.  This puNyam will help him in getting into true brahmajijnAsA
in the future.  Things like panchAnga shravaNam are aimed at this in the
long run.  So even if one does not believe the stories as facts yet they
have a punya-generating value.  In any case in the final picture all these
things said in the puranas are going to be given up lock stock and barrel.
Positing Brahman as jagatkAraNam, even in the Brahmsutra 'janmAdyasya
yataH', and later negating its kAraNatva is a prakriyA well known as
adhyAropa - apavAda.  So what is posited as adhyAropa need not be, cannot
be, facts, by the very name it gets.  In the eyes of Vedanta as presented
by Shankara and Gaudapada it is impossible to ascertain how the world came
into being.  The accepting of a certain scheme to cater to the needs of
setting the jijnAsA process in motion is all that is done.  Within that
scheme a certain extent of logicality is sought to be established.

subbu
