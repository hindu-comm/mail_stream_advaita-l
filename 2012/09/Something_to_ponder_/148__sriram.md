Dear Sri Sarma
What you have conveyed is in agreement with my thinking also-especially how 
the lesser species cognise the world outside with their sense organs and how 
their tiny to colassal brains -ant -to elephant-interpret the inputs of 
their sense organs and lead their lives till they also pass out.It is a 
mystery and in my opinion it is beyond science`s grasp.Consciousness is gift 
to humanspecies as lesser species donot seem to be conscious of their 
existence except that they defend themselves and attack when posed with real 
or imaginary threats.Here again we only think that they attack us even when 
we are friendly!
Even a thousand rebirths as human beings will not be enough to unravel these 
mysteries.R.Krishnamoorthy.
