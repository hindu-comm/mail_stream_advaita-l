PraNAms

Most of the life forms are conscious of their environment or at least programed to do so for survival.

Yes existence of any inertis established by the knowledge its existence while existence of consciousness is self-proven in all life forms since they need to be conscious of their environment for their survival. Being conscious of xis different from being self-conscious or conscious of oneself. In vishishtadvaita they differentiate these two as one is dharma bhuuta jnaanam and the other as dharmi jnaanam. 

Hari Om!
