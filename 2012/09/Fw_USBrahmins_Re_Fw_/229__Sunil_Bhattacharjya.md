Dear friends,

In order to create a great image for himself Madhvacharya called Adi Sankaracharya a demon, without any basis. One who has read the chapter 22 of Madhvacharya's Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya, knows about it and the hostility of Madhvacharya against the great Adi Sankaracharya. Madhvacharya's disciple Narayana Panditacharya wrote baseless things about Adi Sankaracharya and his mother, in the sixth chapter of the Mani-Manjari. He wrote the Mani-Manjari to predispose the people against Adi Sankaracharya. The Narayana went on to write the biography of Madhvacharya. No civilized person can write the extermely dirty language used by Narayana Panditacharya for character assassination of Adi Sankaracharya and his family. If the Moderatorji permits I can reproduce some portions of the Mani-Manjari so that the esteemed members can see for themselves what type of man Narayana Panditacharya was. He at first pointed out about the disagreements of the Sankara
 Vijayas and then went on to write his imaginary things about Adi Sankaracharya. Of course one can admire the extremely shrewd tactics of Narayana Panditacharya.

I am proud to say that inspite of such grave provocations, the Advaitins did not loose their cool and they behaved majestically all these centuries.

Regards,
Sunil KB
