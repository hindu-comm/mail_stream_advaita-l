Namaste,
// A dvaitin can never see the common factor ATMA in every one! //
One should not generalize the term *dvaitin*. Even advaitins are no less whenit comes to the scathing remarks !
Mahamahopadhyaya Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavih wrote a book called *tucchO rAmAnujaH* !!
The puNDits who suffer from shAstra vAsana, rAga / dvESa write like these.
Nevertheless, we as sAdhakAs should accept only those that are useful for our spiritual upliftment and reject those that are detrimental to our sAdhana.
