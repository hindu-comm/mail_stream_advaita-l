Namaste

I have 2 points. Is Citta Shuddhi necessary for Citta Vrutti Nirodha?
What is Yoga philosophy saying? Because the Yoga philosophy is aiming
for Citta Vrutti Nirodha. If Citta Shuddhi not necessary there cannot
be Advaita Jnana in Samadhi also. Advaita is saying Jnana comes from
Vedanta Vakyas only. It cannot be in some meditation experience. If
the Advaiti has Vedanta Vakya Jnana he can practice so many things
including Yoga. He can experience same Jnana in wallking, jogging and
others. Why he must go into Samadhi only?

Yoga is very good for health. I agree very much with this. But there
are many very good things for health like eating clean vegetarian
food, taking regular meals, walking and other things. These things are
helping us to become physically and mentally healthy. They are
indirectly helping in Sadhana. But we cannot say Jnana comes because
of them.
