==================================

Namaste,

The aparoksha jnAna is possible for those who have properly followed the
scheme of shravaNa, manana and nidhidhyAsana which is clear from the
brihadAraNyaka upanishad bhAshya. Swami Vidyaranya too in the jivanmukti
vivEka itself says that this scheme is mandatory. He says aparoksha jnAna
is gained by those who properly follow this scheme (samyag anuSTitaiH).

Here is a highly pertinent excerpt by Swami SS from his introduction to
munDaka upaniSat:

Some people may get doubt about the need for the sAdhanAs in the prakriyA
of the bhAshyakAra since knowledge is gained from the vAkyArthajnAna alone.
But then, the brahmavidyA is not like any other worldly knowledge. For
Atmadarshana the sAdhanas are - shAstrOpadEsha, AchAryOpadEsha, shama,
dama, dhyAna, sarvatyAga & vairAgya. Through these sAdhanAs one
attains a *special
kind of knowledge (vishEsharUpa/sAkshAdanubharUpa jnAna). This is called
vijnAna in the vEdAnta*.

vairAgya, vEdAdhyayana, granthadhAraNa, arthavichAra also required.

One should follow strictly - satyavachana & brahmacharya. The Atmachintana
should be continuous. Since the Atman is the sAkshi for the vrittis of the
antaHkaraNa one should turn one's extrovert mind inward & direct it towards
the  Atmapratyaya and follow it. *This is most important according to
AchArya he says*.

(Swami SS cites various bhAshya passages in support of this. The
aforementioned passage is translated from a kannada book)

I think none of the traditional AchAryas say that AtmAkAra/akhaNDAkAra
vritti is not required. In fact it is this vritti which destroys avidyA.
Whether  during this vritti triputi is transcended, as it were or not,
seems to be the subject of debate?

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
