Dear Bhaskar, 

Precisely therein lies the problem for most of us - not giving much consideration
to our state of mind!

SravaNa makes one a Srotriya. What is the route for a Srotriya to become a
brahmanishTha?

Again, we come to the crux of the issue. What is this anubhava that is brahma jnAna?
In what avasthA does the anubhava take place? And why does bhagavatpAda call such
anubhava the avasAna of jnAna? Clearly, it is not just the experience of jAgrat, svapna
and sushupti (or rather, the memory of sushupti) nor merely an aggregate of anubhava-s
in these states. Surely, given that there is a prior state of ajnAna for one who finds it
necessary to embark upon a quest for jnAna, the anubhava has to have happened at 
some point of time in his or her life, right? What state would one call that? Why not
make use of the ready made word attested in the brahmasUtra, namely samAdhi?
You can drop the adjective nirvikalpa, if that makes you too uncomfortable!

I am not talking of physical death of a person acclaimed as a jnAnI. I am not talking
of an ajnAnI's need for upadeSa from a guru who is a jnAnI. Rather, I am talking of
the same person who used to be an ajnAnI in the past and is now a jnAnI. What 
happens to/in the antaHkaraNa of that person at the moment jnAna arises and/or
during the rest of the natural life for that person who is a brahmanishTha?

As for your question about whether jnAnAnubhava can happen only in samAdhi or
not, I have two answers. One, it is not for an ajnAnI to speculate about when and
how jnAnAnubhava happens, so I can only cite the testimony of SAstra and upadeSa.
Two, where the jnAnI stands in the realization neha nAnAsti kiMcana, not merely as
a paroksha piece of knowledge but as one's own realization, such jnAnAnubhava IS
itself samAdhi. That it cannot be otherwise is a foregone conclusion. 

What is meant by bAdhita jnAna of tAdAtmya buddhi? I know very well that the sun
does not "rise in the east" but I still can go about my life habitually using that phrase.
This "rising-in-the-east"-ness of the sun is bAdhita jnAna too. Is brahmajnAna also
only like that? Is that what is intended by the word anubhava for a jnAnI?

I wonder who are those people who say that this is mandatory. If you can cite some
source, that would greatly help. I rather think you are mistakenly assigning a demand
value and taking as mandatory what is only a descriptive narrative of a 2-3 hour (or
weeks on end) experience of nirvikalpa samAdhi that happened to one or the other
guru hailed as a jnAnI.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
