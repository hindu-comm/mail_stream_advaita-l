Here's a question to ponder. Is it or is it not possible for jnAna to rise during
the lifetime of a yogAbhyAsI on the path of such kramamukti? Is there any
necessary obstacle to jnAna in the case of such a person, which will require
janmAntara for jnAna to rise? When one repeatedly points out other passages
from the same granthakAra-s and other teachers that show how dhyAnAdi
sAdhana-s are sahakArI kAraNa-s for the rise of jnAna, I fail to see why they
should be misrepresented as if they are compromising the sampradAya. Is
such a criticism a deliberate distortion or based only on a misunderstanding?

This is an artificial and self-imposed limitation. I have pointed out numerous
places in the bhAshya-s where dhyAna is called antaranga of jnAnanishThA.
I don't know from where you get this prescription of "till pratyAhAra". Earlier,
I thought you had said vedAntins could take yogAbhyAsa up to dhAraNA?

ananya sAdhanatvAc ca nirodhasya. na hy Atma vijnAna tat smRti saMtAna
vyatirekeNa citta vRtti nirodhasya sAdhanam asti - so says the very same
bRhadAraNyaka bhAshya in the very same passage. Why pick and choose
what one likes from the bhAshya-s and pretend as if the passages that one
doesn't like (or perhaps really understand) do not exist?
