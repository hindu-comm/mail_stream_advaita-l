Samadhi is also experience of some person in Jagrat. Some people joke
to say Samadhi is Sushupti. But in both cases it will also have Ajnana
in it because all three Jagrat, Svapna and Sushupti are in Ajnana
only. How can Jnana come in Samadhi? Some people can take drugs and
have wonderful hallucinations. But it is also Ajnana only.
