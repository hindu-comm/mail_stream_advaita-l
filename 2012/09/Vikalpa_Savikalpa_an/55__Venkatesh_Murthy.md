Why there is the necessity for Samadhi experience? Janaka was a Jnani
and King. He did not have time to do meditation and go into Samadhi.
But he got Jnana doing his daily activities only. It is not correct
saying Jnana will come only in Samadhi. When he is continuously
thinking of Upanishad Statements he will get Jnana. Jnana may come
very quickly in some seconds for some, in minutes for some, hours for
some days for some, months for some and many years for some and for
some it may not come in this life.

For some it may come in meditation like Samadhi also. But Samadhi and
Yoga is not the only way.
