Atyantika doesn't mean automatic.
Atyantika-nirodha means ultimate cessation of mind which is caused by
GYAna. And as GYAna doesn't destroy mind of a GYAnI, so this cessation has
to be of nature of mithyAtva-nishchaya.
If however, it literally means ultimate cessation of mind, then we have to
accept that he is talking of a GYAnI whose both bodies are destroyed due to
end of prArabdha, i.e. videha-mukta.
So, in either case he is not saying that GYAna is sAdhana of nirodha which
is practiced according to scriptures.

Quite good.
I see it like this :

mahAvAkya with shrvaNa, etc. is sAdhana of GYAna and it results in lack of
future bodies, i.e called videha-mukti(remember such is possible while having
body and it is immediate to GYAna) by vidyAraNya. Here vAsanAxaya and
manonAsha are needed but only to the extent which enables one to do shravaNa,
etc. It doesn't expect ripen state of manonAsha and vAsanA-xaya.
While anyone who practices mano-nAsha and vAsanA-xaya till they ripe, will get
shAnti, etc.(which is called jIvanmukti by vidyAraNya).
Here videha-mukti occurs just after GYAna without any other practice while
jIvan-mukti needs extra practice of mano-nAsha and vAsanA-xaya.

Now, if someone says that GYAnI needs samAdhi for jIvan-mukti, I will never
oppose. I once hinted this in my previous post, I think. So, GYAna is
enough to generate videha-mukti in this light. I was talking of this moxa.
According to the previous definition, jIvanmukti is not direct result of
a-GYAna-nAsha and hence is not same as kaivalya-mukti supported by bhAShya,
etc.

In sha~Nkara's view, if one does mahAvAkya-artha-vichAra, then he gets
GYAna and that destroys a-GYAna. This lack of a-GYAna and karma-s(other
than prArabdha) is termed as jIvanmukti. And his state after death, which
is marked by end of  prArabdha-karma, avidyA-lesha and both bodies is
termed as videha-mukti(same as kaivalya). Here jIvanmukti occurs with GYAna
and videha-mukti is after death. No practices needed for any of them.

This is the difference of definitions.
