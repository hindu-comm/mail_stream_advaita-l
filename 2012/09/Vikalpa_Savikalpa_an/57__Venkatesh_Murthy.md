Namaste

Fine. Leave Janaka. What about Vamadeva? He got Jnana when he was in
the mother's womb itself. How can he practice Ashtanga Yoga including
Samadhi in the womb? This is showing Yoga practice is not necessary.
It may be good to practice but it is not the only way to get Jnana.

In Gita Krishna is talking Sankhya and Yoga. In Sankhya approach we
require analytical skills. If sharp analytical skill is there the
person will not need anything more than that for Jnana. Yoga is a
different approach. Both will be proper approach for Jnana. But we
can't say only Yoga approach is correct.
