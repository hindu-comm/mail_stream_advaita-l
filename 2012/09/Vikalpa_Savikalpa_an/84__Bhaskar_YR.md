brahma jnAna doesn't come out of the blue in a jiffy !

sampradAya AchAryAs say that he might have done intense 
sAdhana in his previous birth and hence he got the sAdhana phala
in the womb itself ! A born jivanmukta.

Yes, brahma jnAna is  the result of intense mumukshatva, vairAgya, 
shravaNAdi sAkshAt sAdhana.  Since vAmadeva has done these sAdhana-s in 
his pUrva janma (ofcourse he cannot do any sAdhana in his present janma in 
mother's womb :-)), the sAdhana phala yielded in 'mAtru garbha' itself. 
So, in short knowledge can originate in this janma itself, if not (if 
there is any obstacles) it might be realized in the next janma without any 
 noticable sAdhana in that janma.  shuka maharshi another name comes to my 
mind.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
