Namaste,

Is personal experience a pramANa in the adhyAtma vidyA? Here is what
Shankara says in the regard:

"So far as the deliberation on Brahman is concerned, the direct texts,
indicatory marks, etc. are not the sole means of the valid knowledge of
Brahman, as they are when religious duties are deliberated on. But in the
former case, the vedic texts, personal experience, etc. are the valid means
as far as possible;* *for the knowledge of Brahman culminates in
experience, and it relates to an existing entity."

(Brahmasutra bhashya 1.1.2)

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
