================================

Namaste,

According to laghu yOga vAsishTa janaka got enlightenment through the
samAdhi abhyAsa. You can see the details of his sAdhana in the following

It should be noted that Sri Vidyaranya, a sampradAya AchArya has profusely
quoted this text in his work 'jIvanmukti vivEka'. I could trace this
portion with the help of his citation.

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
