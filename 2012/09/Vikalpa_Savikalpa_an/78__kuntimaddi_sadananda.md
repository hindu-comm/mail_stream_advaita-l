Subbuji
– PraNAms

In
Slokas 57 and 58 of Ch. I of Panchadasi – Shree Vidyaranya talks about adaptation
of yogic method of nidhidhyasana and then refers to Ch6 of Gita sloka – yathaa deepo
nivaatashthaH – saying that this is what Krishna taught to Arjuna – yogic method
of nidhidhyasana differs from Vedantic method as exemplified in the sloka -brahmaarpaNam
.. brahma karma samadhinaa –where nidhidhyaasana involves, while transacting in the
world, recognizing kartaa-karma-kriya-kaaraka-phala – all are Brahman. Implication
is the adaptation of the yogic method of nidhidhyaasanam is different from that
of Vedantic method – granted that the end result is to remove the pratibhandas
due to inadequate chitta suddhi so that jnaanam gained by shravana and manana
becomes internalized. 
I was discussing these slokas only last week.
Hari
Om!
