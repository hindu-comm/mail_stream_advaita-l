I am having very little access to internet, being away from home.  I
wish to point out that the gita shloka talking about 'yoga bhrashTa'
is concerning the legitimate jnAnasAdhana that has the nididhyasana
ingredient involving dhyana.  This has been clarified by Sri SSS also
by establishing that the AdhyAtma Yoga of Vedanta has dhyAna and
samAdhi culminating in aparoksha jnana resulting in moksha.
Accordingly, the dyana of the 6th chapter of the Gita is not an
alternative to any other method but the only sadhana of Vedanta.  The
other references are fthe Kathopanishad 'yacched vAngmanasI
praajnaH....' etc.
