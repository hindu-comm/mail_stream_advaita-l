By the force of same logic can we say that shruti/AchAryOpadEsha, manana
and nidhidhyAsana is not necessary?

As I have said earlier, I do agree that sAdhana (practice) is required for 
the brahma jnAna, there is no second opinion on that.  But what is that 
sAdhana that shankara recommends?? whether he says ashtAnga yOga & 
resultant samAdhi anubhava is jnAna sAdhana??  Shankara, I think 
invariably prescribes veda mArga not ashtAnga yOga mArga ( though it has 
its own efficacy for the yOgAbhyAsi-s ).  Suggestions like tadviddhi 
praNipAtena, tadvijnAnArthaM sa gurumevAbhigacchet samitpANiH shrotreeyaM, 
brahma nishTaM, yenAksharaM purushaM veda satyaM prOvAcha tAM tattvatO 
brahma vidyAM, shAstrAchAryOpadesha shamadamAdi saMskrutaM manaH etc. lead 
us to veda mArga only i.e. sahakAri sAdhana-s like karmAnushtAna, upAsana, 
dhyAna and direct sAdhana-s like shravaNa, manana & nidhidhyAsana.  I 
think no where shankara categorically recommends ashtAnga yOga mArga for 
the Atma jnAna sAdhana.  OTOH, he says yOga shAstra is dvaita shAstra and 
it would not teach Atmaikatva vijnAna.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
