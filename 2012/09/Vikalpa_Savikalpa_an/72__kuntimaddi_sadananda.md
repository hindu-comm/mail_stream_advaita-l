PraNAms to all.
As I
understand, it is true that samaadhi or even nidhidhyaasana are not pramaanas. Samadhi is meant for abiding in the knowledge
that has already been gained via Vedanta shravana and mananam. As per yoga philosophy, in spite of
nirvikalpaka Samadhi, they subscribe to dvaita philosophy only and not advaita.
The adaptation of yoga techiniques by advaita is meant more for nidhidhyaasana
after gaining Jnaanam, but due to insufficient chitta suddhi remained as pratibandhaka
jnaaam. Vidyaranya says in Panchadasi that one can make it as aparoksha Jnaanam
or apratibandhaka Jnaanam by practicing savikalpa and then nirvikalpaka Samadhi. 
Hari Om!
