Forwarded here is an announcement of a fine work in Sanskrit verse that at

announcement was made in the Advaitin forum.

Namaste

Many thanks for sharing this simple yet profound work. It provides a base
for
contemplation. Vedanta sAdhana, adhikArI, viShaya, phalam, sambandha, the
sequence etc. contained in the verses are truly appreciable. It is indeed an
invaluable gift to the seeking humanity.

Regards
subbu
