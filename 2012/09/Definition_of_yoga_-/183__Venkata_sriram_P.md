Namaste,

Yet another thought provoking definition of *yOga* by srI sadAsivabrahmEndra saraswati

His Holinesssays in manISa panchakaM bhASya called *tAtparya deepika* as:

// yOgO jIva-brahmaikya jnAnaM tadvAn yOgi tathA cha smaryatE //

// vrittihInaM manaH krutvA kSEtrajnaM paramAtmani ; EkIkrutya vimuchyEta
yOgO(a)yaM mukhya unchyatE //

Here, in this context, yoga is jiva-brahma-aikya only and the one who has this knowledge is also called yogi. 

This is the bhASya to 4th sloka of manISa panchakaM

regs,
sriram
