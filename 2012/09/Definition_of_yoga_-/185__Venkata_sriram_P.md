Namaste,

Yes. The work is available in print in English. 

Sanskrit Academy ofOsmania University, Hyderabadhas published it and there 
are good number of copies available. The contact details are available in their
website.

However, Dr.K.Aravida Rao, IPS (Retd.), former Director General of Police of Andhra Pradesh, is also one of the active members of this academy and he has got some 
personal copies for circulation. 

If you can contact me offline, i would give you Dr. Rao's contact number & email Id for personal contact.

regs,
sriram
