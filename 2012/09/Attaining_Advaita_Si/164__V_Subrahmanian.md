To my knowledge Shankara does not talk of attaining VaikunTha in the
prasthAna traya bhashya.  In case there is a mention of such attainment in
any of the prakaraNa works or stotra works like the VishNu pAdAdi keshAnta
stotram it could be a reference to saguna brahma loka.  In fact in the
Shankara vijayam it is said that Shankara helped his mother AryAmbA attain
ViShNu loka.

As we have seen already in another thread that the four kinds of mukti like
sArUpya are not considered as the real mukti of the Upanishads according to
Advaitic tradition.
