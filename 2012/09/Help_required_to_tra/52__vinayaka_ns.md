Namaste.

I am looking for a mantra/s (9th?) of the nrusimha pUrva tApini upanishad
which contains a rare and comprehensive definition of mAyA. This mantra has
been quoted by Sri vidyAraNya in his panchadashi. I would be grateful if
someone gives the original text with or without translation.

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
