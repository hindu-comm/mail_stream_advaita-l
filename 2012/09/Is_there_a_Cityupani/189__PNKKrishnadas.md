As requested, here is the reference in the Taittiriya Upanisad,
II.iii.1 (Translation and Commentary by Swami Gambhirananda):


"....the Vedic text, "Where all the Vedas get united is the Self in
the mind" (Cityupanisad, XI. 1, Tai. A. III. ii, 1) which declares the
identity of the Rg-mantras etc., with the eternal Self, can be
reconciled only if the mantras are eternal."


Thank you.

Krishnadas

Subject: [Advaita-l] Is there a Cityupanisad?

Namaste Krishnadas Ji,

If you can type the excerpts from the commentary, it would be of
immense help.

I can see only 2 options here:

1) The word *city* might be a true translation of the word *pura* in
sanskrit. So, it could
 have beenTripura Upanishad.

or

2) It could have been a sandhi of *iti+upaniSad* which is read as
*ityupanishad*. 
 The word *C* could be either a typo or parenthesis (left bracket)

This is my understanding as i havn't gone through the book.

regs,
sriram
