Subject: [Advaita-l] Is there a Cityupanisad?

Namaste,

In reading Swami Gambhirananda's commentary and translation of the
Taittiriya Upanisad, (in Eight Upanisads, Calcutta: Advaita Ashrama,
6th impression, 1986, Volume 1), at sloka II.iii.1 on page 315, the
Swami makes a single reference to "Cityupanisad".

I have been unable to find any reference at all to this upanisad
elsewhere, including using any variations to the word "citta" in this
context. 

Are the learned members of this List able to shed some light on this
Upanisad please?


Krishnadas
