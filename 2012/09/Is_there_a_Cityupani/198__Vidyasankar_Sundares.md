At one point of time, before every computer had good abilities to render
Devanagari fonts nicely, almost everybody on the list was following the
ITRANS scheme or something similar. Even today, not everybody has
access to computers that render Indic fonts well. For the purposes of
quick email communications, a simple transliteration scheme such as
the one used on the following link should be enough, so long as readers
keep the overall scheme in mind.

> This whole name-guessing game would end if the name was presented in either
> devanAgarI or any transliteration scheme.
> For me the best possible name is :
> chityupaniShad
> In some transliteration schemes people write cha as ca and chha as cha.
> Now the meaning part :
> chiti means chaitanyam, consciousness.
> The word chit and chiti both mean the same thing.
> 
> But, again this is a guess.
> So, please present sanskrit names in some fixed scheme.
