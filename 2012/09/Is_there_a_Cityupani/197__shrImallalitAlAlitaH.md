This whole name-guessing game would end if the name was presented in either
devanAgarI or any transliteration scheme.
For me the best possible name is :
chityupaniShad
In some transliteration schemes people write cha as ca and chha as cha.
Now the meaning part :
chiti means chaitanyam, consciousness.
The word chit and chiti both mean the same thing.

But, again this is a guess.
So, please present sanskrit names in some fixed scheme.
