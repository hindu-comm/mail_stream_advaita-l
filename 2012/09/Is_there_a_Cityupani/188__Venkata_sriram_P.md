Namaste Krishnadas Ji,

If you can type the excerpts from the commentary, it would be of immense help.

I can see only 2 options here:

1) The word *city* might be a true translation of the word *pura* in sanskrit. So, it could
 have beenTripura Upanishad.

or

2) It could have been a sandhi of *iti+upaniSad* which is read as *ityupanishad*. 
 The word *C* could be either a typo or parenthesis (left bracket)

This is my understanding as i havn't gone through the book.

regs,
sriram
