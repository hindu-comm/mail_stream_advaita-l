Dear Sri Venkata sriram
Your guess 2] should be the correct one.Because city is an English word and 
upanishad is a sanskrit word.I feel that it is all due to a printer`s 
devil.R.Krishnam,oorthy.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Is there a Cityupanisad?


Namaste Krishnadas Ji,

If you can type the excerpts from the commentary, it would be of immense 
help.

I can see only 2 options here:

1) The word *city* might be a true translation of the word *pura* in 
sanskrit. So, it could
have been Tripura Upanishad.

or

2) It could have been a sandhi of *iti+upaniSad* which is read as 
*ityupanishad*.
The word *C* could be either a typo or parenthesis (left bracket)

This is my understanding as i havn't gone through the book.

regs,
sriram
