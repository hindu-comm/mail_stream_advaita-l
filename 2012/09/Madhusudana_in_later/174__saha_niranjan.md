Probably BhR has not been quoted by Dhanapati but he has criticised MS on several counts in the Gita, which I'll devote a section to.

I would like to know how central is Madhusudana in Advaita tradition? I'd
like to know references to him by acharyas after him. I know Dhanapati Suri
disagrees with him in a few counts. I'd like to specifically know if
BhaktiRasayana has been quoted. I know that the previous Sringeri Acharyal
quotes Madhusudana's three stages of devotion.
