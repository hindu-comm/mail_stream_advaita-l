I'd like to see  details of criticisms by Dhanpati. I don't think he differs on key points including the nature of Lord's form or bhakti. He differs on details of karma khanda, which is fine. 

It would be interesting to see what  scholars say Madhusudana's influence on generations of advaitins who came after him.

Probably BhR has not been quoted by Dhanapati but he has criticised MS on several counts in the Gita, which I'll devote a section to.

I would like to know how central is Madhusudana in Advaita tradition? I'd
like to know references to him by acharyas after him. I know Dhanapati Suri
disagrees with him in a few counts. I'd like to specifically know if
BhaktiRasayana has been quoted. I know that the previous Sringeri Acharyal
quotes Madhusudana's three stages of devotion.
