Same objection may come here also. The Purohita is giving instructions
but his voice is coming from electronic medium. It is not coming to us
directly without any in between medium. Is it correct to take
instructions like this? If correct we can also play Pooja Mantras and
do Pooja according to them and it will be correct.

But what Sri Subbu prabhuji saying is purOhita is not required if the 
kartru himself knows the maNtra-s & procedure of the karma-s.  But I doubt 
this stand as I have seen in Mattur, even ghanapAti katru-s for 
shubhAshubha karma-s at their house asking their kula purOhita or AchArya 
to come and do it.  And they do saMkalpa also like that only.  I think 
shOdasha saMskAra & related karma-s should be done through one's own kula 
purOhita though he himself knows it very well.  I vaguely remember that 
somewhere in Apasthamba gruhya sUtra there is a mention about importance 
and role of AchArya in these karma-s.  But nothing coming to my mind right 
now.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
