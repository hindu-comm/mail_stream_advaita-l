Namaste

To what extent your saying below AchArya Mukhena Karishye is supported
in Gruhya Sutras? It may be true for Non Dvijas only because they
cannot say Mantras.

I know one daughter of a Sanskrit scholar made a big issue of this in
her marriage. She was saying because Purohita said all Mantras she was
married to him.
Elders in her family somehow made her to go with bridegroom.
