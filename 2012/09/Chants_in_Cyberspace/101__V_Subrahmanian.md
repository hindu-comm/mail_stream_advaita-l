Some years back I participated in an upAkarma ritual in Br.Sri Ganesha
GhanapAThigaL's house. He is well known to the Kanchi and Sringeri Acharyas
personally.   He had finished his early morning paurohityam for two or
three batches of upAkarma in other localities.  Some two or three of us
joined him at his house where he conducted a fine, leisurely upaakarma with
homam for himself and the rest of us.

I do not know about any gruhya sutra prohibition for such conduct.
