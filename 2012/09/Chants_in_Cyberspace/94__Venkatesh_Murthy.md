Namaste Sri Subrahmanian

Sometime back there was some person saying if we play Mantras from
cassettes and CD and do Pooja and other activities it is not correct.

Some person said they did some experiments on Mantras from CD and
priests saying without mikes. The effect of electronic Mantras is not
same. There may be no benefits.

Same objection may come here also. The Purohita is giving instructions
but his voice is coming from electronic medium. It is not coming to us
directly without any in between medium. Is it correct to take
instructions like this? If correct we can also play Pooja Mantras and
do Pooja according to them and it will be correct.
