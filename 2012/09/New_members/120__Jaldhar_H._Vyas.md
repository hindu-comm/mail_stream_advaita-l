Zen monk related to the Advaita Vedanta through Wayne Liquorman, Adyashanti 
and Ramesh Balsekar teachings.


Seshadry
--------

I am a devout Hindu with great reverence to Sri Aadi Sankaracharya Swamy
vaaru. I have a deep desire to understand the Advaita philosophy and explore
the possibilities of its application in real life. I pray for the Krupa
Ktaksham of Sadguru in my quest. With regards.
