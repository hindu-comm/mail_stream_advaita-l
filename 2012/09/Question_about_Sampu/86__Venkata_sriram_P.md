Namaste,

///

In continuation with Rudra Trisathi,each Rudara Trisathi is recited followed
with Lalitha tirsathi for archana To Lord Shiva and Sri Lalitha.together If I am right this is called as "Samputika".

//

There are several permutations & combinations involved with set of mantras and
depending upon the combinations, it is called samputikarana, samyojana, pallava etc.

For instance:

Om + hreem = yojana
hreem + Om = pallava
Om + hreem + Om = samputikarana

So, you can observe that when the same mantra is prefixed and suffixed and in between there is another mantra, such a combination is called *samputikarana* because you are 
arresting the bija inside by prefixing & suffixing a bija mantra.

When the mula mantra is pre-fixed with another mula mantra, it is called yojana and
when the mula mantra is suffixed with another mula mantra, it is called pallava.

So, in the case of the combination of 1 rudra trishati namavali + 1 lalita trishati namavali, 
that combination is called yojana or saMyOjana. 

If the archana is done as 1 rudra trishati namavali + 1 lalita trishati namavali + 1 rudra trishati namavali (this one is the prefixed one), then this combination is called 
samputikarana.

Hope it is clear.

//
I also heard, similar to Samputika, Triputika mantras exists.If it so, can
the readers pls.enlighten me about that.

//

In mantra shastra, IMHO, there is nothing like triputikarana. However, most of the people are coining a different set of combination where 3 different mula mantras are joined together. 

For instance: gAyatri mUla mantra + mahAmrityunjaya + jAtavedase durga mantra.

This typical combination is called triputikarana vidya. However, this is strictly called as
saMyOjana only.

regs,
sriram
