Namaste,

Krisshna-tila is considered very holy. One should not spill it on the floor as it is said the if one puts one's foot on the Krishna-tila he has commits a papa, equivalent to Brahma-hatya.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Question about Rudra Trishati

I don't think Tila will cause ashoucha. I have seen black Tila is used
in Sankalpa for some Ganapati Pooja and they use Black Tila in homa
also. They won't wash the hands afterwards.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I did not say use of krishna tila itself causes ashoucha. For that matter 
main dravya for the rudra hOma is Ajya mishrita tila vreehi.  I just 
said, after the AjyAhuti to rudra, mantrOkta devata-s, pitrus, (like in 
jayAdi hOma in yajurvedeeya agnimukha) we would wash our hands by saying 
apa upa sprushya. I thought reason for this is rudra is smashANa vAsi. I 
heard that some orthodox srivaishNava-s, if they accidentally have the 
shiva linga darshana or shiva temple, immediately they go home and take 
bath as they have seen the smashANavAsi rudra :-)) But I donot know how 
far it is true.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
