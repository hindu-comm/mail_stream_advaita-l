Namaste

Siva can make Pativrata Strees like Rishi Patnis to lose control and
run after him leaving back the husbands.

"According to a narrative, the Balakhilyas, a group of dwarf sages
worshipped Shiva in darukavana for long time. To test their devotion
and patience, Shiva came to the Darukavana as an digambara (nude)
ascetic, wearing only Nagas[serpants] in his body. Wives of sages were
attracted and ran after the ascetic, leaving back their husbands.
Sages got very disturbed and frustruated with this. They lost their
patience and cursed ascetic to loose his linga. Shivalinga fell on the
earth and whole world trembled. Brahma and Vishnu came to Shiva,
requested him to save earth from destruction and take back his linga.
Shiva consoled them and took back his linga.(Vamana Purana Ch.6 and
45) Shiva promised his divine presence in Darukavana as Jyotirlinga
for ever. Later Darukavana became favourate place of Nagas and Vasuki
worshipped Shiva here for long and there after the Jyotirlinga came to
be known as Nagnath or Nageshvara."
