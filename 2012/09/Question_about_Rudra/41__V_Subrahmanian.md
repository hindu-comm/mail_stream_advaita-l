Dear Gopal,

In all such traditions there are what can be called: radicals and
moderates.  I have personally seen and reported here about the beautiful
shrine for 'Rudra devaru' as it is called by Madhwas, at the pUrNaprajna
vidyApITha, Bangalore, consecrated by the Pejawar Seer.  They do a very
devout pUja regularly at the shrine.  Sri Rudra chanting goes on there, by
an audio CD.  There are vedic pundits among Madhwas too who must have
learned the Sri Rudra too as part of their adhyayana.  I do not think they
are averse to Shiva since for them Shiva is 'manaHkAraka' whose grace is
prayed for to attain pure devotion to Vishnu by Madhwas.  Sri Purandaradasa
has composed soul-stirring songs on Shiva and praises him as the foremost
bhakta of Vishnu.

Such odd behaviour can be seen only among selected few but there are many
who are more broad minded.  In fact I heard Sri VeLukkuDi Krishnan Swami
addressing srivaishnavas (maybe on his tour to the US and Canada) saying:
People say 'we visit all temples and therefore why you (srivaishnavas) too
should not visit Shiva and shiva parivara temples?  Our reply should be: we
are devoted to Vishnu and we stick to our one-pointed devotion to Him
only.'  So that is the kind of teaching they give and some people take it
seriously and apply it in their lives.  They quote some Azhwar's works and
say: rather than vishnu bhaktas being devoted to Shiva, it is Shiva who
should be 'careful' with vishnu bhaktas...and so on...'  One can see
fanaticism in some vishnu bhaktas' works.
