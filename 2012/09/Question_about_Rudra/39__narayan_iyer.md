My opinion is that these are purely urban legends, whether told by a scholar or not. 
If questioned back by the Siva temple staffer, as to why a pativratA (Sri Ramanujacharya)
was walking down the street of a parapuruSha (Siva temple) I do not think Sri Ramanujacharya
would have had a satisfactory counter or why Sri Ramanujacharya could not foresee the downpour.
