Dear Sri Venkatesh Murthy
Rudra Thrisathi is nothing but the namakam portion  of Sri Rudram commencing 
from the second anuvakam to the ninth.Sri Rudram is from Krishna Yajur Veda 
and therefore to be treated at par with Vedadhyanam.Rudra Thrisathi is easy 
to utter as it is rendered in the form of a namavali.R.Krishnamoorthy.
