What is this Tila Akshata? It may be Tila and Rice mixed.  We should
not use normal Akshate?

Yes, tilAkshata means raw rice and tila mixed.  rudra is smashANa vAsi, 
hence we use tila (like we use in pitru kArya) mixed with tandula.  We 
give tarpaNa also with this tilAkshata 'bhavaM devaM tarpayAmi, sharvaM 
devaM tarpayAmi etc. and their patni-s also bhavasya devasya 
patneestarpayAmi, sharvasya devasya patneestarpayAmi etc. I think because 
of rudra is smashANa vAsi, after offering AjyAhuti in hOma, we would wash 
our hands (apa upa sprushya) to get rid of ashoucha. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
