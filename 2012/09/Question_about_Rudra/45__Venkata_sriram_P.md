Namaste,

//
lalita triSati is comprised of names starting from the 15 letters of the panchadaSaakshari maha-mantra of Lalita Tripura Sundari. This is from mantra Saastra, not from vEda like Siva triSati, and hence does not have swara-s.

A small correction.

This is not shiva trishati but rudra trishati only.Shiva trashati is in matsya purANa which is shukrAchArya
prOkta.  shukrAchArya understakes *dhUma vrata*.  Pleased
with the penance of shukrAchArya, shiva blesses with His
vision.  In ecstasy, shukrAchArya praises Shiva with
300 names which is known as *shiva trishati*.

Regs,
sriram
