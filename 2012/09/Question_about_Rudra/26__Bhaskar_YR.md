If I'm right, the rudra trishati can be recited for archana purpose
while using a bilwa/tulsi leaf for each name. 

> yes, ashtOttara (108 names of shiva) and krama pAtha also can be done 
for the rudra archana vidhi.  And for the bilwArchana, tridaLam, 
triguNAkAram, trinetrancha triyAyudhaM, trijanma pApasaMhAram eka bilvaM 
shivArpaNam stOtra-s also can be recited. 

However, in the sri rudra japa aka Rudraprashnaha abhishekam must be done 
to the Shiva
linga continuosly till the end of the japa(namaka+chamaka). 

>  yes, both namaka & chamaka will be recited for the rudrAbhishekaM. 
However, in some parts of the South India, (in Bangalore Ritvika prapancha 
:-)) namaka is used for the rudra shOdashOpachAra pooja (like purusha 
sUkta), for example, for dhUpa we chant 'vijyaM dhanuH kapardino', for 
nirAnjana ' namaste astu bhagavan vishweshvarAya, and for the maNtra 
pushpa 'drApe andhasaspate' maNtra'.  And in hOma-s, during  vasOrdhAra we 
recite 'shanchame' (3rd anuvAka of chamaka prashna).  So, viniyOga of 
these maNtra-s not only restricted to only rudrAbhishekaM. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
