I heard from a talk by Sri VeLukkuDi Krishnan Swami, a noted scholar of the
Srivaishnava sampradaya that when Sri Ramanuja was walking the street of a
town there was a very heavy downpour.  When someone from a Shiva temple
there called him in to rest for a while till the rain stopped, Ramanuja is
reported to have replied:  A pativratA will not go to a parapuruSha.  In
the same way I will not enter a temple other than Vishnu's.
