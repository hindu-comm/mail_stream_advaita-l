Namaste,

This is a clear sign that Sri Ramanujacharya did not read the Skandopanishad, where it is said that Vishnu is the heart of Shiva and Shiva is the heart of Vishnu. Probably he did not even read the Mahabharata, which Vedavyasa, on his own admission, composed for the benefit of the laypersons, including woman. The Mahabharata has Arjuna's prayer to Lord Shiva, where Arjuna said Shiva is Hari and Hari is Shiva. We the Yajurvedi brahmanas from the eastern part of India chant the verse in our puja as follows:

om namah shivaya vishnurupine vishnave shivarupine
namo anadishaya namo hari haratmane.

Regards,
Sunil KB

I heard from a talk by Sri VeLukkuDi Krishnan Swami, a noted scholar of the
Srivaishnava sampradaya that when Sri Ramanuja was walking the street of a
town there was a very heavy downpour. When someone from a Shiva temple
there called him in to rest for a while till the rain stopped, Ramanuja is
reported to have replied: A pativratA will not go to a parapuruSha. In
the same way I will not enter a temple other than Vishnu's.
