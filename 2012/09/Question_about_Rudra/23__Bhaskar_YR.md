Dear Sri Venkatesh Murthy
Rudra Thrisathi is nothing but the namakam portion  of Sri Rudram 
commencing 
from the second anuvakam to the ninth.Sri Rudram is from Krishna Yajur 
Veda 
and therefore to be treated at par with Vedadhyanam.Rudra Thrisathi is 
easy 
to utter as it is rendered in the form of a namavali

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Yes, it starts from namO hiraNyabAhave namaH with intonations.  So, it is 
as good as veda pArAyaNa.  But lalitA trishati is not like that.  It is 
both in stOtra rUpa & nAmAvaLi but without any svara-s.  Normally we chant 
this in rudrArchana vidhi along with krama & ghana pAta of the namaka. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
