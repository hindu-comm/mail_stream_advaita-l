Hare Krishna

I want know how does Rudra Sukta, and Sri Rudram differ in esoteric
meaning.

> rudra sUkta is Rigvedeeya and rudra 'prashna' or shatarudreeya is 
taitireeya saMhita maNtra.  And as far as esoteric meaning is concerned, 
all veda-s point to ekamevaadviteeya tatva i.e. parabrahman, hence no 
difference.

And also some people opine that Sri Rudram is not a sukta, if its not 
Sukta
unlike Purusha Sukta or Sri Sukta, what is it called.

>  As said above, it is called rudra / namaka prashna or shatarudreeya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
