I heard we have to say the famous Panchakshari Mantra first joined
with Sakti Mantra Om Hreem. We should not say Panchakshari only

//

If hreem is added, the mantra becomes shakti panchAkshari mantra or else
it is shuddha panchAkshari only. panchAkshari with praNava is called 
shaivashaDakshari mantra.

traivarNikAs are allowed to do japa of panchAkshari with praNava whereas
strIs & shUdrAs are allowed to do japa without praNava. They can added
prAsAda bija instead of praNava. 

regs,
sriram
