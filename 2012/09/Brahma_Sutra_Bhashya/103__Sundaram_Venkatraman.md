There is a translation on Brahma Sutra Bhashya by Mr. Vasudeo Mahadeo Apte
which seems to be very highly regarded and is recommended on the
bibliography pages of most books on Advaita Vedanta. Has anyone gone
through this translation and if so is it in anyway superior to the more
easily available translations like that of Swami Gambhirananda? Would be
very grateful to receive the views of members on this.

Many thanks and regards,
Venkat
