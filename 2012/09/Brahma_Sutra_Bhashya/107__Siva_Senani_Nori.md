Sri Rajaram

It is most kind of you to offer the same. I hope you don't need to pay the infamous congestion charge and steep parking charges to be able to access the bookshop.

As per the conditions of Abe Books, I need to wait for two days for the bookseller to contact me, get his confirmation that he would supply the book at the contracted terms, and then pay. I will wait for the bookseller to contact me and will first try to convince him to go for the equivalent of an to-collect international shipping, failing which I will contact you to close the transaction.

Yours truly
N. Siva Senani

>I read up and figured out that Abe Books is an online marketplace, i.e., there are a number of book sellers who will list their books on the site and the transaction is between these book stores and users. Nowbook sellers can also listused books, companion books etc., with their own descriptions; if, the buyer does not know the trade-jargon, he just lost his money. Even so, I thought I should order. The problem was that there are quite a few complaints - on the internet - that Abe Books have taken the money but that the book was not delivered. Apparently, the response of Abe Books was poor. The user agreement of Abe Books says that there are not responsible for anything, and that if onestill wants to litigate, the jurisdiction is only Vancouver, British Columbia. In India, where the sellers can be quite shady, we use VPP or cash on delivery. It is the seller who takes the risk of the buyer returning the consignment without taking delivery (unlikely
>that the buyer would waste so much time ordering, if he was not serious). So I placed my order with 'cash' as the payment option.

>The bookseller is located at Charing Cross Road, London (I know only the Ooty Charing Cross :-)) and I live in Hyderabad, India. I don't know if VPP (Value Parcel Post, where one takes delivery of the book and pays the amount to postman) is available in international shipping. I wonder if any member can help me and suggest any other way short of paying the required Rs. 5,000 and wait with crossed fingers.
