Actually, I am trying to get a copy of this one particular translation (Apte) in an attempt to compare the translations of thebhashya on the chatussutri. It is published by Popular BookDepot. This is one of the sevenEnglish translations. I got the others (given below) in either a book form or as an ebook, but not this one.So, if anybody canhelp me get it, I would be most thankful.Kindly help.
Some knownEnglish translations of Sankara's bhashya are:

1. Banerjea, K. M., Rev., “The Brahma Sutras with the
Commentary of Sankaracharya, Translated into English”, Biblotheca Indica: A
Collection of Oriental Works, published by the Asiatic Society of Bengal, New
Series No. 214, Asiatic Soceity of Bengal, Calcutta, 1870.
2. Thibaut, George, “The Vedānta Sūtras with the Commentary
by Śaṅkarāchārya, Part I”, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1890.
3. Vireswarananda, Swami, “Brahma-sutras with Text,
Word-for-word Translation, English Rendering, Comments and Index”, Advaita
Ashrama, Mayavati, Almora, Himalayas, 1936.

Publication League, Rishikesh, 1949.

The Brahma-sūtras” Vol. One, Booksellers' Publishing Co., Bombay, 1954.
6. Apte, V. M.. “Brahma-Sutra Sankara-bhashya, Translated

7. Gambhirananda, Swami “Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya” of Sri Śaṅkarāchārya”, 7thImpression,
Advaita Ashrama, 5, Delhi Entelly Road, Calcutta, 2000. (First edition, 1965).
There is one by Belvalkar, but he seems to have translated only the first and second padas of the second adhyaya, mainly for the benefit of University students. This was first published in 1938 and there was a 'third edition' (not a reprint) in 1988. If somebody knows whether Belvalkar also translated the first adhyaya, again I would be most thankful to know of the same.

There are a few other translations - which either have Sankara's text embedded within, or have only a small or largepart of the bhashya translated, or have presented material mainly based on Sankara's bhashya but mixed with the translator's own interpretation as well and presented in a different order, which might be mentioned here: 

1. Deussen, Paul (Authorised Translation by Charles
Johnston), “The System of the Vedānta According to Bādarāyaṇa's Brahma-sūtras
and Śaṅkara's Commentary thereon set
forth as a Compendium of the Dogmatics of Brahmanism from the Standpoint
of Śaṅkara”, The Open Court Publishing

All the above are available - either in print form or ebook form.

There is one English translation of Brahmsutra bhashya by S. Tattvabhushan, now sold by Cosmos (a rip-off publisher; O make sure to check before I buybooks published by them) and MLBD. This was originally written in 1904 and named Ramamohanabhashya after Raja Ram Mohun Roy, who was the guru of Tattvabhushan. I bought this, but am yet to read it. The catussutri part is more like vritti - actually vrittis like BrahmAmritavarshiNI go further than Tattvabhushan's book. He is supposed to generally follow Sankara, but I did not really read the portions which would make that clearer.
