There would be seven rounds to cover the seven kāṇḍas of the samhitā part of the Krishna Yajurveda and three rounds to cover the Brāhmaṇa, and one to cover the Āraṇyaka and Upaniṣat portions.

Ghanapāṭhiswould recite the ghanapāṭha of the panasasin the samhita; Kramapāṭhis would recite the kramapāṭha. Scholars of other branches of Veda, if present, would recite at the beginning or end of each round from the relevant portions of the particular branch.
