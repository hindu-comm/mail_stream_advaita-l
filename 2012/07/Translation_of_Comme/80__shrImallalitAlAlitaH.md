bhAShya of shrI-shabara-svAmI is published in it's entirety from at least
three places. The famous one is Ananda-Ashrama-edition. While others are
from vidyA-vilAsa-press and The Asiatic Society.
Ananda-Ashrama had published shloka-vArttika, tantra-vArttika and Tup-TIkA
along with bhAShyam.

shloka-vArttia has many commentaries, including kAshikA of sucharita-mishra
(trivendram), tAtparya-TIkA of umbeka-bhaTTa (Madras University),
nyAya-ratnAka of pArtha-sArathI-mishra (chaukhambA) and bhUShaNa of
varadAchArya(Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, New Delhi).
tantra-vArttika has also a few published commentaries including nyAya-sudhA
of someshvara-bhaTTa, etc.
Tup-TIkA has tantra-ratnam published from vArANasI.

I've seen English translation of shloka-vArttika, tantra-vArttika by
ga~NgA-nAtha-jhA.
