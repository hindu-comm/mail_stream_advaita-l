Namaste,

The sloka vartika of gangAnAth jhA can be downloaded here:

BTW, Shri Bharati Tirtha Swamigal is authority in this subject. His Holiness completed
the sloka vartika in30 days of time. 

My memories are still clear when Brahmasri VK Dongre Ji used to teach sloka vartika & bhATTa deepika simultaneously. Dongreji owing to his ill-health couldn't stay too long in Sringeri. So, morning class was sloka vartika and evening class was bhATTa deepika. Shri Bharati Tirtha Swamigal used to repeat the morning lesson of sloka vartika same day
in the evening prior to commencement of bhATTa deepika; and used to repeat the bhATTa deepika lesson the next day morning before commencement of next lesson of sloka vartika. Like this, His Holiness completed both sloka vArtika and bhATTa deepika in a month's time.

My prostrations to the illustrous Acharya Parampara of Sringeri....
