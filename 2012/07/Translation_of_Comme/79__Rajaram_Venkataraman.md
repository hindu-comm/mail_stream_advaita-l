Dear Friends,

Hare Krishna. I would like to know if there are critical editions and
translations of commentaries on Jaimini's Mimamsa Sutras. The following are
listed:

1. Upavarsha
2. Bodhayans
3. Bhavadasa
4. Sabhara
5. Bhartrmitra

Are there other commentaries? I would also like to know if there are
scholars on this list or those that you might know who are experts or
research scholars in mimamsa. Thank you.

Best Regards
Rajaram Venkatramani
