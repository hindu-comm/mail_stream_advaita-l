Wirh reference to the posting by Swani Sarvabuthananda,regarding the 
above,the Parasarasmrithi is not applicable in Kaliyuga,as it contains 
many taboos like the brothther's wife getting married to her brother in 
law,which was followed before.What we are following is Dharma sastra of 
Manu with Grhya sutras.
N.Srikanta.
