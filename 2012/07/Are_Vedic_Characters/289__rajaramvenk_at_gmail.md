It strengthens the position that shruti is handed down through oral tradition from the time of creation. The historicity is secondary. If real Nachiket lived and followed the script, great. We don't have evidence for historical Nachiket. If not he exists forever in the shruti mantra for which we have evidence. 

There is an argument of kalpa bheda to explain the differences. If it is so,  who remembered the stories from different kalpa? If we say it is Brahma, then we go to the same (correct) theory that entire vedas was revealed to him including the variant readings at the time of creation.  

Needless to say that this does not apply to literature that were written based on Vedas.

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Are Vedic Characters and events fictitious?

Namaste ji,

Interestingly another episode of the akhyayika involving Naciketa, his
father & Yama appears in the Taittiriya Brahmana. But this time the
teachings and details are slightly different from the Katha Upanishad
version. I am not sure if this would change our perception of historicity &
shruti.
