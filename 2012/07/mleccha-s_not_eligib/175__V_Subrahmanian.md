I wish to clarify that in that particular case where the Sringeri
Paramacharya asked that foreigner to go back and pursue his native
religion, the man had wanted to 'convert' to Hinduism.  The Acharya had
apparently thought of the impossibiity of according a particular varNa to
him in the event of acceding his request for converting.  Whereas in the
case of Paul Brunton it was his desire to pursue spirituality.  Hence the
Kanchi Acharya's suggestion/guidance to him to go to Bhagavan Ramana.
There has been a case where a French national wanted guidance in spriritual
dhyana and the Sringeri Paramacharya even blessed him with a picture of His
Guru (HH Narasimha Bharati SwaminaH) for dhyana.
