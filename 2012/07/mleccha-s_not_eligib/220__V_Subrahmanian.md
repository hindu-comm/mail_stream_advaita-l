Dear Ravi,

This brings up the question of vasanas.  One can never predict what vasanas
are lurking in the subconscious level and when they will attack a person.

Even though a person has taken a brahmana janma, which is itself karma
phala alone, still it can so happen that owing to an overpowering latent
tendency, vasana, one can be compelled to behave in a way that is
unbecoming of his varNa.  The Bh.Gita 3rd chapter says: indriyANi,
manobuddhiH asya (kAma/krodhasya) adhiShThAnam uchyate...the senses, mind
and intellect are the abodes where kAma and krodha reside.  One must
exercise extreme care with these.  Shankara has said: sunimpuNAnAmapi
sUkShmAparAdhadarshanAt - even with respect to very careful persons one can
see subtle lapses.  'na kashchit nAparAdhyati'  (in ramayana)? it means: no
one is free from defect. न कश्चिन्नापराध्यति. Na kashchinnaaparaadhyati. To
err is human, there is none who has not erred some time or other.
