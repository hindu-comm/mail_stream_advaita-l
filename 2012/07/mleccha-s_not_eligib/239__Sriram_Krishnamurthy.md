Dear all,
HH Sringeri Jagadguru talks about eligibility in the following manner,
suppose a 10th Std takes  a 8th standard question  paper given by the
inviligitar and writes it well enough, his mark will be zero only.
      The investiture of the thread ceremony to the person contrary to
his Svadharma is like the Guru in this case the invigilator, giving
the 8th std paper to 10th std student and the student writing it well.
Bhagavad Gita clearly explains about one's Svadharma. Gita furthers
says Paradharmo Bhaya vahaha, it means there is the possibility of
contrary results. There can be no exception granted to the Dharma
Shastra. Shastra means the Veda, vedangas and includes the smritis.

   The crux of Coimbatore speech is that the Jagadguru is being asked
by various people to write a new Dharma Shastra for which Jagadguru
replies that he cannot rewrite the Dharma Shastras. The authority of
Dharma Shastras is there to stay. Many ask him they are not able
perform  the mandatory Sandhyavandana, Aupasana etc in this age. He
emphasizes that they have to performed.

Hari Om Tat Sat,
Sriram
