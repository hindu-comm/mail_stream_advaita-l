The reason for telling him that is because pApa causes injury in this life 
and the next.  (As part of the Hindu fold I expect Shivashankara 
believes that.) As long as there is doubt, one should refrain from 
potentially dangerous actions.  I don't see why one shouldn't wait for 
clarification.  If a guru says "You have to write me a check for $10,000 
before you can proceed to the next spiritual level"  (And we all know 
there are such gurus some of whom call themselves Advaitins.) would it be 
a breach of dharma to ask why he is asking such a thing before handing 
over ones savings?  What kind of friend would I be if I let my friend 
be tricked like that?
