Dear Shri Shivashankar,

>From what I have heard extensively the talks of Sri Velukkudi Krishnan, the
famous exponent of Vishistadvaita, the term 'Ramanuja dasan' goes with
everyone of the Srivaishnava sampradaya without the varna/gender
specification.  It does not require upanayana, shikha, etc.  Tripundra
might be specified but not a must.  One who has Vishnu bhakti, one whose
heart bleeds on the sight of his fellow beings' suffering, etc. are the
qualities of a Vaishnava.  The scholar often cites the famous song rendered
beautifully by M.S.Subbulakshmi  'Vaishnava jana to..' of the Gujarati poet
Narsi Mehta to explain who a true Vaishnava is.  He has stressed that as a
Ramanuja dasa there is no difference between one and another.  But he is
also very clear about the varna-dharma that prevails within the
srivaishnava sampradaya regarding right to veda study and such other
matters.

What I wish to say is just that a 'Ramanuja dasa' can be anyone without
having to be of a particular jati or nationality or gender.
