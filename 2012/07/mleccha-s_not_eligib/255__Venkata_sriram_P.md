Dear Praveenji,

///

Finally,let us worry for adhikaris not following the niyama,for an anadhikari,Ishwara will guide in due course!!

//

A fantastic statement. You resonate with my guruji's words.

The jnAna mArga is the uttama mArga and to tread that path, anyone can follow irrespective of varNAs. The problem is with karma kANDa only. The vaidika karma
kANDa, only traivarNikAs can follow whereas the tAntrika & paurANika paddhati,
shUdrAs & strIs are also eligible. 

BTW, it needs a special mention that my guruji & paramaguruji learnt yOga rahasyAs 
and advaita jnAna from shUdrA yoginis also. 

There was a great shUdra yOgini by name *tikka lakshamamma*. She used to be spotted
around dustbins and relish the left-over meals in the dustbin. In the dead midnight, she 
used to be in samAdhi. At times, she practiced a strange yogic feat called *khaNDa yOga*. Quite often people used to spot her practicing this in midnight. Several of her severed body parts used to be scattered everywhere and early morning her body used 
be in normal position, intact. My guruji & paramaguruji and even my parameshti guruji
used to lovingly call her as *avva* which means Mother. She belonged to the untouchable
caste in Andhra Pradesh. 

Brahmasri Jandhyala Subramanya Sastry Garu of Bandar (Machilipatnam) whom my guruji
used to admire for his shrotriyatva and brahmaniSTatva, used to visit a great yogini belonging to shUdra varNa who used to live in a small village called *penumatsa*. She was
lovingly called *penumatsa mahAyogini*. On the last day, when she was about to shed
her mortal coil (she infact achieved brahmarandhra bhEdana siddhi), Subramanya Sastry
Garu visited Her and was initiated into dattatreya upAsana. Sri Jandhyala Subramanya Sastry Garu and my guruji as very close friends. 

So, it is only for vaidika karmakANDa, the shUdrAs are anadhikArIs. Barring this vaidika karma,they too have eligibility in practicingkarma, bhakti & jnAna and reach the highest
pinnacle in jnAna niSTa.

regs,
sriram
