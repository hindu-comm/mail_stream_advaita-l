I might be adding a small dose of complication to the discussion.
Upanayana is done in the method stated specifically for a particular veda.
For example the Rg and Yajur veda upanayanam is different from each other.
And the boy is taught the pravara soon after the upanayana.  Here he has to
say: Rk shAkhAdhyAyI, etc. along with gotra, rishi, sutra, etc.  And the
shastra says: the veda that the boy's father, grand father and other
forefathers studied is the veda of this boy.  When the varNa, gotra, veda,
etc. of a particular person are unknown how will the purohit conduct the
upanayanam?
