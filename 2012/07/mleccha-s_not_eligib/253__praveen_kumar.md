Vidhyashankarji,


Please do not quote what goes around you in USA or some part which in first
place not dharmically recognised
for living to substantiate how things are done.
Jaldharji is quite right in his views and these topics (I have personal
regard and respect as
he is quite knowledgeable in many topics)should not be argued for the other
side of the fence.Kindly put
a full stop to the arguments why rules have to be broken.
If an acharya/guru has erred in his duty,he shall be crestfallen.This is
something being made amply clear
in all the scriptures.Just because some guru/purohitha has erred in some
part of the world,please do not
keep quoting.
