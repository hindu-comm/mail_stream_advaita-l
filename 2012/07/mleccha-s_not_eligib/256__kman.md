I held back responding to this thread for so long. I could not take it any
more. So here goes.

Thankfully, there are no door keepers, probably it was designed that way,
as they knew that
natural evolution cannot be stopped by Smrithi/Shuri.

For all you 1% ers clutching the Smrithis/Shruti can never attain Brhman
for sure as Shankara himself has said. Even Shankara got enlightened only
by a Mleecha, you can make stories that he was Shiva himself, even then
Shiva did not find it beneath himself to be a Mleecha. So understand that
enlightenment will not come in your cocoon i.e Shruti/Smrithi.

This varnashrama held us down for 100s of years. It is hard to believe that
educated illiterates here
talk about varna and Jati at birth. If that is so science could have found
it by now.

You all are counting the whole for the donut as they say. On one hand
preach that we are all one
and then turn around and say we are of 4 varnas. Stupid is what comes to
mind.
So much for Advaita, you 1% ers are a digrace.to humanity. You are nothing
less than KKK or the right wingers.

This news group has started stinking like a pig. God save Advaita.
