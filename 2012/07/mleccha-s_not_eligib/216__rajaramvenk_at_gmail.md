If you don't accept the vaidhika view of creation, you need an alternate vaidhika view of the origins. That does not exist. As discussed many times before mixing evolution and creation is a heady cocktail - best avoided unless you want the hangover of scientific training to veil your vaidhika view. It is not too fantastic to believe that brahmanas etc were created in full form. We believe that Lakshmi appeared as a young girl from the ocean not as an infant.  We accept svambhu murtis appearing in full form in many places.

From the above it is clear that all the three varNa-s for whom Vedic rites
are prescribed were created 'at once'. 

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I think, instead of taking the literal meaning, we should see the broader 
picture from the vedAntik perspective.  i.e. from the veda purusha 
everything originated and he pervades & goes beyond it also (sabhumim 
vishvatO vrutvA, atyatishTadashAngulaM, purusha evedagaM sarvaM, 
yadbhutaM, yaccha bhavyaM etc. in purusha sUkta).  As we know, 'srushti 
krama' is not uniform even in shruti and it is only upAya to saying 
something else.  So, taking these things literally without keeping the 
sarvavyApakatva of brahman in mind would lead to further confusions like : 
 whether these varNa-s generated/originated in groups all of a sudden from 
him, whether brAhmaNa, kshatriya & vaishya born from that purusha's mukha, 
bAhu, Uru respectively  with yagnOpaveeta on their shoulders and holding 
samits, dharba, sword in their hands?   and shUdra-s without  this and 
with only service mentality to the other three varNa-s originated from the 
top portion of this purusha !!??  and what about foreigners who are 
neither belong to any of these four varNa-s?? 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
