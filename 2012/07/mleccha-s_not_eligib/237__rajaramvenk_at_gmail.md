Dear Sri Subrahmanian, I think the matter has to be looked at carefully and frankly discussed by traditional scholars. The veda of the father etc. can be interpreted to mean that the veda inherited through oral tradition. Before the Vedas were divided, one perhaps studied all of it. Leave alone what happens after upanayanam. What is there before to say that a boy (won't go in to girl issue as yet) is conferred the rights only because of his jati? We see it being conferred by relatives when parents don't exist and if so why not by a brahmana to anyone he thinks is qualified?

I might be adding a small dose of complication to the discussion.
Upanayana is done in the method stated specifically for a particular veda.
For example the Rg and Yajur veda upanayanam is different from each other.
And the boy is taught the pravara soon after the upanayana.  Here he has to
say: Rk shAkhAdhyAyI, etc. along with gotra, rishi, sutra, etc.  And the
shastra says: the veda that the boy's father, grand father and other
forefathers studied is the veda of this boy.  When the varNa, gotra, veda,
etc. of a particular person are unknown how will the purohit conduct the
upanayanam?
