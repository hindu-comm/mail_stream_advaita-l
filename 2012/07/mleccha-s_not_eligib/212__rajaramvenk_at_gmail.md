If you are interested in the legal arguments that won the case against the most powerful opponents of Veda Dharma in modern times, you can get it from Dr. Kalyan. He also happens to be an advaitin and you may find other common interests. In a nutshell, it is enough to prove that Ramar Setu in an ancient cultural heritage and destroying it would hurt the sentiments of those who believe in it. It is the same argument that we should use to protect apaureshya veda. On the back of my article / book and current UNESCO approval of oral traditions as cultural heritage, the plan is to get constitutional protection for vaidhika dharma in countries where it was practised. 

BTW, at the start of this cycle Rama Katha was known and jatis adopted protection of Ramar Sethu, a natural formation, as their dharma. (We can say that Bhuma Devi manifested this structure in remembrance of Her Lord Rama's pastime of rescuing her). The very fact Dwaraka, Ayodhya etc. co-exist shows that people from the start of the yuga associated the real places with those in the sastras.

Recently you asked about the ancient Dwaraka remains submerged.  Ramar
Sethu is a similar one, going back to an even earlier era, yuga, than the
former.  Does this somehow say that a praLaya destroying everything and a
subsequent sriShTi beginning with new things are myths?  Any explanations?
