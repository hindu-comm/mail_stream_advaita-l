Dear Sri Praveen,

I never said birth is an accident - no event is. I clearly acknowledged
that varna like the colour of the skin or the eyes is acquired at birth as
a result of karma in previous births. I think it is the nature of sukshuma
sarira. I also agree that jati is an indicator of varna. However, I point
out the historical fact that jatis have changed. Mandal Commission reported
3000 jatis whereas Manu Smrti reported 265 (if my memory serves right).
Manu himself talks about creation of new jatis as a result intermingling of
Varnas. He also gives the seven generation rule for a jati to change varna
 through matrimony. There will always be four Varnas. There can be
countless jatis and madhams (religions). Before Mohammad came, there was no
Islam. But the four Varnas were there and will be forever. Humans will
belong to one of these four Varnas.

I am not talking about outward sattvic nature. It is the nature of one's
sukshuma sarira and well determined through horoscope. I know that some
traditional scholars hold the position that paradesis can't get  adhikara
for vaidhika karma. It is for them to show evidence based on shruti and
smrti. All the countries described in the sruti and smrti had all the our
Varnas thriving. AFAIK, There is no rule prohibiting paradesis whereas
there are rules prohibiting sudras. Without showing the rules, you can't
argue that dharma is violated.

I would also ask for specific rules prohibiting upanayanam for girls.

Best Regards
Rajaram Venkatarmani
