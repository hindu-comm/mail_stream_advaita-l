Even in this case he would fail in his exams :-)

This is Samanya Dharma. We are  talking about Shastra Vihita Dharma.

>  And you could see the shAstra vihita dharma & its paripAlana suffered a 
violation or exception (!!??)in the dvApara yuga itself in the form of 
sAmAnya dharma.  That said, I am not parting with the veda vihita 
dharmAcharaNa..

> but instead to asking Mr. Paul Brunton to go back to his country and
>follow his 'svadharma', H.H. asked him to meet ramaNa maharshi why??

It was not Sringeri Jagadguru but HH CS the Kanchi Paramacharya

> if you see the work hindu dharma, His HH CS, kanchi paramAchArya too, 
has been approached by pundits to change the dharma shAstra which they 
thought obselete, but HH never agreed for any amendments.  But asked a 
westerner to go to a hindu saint instead of asking him to follow his 
svadharma..I hope you would agree His HH CS is equally authoritative when 
it comes to hindu dharma & its injunctions and he took this decision as an 
exception case after the interaction with this westerner on 1:1 basis. 

>>  while on the subject, I would like to say, our list member Sri
>>Shivashankara prabhuji (erstwhile Mr. Stig Lundgren) can be considered 
as
>>an exceptional case considering his shraddha, bhakti in hindu culture &
>>rituals.

When the Sringeri Jagadguru himself says he is not eligible to write a
new Dharma Shastras where are we, small beings to validate exceptions.

>  Please note, I am not saying we have to validate these exceptions and 
with that exceptional cases we should try to amend the rules stipulated in 
smruti texts.  What I am trying to say is there is an exception and that 
exception has been entertained & accepted by even the most authoritative & 
respective personalities in our vedic tradition. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
