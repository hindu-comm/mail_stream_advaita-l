I also believe this albeit for different reasons.  I submit to you the 
reformist mania for making Brahmanas out of anyone is a symptom of a rigid 
and uninformed view of the shastras.

>From rape to adultery there are other factors than conversion that can 
lead to genetic admixture.  But you have, perhaps inadvertently, brought 
up a valuable insight.  In pre-modern times most "conversions" happen at a 
group level -- an entire family or tribe change their affiliation at the 
same time.  This is why there are so many jatis with ambiguous varna 
status.

But here we are considering a different situation -- an individual 
changing his ideology.

You are comparing apples and pears.  The Ashkenazim are one jati of Jews. 
Overall within the spectrum of Jewish ethnicity there is just as much 
genetic variation as there is amongst Brahmanas or Hindus in general. 
Conversely specific Brahmana jatis such e.g. Kashmiri Pandits are as 
genetically distinct as Ashkenazi Jews.  And overall, a Tamil Brahmana has 
more in common genetically with a UP Brahmana than a Tamil Shudra.  See

The current theory as summarized here:
http://indology.wordpress.com/south-indians-north-indians-caste-system/

is that the modern Indian population is made of two distinguishable 
genetic bases which entered India from the northwest, Ancestral South 
Indians and later Ancestral North Indians.  Nearly all Modern Indians are 
an admixture of these two types. (The terms Aryan and Dravidian are not 
used as they are mostly cultural/political labels.  Anyway the purest 
"South Indians" are the Andaman & Nicobar Islanders who look nothing like 
Naicker or Karunanidhi.  Also note neither of these migrations can 
legitimately be called "invasions.")

And to answer your question it appears that those migrations had finished 
9000 years ago.  So the variation was there right from prehistory.

Are you referring to the dantakatha that Ramanuja "created" Brahmanas? 
This canard appears to have started in the 19th century.  (Vivekananda 
popularized it but did not originate it I think.)  Shrivaishnava scholars 
such as the late Rangapriya Swami deny it.  If you read the 
apashudradhikarana in the Shribhashya, it clearly shows that Ramanujas 
view on Vedadhikara was exactly the same as Shankaracharya.  See

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe48/sbe48131.htm and onwards.

I hope I have adequately shown to you that they were not "happening in the 
flow of history."

No.  But the question of upanayana and sandhya etc. is one of karma which 
has nothing to do with jnana.

Eligibility and fitness for what?  Adhikara is different for karma and 
jnana.
