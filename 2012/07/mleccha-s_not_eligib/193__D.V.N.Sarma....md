The whole of this discussion I am afraid is out of touch with the reality.
In India today there are hundreds and hundreds of castes in the Hindu fold.
Some claim themselves
to be brahmins like sthapatis, goldsmiths, carpenters and so on. To
determine the position
of these casts in to the fourfold varna frame is impossible. If you try to
attempt any such thing there will
be grave and even violent repercussions.

Majority of the brahmins (99%) are not following any smritis. They are
unlikely do so in future.
Why do not we confine our selves to our main concern Advaita?

regardsd,
Sarma.
