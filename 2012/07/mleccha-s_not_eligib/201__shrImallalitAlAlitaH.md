Services (sevA) is a good thing and these Missions are doing service for
their own spiritual gain and not to show that they are superior.
And, we are talking about actions of all according to shAstra-s, not of
only these societies. brahma-bandhu-s are in no way favorites to us.
But, instead of this fact they have scriptural support of prAyashchitta to
become pure, while these societies have not. That's the difference.
If you can't hear what is against shAstra in your organization, then at
least don't shout in a way which doesn't answers anything.
