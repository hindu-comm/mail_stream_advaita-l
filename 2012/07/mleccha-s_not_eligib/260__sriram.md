Dear Sri kman
My view is your tirade is meaningless.The whole issue was whether 
we-includes you also-can prescribe new standards for deciding the varna/jati 
and do away with what has been so far held by our scriptures-vedas and 
smrithies.It appears as unpalatable to stick to what has been held as right 
path in the changed circumstances of liberal thinking.As Hindus we believe 
in birth -death cycle and births are regarded as result of past karmas 
bad/good/or both.This was the fulcrum of all discussions and to be fair to 
the conservative stand point the position is unalterable.If one wants to 
deviate let him,but there is no sanction.You are angry and want to cast us 
all to Hell perhaps.And you call us stupid and what not.We are not playing 
number game here.If a mlecha wants to follow Hindhu principles he can do so 
without converting externally but observe in letter and spirit such 
principles which will earn him a next higher status in the next 
birth.Onemorething,our shastras are liberal in that punyam or papam accrue 
to one and all who follow the dharma prescribed for him.Probably you hold 
the view that it is all designed to oppress the lower varnas by the 
superior[!] varnas only based on births. R.Krishnamoorthy.
