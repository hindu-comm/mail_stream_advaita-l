Namaste Jaldhar

If you had been Shivashankar's friend, you would have advised him in a more
respectful manner. Your response appears to be rude, arrogant and
disrespectful. The weight of the vedic culture was not placed on your
shoulders for you to take the liberty to judge others. The least you could
have done is to apologise.

Jaldhar, if you have a baggage with Gurus who request cheques or 19th
century apologists, the right place to ventilate is with your therapist and
not in an august forum meant for a sacred wisdom as taught by shankara. As
mumukshus we should set good examples as what Krshna says in the Gita:

Whatsoever a great man does, other commoners do the same; whatever standard
he sets up, the world follows that. (3.21)
That speech which causes no pain, which is true, agreeable and beneficial;
as well as the practice of study of the scriptures,-is said to be austerity
of speech.  (17.15)

Just my views as a member of this list. I am sorry if my words hurt you.
