In case anyone is wondering who this kman character is, he pops up from 
time to time with incoherent, insult-filled ramblings (while lecturing 
others about ahimsa! LOL) but otherwise contributes nothing.  The only 
reason I am responding to this scurrilous post before I eject him is that 
there are several canards that reasonable people also sometimes believe.

...so this is an argument for not giving out Upanayanas yes?

You are refering to the dantakatha about Shiva Bhagavan appearing in the 
form of a Chandala in Kashi.  This is found in tikas on the mayapanchaka 
not in Shankaracharyas writings themselves.  If you care so much about 
Advaita Vedanta take the trouble to actually find out what it says.

And upanayana is the symbol of shrauta/smarta karma not enlightenment.

Science _has_ found it out.  I provided links to some of the research 
remember?  India has practiced endogamy for not hundreds but thousands of 
years through the highest points of its history and the lowest.  You can 
interpret the consequences of that however you like but the idea that jati
was ever about anything other than birth is a complete non-starter.

We aren't all one.  In fact the idea that we should all be fit into one 
mould smacks of fascism to me if we're going to be name-calling.

So you don't believe in oneness with the pig?  It's almost enough to think 
less of you.  Goodbye.
