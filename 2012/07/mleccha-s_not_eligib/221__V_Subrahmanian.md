There need not be anything funny about the literal taking of these
mantras.  I agree that the mukha, thigh, hands, feet, etc. of Brahman are
only figurative, even as the oceans are said to be His (urinary) bladder.
But the first humans can be admitted to be born as in their grown up forms
alone, just as it is admitted in the svarga nivaasi-s, etc.  The Bh.Gita
bhashya introduction says:  marIchyAdIn agre sRShTvA...for the purpose of
pravRtti dharma.  And in the Puranas too the prajApati-s produced the first
beings and they in turn brought forth the creation through regular off
springs.  BrahmA is said to have produced manu and shatarUpaa from himself
and through them the human race started multiplying.
