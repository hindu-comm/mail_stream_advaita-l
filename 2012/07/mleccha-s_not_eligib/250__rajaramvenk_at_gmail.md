Congratulations! I hope you have permission from family and elders. And you have considered the implications for your dependents, if any.

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] mleccha-s not eligible to take Hinduism??

I am going to join the sringeri mutt in a few
days. My intention is to create a sort of utopia for vaidik relegion. I
don't know how, I don't have a blueprint and I don't know if i am going to
be succesful. But I'll put my efforts honestly. And I believe, if we want
any solution to all the problems in the world, we have to take shelter in
the vedas.

praNAms Sri Amit prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Please accept my heartfelt  praNAms to you prabhuji.  The dedicated souls 
like your goodself is thousand times better than part time, lip service 
vedAntins like me prabhuji.  May the almighty guide you in your noble 
pursuit. 

praNAms again

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
