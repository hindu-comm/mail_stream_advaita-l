RV: You have to first verify if the bhavishya Purana you referred to is a
critical edition or an interpolation British India. And what it says. As
one keen on protecting the tradition, you should first see if traditional
scholars admit that there was a separate creation of mlechchas, tribals
etc. We owe it to our forefathers to show some critical thinking.  The Lord
only talks about four Varnas. If people go out of it due to non- adherence
(e.g. late marriage, late upanayanam, marriage etc.), then they may not
belong to any one of the Varnas but may still have some of he rights to
rites (e.g. Rathakaras). I have at length dealt with this in my reply to
Sri Jaladhar. Please read it carefully.

RV: Are you saying that matrimony is the only way to change Varna? If varna
can be changed by some means, then you have to concede that it is not 100%
tied to jati or the womb from which one is born. I have again delt with
jatis changing varna in my reply to Sri Jaladhar. Please read carefully.

RV:  The Lord talks about varna being the result of guna and karma. Of
course, guna is acquired at birth and is due to karma in previous lives. We
practically see that entire jatis share gunas. So, jati is an indicator of
guna. But where jati is not known or cannot indicate varna, astrology can.
Garga's coronation of Sivaji is an example. There is no evidence that the
lord created people who did not belong to one of the four Varnas. This is
not a traditional position unless you can show evidence from the works of
acharyas.
