sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Jaldhar Vyas prabhuji
Hare Krishna

What does Upanayana have to do with adhyatma?  It is a symbol of adhikara 
for karma. 

>  prabhuji, dont you think this samskAra is required to do sAdhana in 
'veda' mArga?? sAdhana in veda mArga includes nitya & naimittika karma-s 
and  for that dvijatva saMskAra is required is it not??  And IMHO, for the 
pratyaksha sAdhana-s like shravaNa, manana & nidhidhyAsaM, dvijatva or 
upanayana saMskAra is required as these sAdhana-s are directly related to 
vedAdhyayana & shAstra vAkya..Kindly correct me if I am wrong. 


Sadhakas in Advaita Vedanta stop wearing Yagnopavita even if 
they have been rigorously orthodox their entire lives. 

>  I am really surprised to see this statement from your goodself 
prabhuji.  And it is also surprising to me that  Sri vidyA prabhuji too 
has also seemed to agree to your above statement as he said except those 
personal advice to Sri shivashankara prabhuji, he has agreed to all your 
explanations/clarifications.  Do you mean to say an advaita vedAnta 
sAdhaka, just because he started to pursue his sAdhana in jnAna mArga, can 
become the 'saMskAraheena' or 'Ashrama bhrashta'??  Can he take out his 
yagnOpaveeta without taking the formal saNyAsa by thinking wearing 
yagnOpaveeta and doing related karma-s are something 'extra stupid' & it 
is a hindrance to his adhyAtmika sAdhana in advaita vedAnta ?? I know I am 
missing something here, a line of clarification would be highly 
appreciated. 

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
