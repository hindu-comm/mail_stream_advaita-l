You may have a vast collection of books but I am sorry to say you have not 
read them very carefully.  Nor do you seem to grasp exactly what is the 
issue in the crticisms that have been made.  (And to be fair there was 
confusion on the other side too.  This is not about "mlecchas".)

But thats not what Ravi said.  He said you have no adhikara for upanayana 
and sandhyavandana.  That's a different question from "entering the Hindu 
fold."  The vast majority in the "Hindu fold" do not have adhikara either. 
There is a vast literature in dharmashastras about adhikara.

This is where a study of history becomes fruitful.

Heliodorus the Bactrian-Greek ambassador to the Sungas circa 1st century 
BC established a Garudastambha at Vidisha in which he describes himself as 
"Heliodorus the Bhagavata."  So even in ancient times "conversion" was not 
unknown.  However note that the "fold" he was joining was the tantric 
pancharatra religion, the forerunner of Shrivaishnavism not "Hindu" or 
"Brahmana".

Perhaps of more relevance is Dara Shikoh the son of the 17th century 
Mughal emperor Shah Jehan under whose direction the first translation of 
the Upanishads (into Urdu) was made.  He did this because although he 
considered himself a Muslim, he believed that the "Hidden books of 
knowledge" mentioned in the Koran referred to Vedanta.  His inheritance 
was usurped by his brother the fanatical Aurangzeb who considered him (as did 
most mainstream Muslim elite opinion") an apostate.  Which "fold" does he 
belong to?

During the days of the East India company Major-General Charles "Hindoo" 
Stuart was notorious for having "gone native."  He dressed in dhoti with 
urdhvapundra tilaka with his personal team of pujaris regularly worshipped 
the full pantheon of Hindu devatas (He was buried as a Protestant but 
along with his murtis.)

Its the conceit of every generation that they have discovered something 
new but hrough the ages we see that various groups and individuals have 
entered what is being termed "the Hindu fold."  That's not an issue. 
What is relevant to the discussion at hand is nowhere do we see them 
taking up the specific dharma of a Brahmana.  This is unprecedented and 
requires strict scrutiny.

I understand this and it is the larger question that interests me more but 
there is a personal element too.  You have been a long time member of this 
list and many of the regular readers know you and look favorably upon 
you.  Normally one behaves gently with a friend but if that friend was, 
say, about to be hit by a bus, you would be justified in shoving him out 
of the way wouldn't you?  What you are doing is wrong.  Never mind any 
injury to Hinduism, it is injurious to your self.

Yes this is a very good question and one which is not being looked at 
critically by Hindus.

The basic problem as I see it is that "modern" Hinduism is not very modern 
at all.  Indians may be superficially modern in the usage of technology, 
computers etc.  but philosophically, conceptually, they are not.  And the 
paradigms they have for modernity, Christianity and to a lesser extent 
Marxism are ill-suited for integration into traditional conceptual models. 
They are in a similiar situation to the Jews in Europe.

Like Hindu jatis, Jews traditionally think of themselves as both a 
religion and an ethnicity.  Not eating pork etc. makes you Jewish but so 
does having a Jewish mother.  You can be "converted" to the Jewish faith 
but you are also "adopted" into the Jewish tribe.  Because of opression 
but also by their own choice Jews lived their lives apart from their 
Christian neighbors and those who violated the social norms by marrying 
outside or religious norms by working on the sabbath were equally shunned 
and expelled from the fold.  Then the Enlightement came and Jews became 
slowly but surely integrated as citizens of the nascent nation-states with 
secular law overriding the authority of the traditional power structure. 
The self-consciously Orthodox Jews continued the old dual conception as 
best as they could but now for the first time there were new conceptions 
focusing exclusively on nationality indifferent or even hostile to 
religion (Zionism especially the older socialist kind.) or as just another 
denomination of Englishman, Germans etc. (the Liberal/Reform position.)

Hinduism is facing that same bifurcation between ideology and ethnicity. 
Both sides appeal to "tradition" however to my mind they are equally 
inauthentic.  A truly "traditional" person takes both into account.

What is tradition anyway?  I maintain that there is no fixed point but a 
trajectory.  "Traditional" people look to the past to guide their actions 
in the present and aim to maintain continuity with the past into the 
future.  It's not just a question of whether a person is wearing kesari or 
not.  Do their actions further the continuity of Vedic dharma?  It's 
hard to predict the future.  But a rational man can have some idea 
by reviewing similar responses and their consequences.  Take the Jewish 
experience for instance.  While the early deviants were not very different 
in their behavior and outlook from the "orthodox" we can after 200 years 
see who has diverged from tradition and how.  Many of the "modern" Hindu 
perspectives also have had several generations to show results.

In my experience they are often lacking to the point of incoherence.  But 
as I said, the problem is equally that they are attempts to react to 
modernity but lack real understanding of it.

Again you betray confusion in confusion of dharmic categories. 
Mantropadesha, upanayana, and sannyasa are three separate things with 
different adhikara.

Because there are several different entry points and levels of 
participation in the "Hindu fold" as I mention in one of my other posts 
today.  The poster you were responding to said there is no conversion into 
a specific varna.  This is absolutely correct.  In fact there are many 
Indian ethnic groups of ambiguous varna most likely due to the way they 
entered the "Hindu fold."

I can't fault you for using the "My guru says" argument because many 
Hindus do but It's ironic that the other big topic being discussed on the 
list is apaurusheyatva because this is exactly what the Mimamsakas were 
trying to avoid.  The problem is you are replacing rule of law with cult 
of personality.  Maybe on an individual level it might not matter but on 
the societal scale it does.  On any global survey of corruption, Sweden 
comes out as one of the least and India as one of the most corrupt 
countries.  Why?  Its not because there are no villains in Sweden or no 
noble people in India.  But I submit to the difference is that the average 
Swede though he is most likely to be an apathetic Lutheran or outright 
atheist has nonetheless inherited from Christianity a respect for the rule 
of law.  Hinduism has provided the same but in recent times a mentality 
has arisen which tolerates flouting of the rules by a "big man" whether 
politician, film star or even Swami.  This does not bode well for our 
culture in the long run.   These gurus making exceptions may have their 
hearts in the right place but may also end up destroying that which they 
are trying to protect.

As the upholder and teacher of shastras not the maker of exceptions.

In the end it comes down to faith.  But that shouldn't stop you from 
asking questions.  Have you asked your guru why he thinks you should have 
upanayana.  I personally don't think he will come up with a plausible 
answer but I am willing and interested to know what it is.  In the mean 
time please remove the yajnopavit and dispose of it in a respectful 
manner, stop sandhya and continue with a more appropriate form of sadhana.

The paramount Vedantic sadhana requires no external implements at all. It 
is to ask the question "Who am I?" and to adjust ones actions accordingly. 
It is not just you, I ask myself this and review my own actions in the 
light of the answers.  We all should.
