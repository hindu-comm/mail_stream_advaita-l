Sri Venkataramani,

I am not sure about horoscope catching of sookshma sarira etc.I would not
want to comment on something which i do not know.
My grandfather was one of the well respected astrologers of India and I
have not heard anything of this sort,so would not want to
comment.
Just stick to the word varna as that is the word used by Lord krishna in BG
also.
Finally,let us worry for adhikaris not following the niyama,for an
anadhikari,Ishwara will guide in due course!!
