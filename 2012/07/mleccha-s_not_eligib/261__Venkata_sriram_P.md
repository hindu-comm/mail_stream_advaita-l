Namaste,

//

I think, instead of taking the literal meaning, we should see the broader 
picture from the vedAntik perspective

//

Just as the entire blueprint of banyan tree is in banyan seed, similarly, the 
blueprint of entire creation is in seed form. 

So, what all the ramifications arethere potentially inside the banyan seed, 
can be also be found with fully grown banyan tree also. 
Similarly, when the creation happens, all the 4 varNAs 
spring up at once and these 4 varNAs are there potentially in 
avyakta avastha. 

This is true from vedantic perspective and i concur with Sri Subbuji's explanation.

regs,
sriram
