Pranams,

The pitr karya is done by the sons of the deceased father. To my
knowledge the deceased one is supposed to come in the form of crows
and receive the offerings. But what if the deceased one has already
taken another birth and what if one has achieved moksha(I speak with
respect to liberation in the advaita sense). What happens in such
cases?

Regards,

Abhishek Madhyastha
