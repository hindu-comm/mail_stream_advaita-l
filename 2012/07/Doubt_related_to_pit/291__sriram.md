DearSri Abhishek Madhyastha
It is possible that some pithrus attain moksha but as we donot know the 
exact position.To err on the safeside we offer the annam of pinda pradhanam 
after srardha ceremony is over to crows as it is believed pithru devathas 
come in the form of crows.And pithru lokam is an abode of pithrudevatha 
which is never empty.The srardha ceremony is a must whether are not a 
particular soul had attained mukthi.R.Krishnamoorthy.
