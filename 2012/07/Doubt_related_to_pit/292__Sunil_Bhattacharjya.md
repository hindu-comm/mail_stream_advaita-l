Pranams,

What I understand is that if one has taken birth and his children of the past life performs shraddha then he gets some sort of pleasure, though that cannot be defined or attributed to any event of his present life. It is all in the belief. If he has attained higher lokas there also he gets pleasure.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Subject: [Advaita-l] Doubt related to pitr karya

Pranams,

The pitr karya is done by the sons of the deceased father. To my
knowledge the deceased one is supposed to come in the form of crows
and receive the offerings. But what if the deceased one has already
taken another birth and what if one has achieved moksha(I speak with
respect to liberation in the advaita sense). What happens in such
cases?

Regards,

Abhishek Madhyastha
