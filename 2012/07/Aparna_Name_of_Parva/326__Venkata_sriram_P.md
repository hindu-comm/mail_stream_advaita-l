Namaste,

//

But the implication of the departure is that it was part of her before

//

It was the definition given by Shri Bhaskararaya Makhin. So, i can't think of changing
the definition. 

IMHO that definition is for the sake of bhAvana only as it denotes Her ability to remove those debts of Her upAsakAs asShe out of Her own tapas got Herself freed of those. 

This can also be understood from advaitic angle. pArvati is prakruti lakSaNa 
that represents the Jiva. After performing the tapas, She married Siva who represents
swa-swarupa jnAna.Wedding with Siva implies union with Supreme Soul. Thus,
having attained Siva became *apa-rNa*.

regs,
sriram
