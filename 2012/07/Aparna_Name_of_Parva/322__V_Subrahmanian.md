Sunil ji,

The idea behind saying 'she did not eat even leaves' is that during tapsya,
as shown in the Dhruva episode in the Bhagavatam, one starts with eating
solid food like fruits from trees and gradually gives up that and eats only
leaves and goes on to sustain just on dried leaves fallen from trees and
then give up even that and so on.  In this context the word 'aparNA' has
been interpreted to mean that she was so devoted to the tapasyA that she
had surpassed the stage of even eating leaves.  It is not a reference to
eating off leaf as is done while food is served on plantain leaf or any
other suitable one.
