Dear Sri V.Subramanian
In Lalitha Sahasranamam the 754th namavali is Aparnayai nama:Apart from the 
meanings that She made tapasya without eating even a dried  leaf-parna is 
dried leaf-as in parna sala for a hut like dwelling,and She does not owe any 
debt as you had said,Sri Paramacharyal had  commented in His own 
beautifulway:Shiva is called Sthanu.That is He is still,unshakable and 
almost like a stump of a tree.Vruksha iva Sthabdha:says Maha Narayana 
Upanishad.Parvathi is like a leaf less -Aparna-creeper around Him.This I 
found in Sri  Lalitha Sahasranama Bhashyam.R.Krishnamoorthy.
