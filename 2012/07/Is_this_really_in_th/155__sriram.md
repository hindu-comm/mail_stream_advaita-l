Dear
Just a reference about Panchakshari Manthra.While reading Sri Lalitha 
Sahasranamam in explaining the namavali 472 Siddha Vidhya  it is said that 
Panchadasi manthra is called SiddhaVidhya and this Panchadasakshari and 
Panchakshari do not require any pre examination of the suitability of the 
person receiving the Japa Initiation.That means  the two manthras can 
universally  be recited by one and all.R.Krishnamoorthy.
