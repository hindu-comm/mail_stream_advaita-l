Fantastic discourse by Jagadguru Sringeri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji on dharma, karmaetc
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ywDTCIN0eY&feature=player_embedded
 
One of the finest speeches in the recent times. Very powerful message yet a simple delivery....he brings out simple examples to underline the importance of Nithya karma, pujas, anushtanas etc....every Brahmin must watch this.....

Best Regards
Meera
