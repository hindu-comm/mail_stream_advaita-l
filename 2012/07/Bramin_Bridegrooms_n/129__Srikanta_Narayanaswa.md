Apart from the traditions being followed,the women are bbecoming more intelligent.The opportunities are more,and they also learn quickly.They are more devoted to their work and they have work culture,even at home.There is a metamorphosis in our culture.The future belongs to women.It ia urgent for the Bramins to modify the unnecessary details regarding the Bridegrooms.
