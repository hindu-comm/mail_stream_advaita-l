Dear Sri Srikanta, before the mimamsakas do you think vaidhikas thought Vedas were paureshya? If so, are there any literary evidences to support your view?

Subject: [Advaita-l] Apourusheyatva--Faith or Logic.

1.The mimamsakas are the first to say that Vedas are "Apourusheya".
Veda pramana:The Mimamsakas give the reason for recognising the Vedas as separate pramana is that the "Dharma is not a physical object(Bhaoutha vastu).It cannot be known by the senses(Indriyas),or reasons(anumana). therefore,for knowing the "Dharma"Vedas are the only means.Other "Pramanas"are not useful for knowing the "Dharma".In order to show this that other pramanas are not useful and for condemning the argguments of others who donot acceept the Vedas.
The "Shabdha"or sound are of two types.i.Pourusheya and 2.Apourusheya.
2.They come into existence by the human 'sanketha"or Signs.The vedas direct the 'laukika"which can be known by other pramanas.
3.Vedic words directs the "Aloukika dharmas"which cannot be known by other pramanas.The "Laukika'words change.They are not permanent(nitya)They donot change.If the words are to be true the person who utters it has to be "Pramanika"(honest).Therefore it is "sapeksha satya".The Vedas words are "Svatah pramanika"(self truthful).
4.Both Prabhakara Mishra and Kumarila Bhatta have given counter arguments for the objections against the "Apourusheya"vada:The words are created by the trials of Human beings.Therefor they are not permanent.The Vedas are not created by human beings.Nowhere it is said in Vedas that they are created by such and such a human being..It cannot also be said that it is created by the 'Parama Purusha'(The almighty).Because,it is not famous that God exists.Even for an argument we take that God exists,He cannot have created this world with so much sorrow.Then we have to say that the God is cruel.Being very powerful,he cannot have created this world with many defects(dosha).Since he is always satisfied and self-sufficient,woild he create this world?If the creation is under his control,inorder to be for his satisfaction he has to depend on the creation.He cannot remain independent(sarva tantra svatantra).It is not also proper to argue that God is necessary to
 distribute the "Karma Phalas'for the "Jivas".The "Karma"is born with the Karma phala in its stomach.The cause for the human beings to experience "Sukha'(happiness)and sorrow(dukha)is is the "Karmas"of the human beings.This process of the "Vishva kriya"(World process)is beginningless(anadi).There is no birth not death for it.Similarly the Vedic speech is also beginningless(anadi).It is without birth or death,it is "nitya"(Permanent).
5.The sentence of the Vedas are born when they are uttered.When it is stopped utterinhg they disappear(laya).For this argument the answer of the Mimamsakas is like this.In order to utter the Vedic sentence the sentence must be in existence.first.Therefore the utterance(uccharana)shows or indicates what is existing uttereance and doesnot create it.What is to be uttered must be in existence first.They exist before it is uttered.It also exists after it has been uttered.Therefore they are "nitya"(Permanent).Thereforethe utterance is incidentsl(Prasangika).The utterance is mere Physical sound(Bhauta shabhdha).But,the speech is not merely a physical sound.It is meaningful,its meaning is not physical.It is "alaoukika"(not of this world).
6.Since diffeent people say the same sentence in different places,since it can be said at the same time,it is not "anadi'(beginningless).It is not all pervading.The Mimamsakas answer like this:The Sun is being seen by different persons.Therefore,the Sun is "anadi'(beginningless).
N.Srikanta (To be continued).
