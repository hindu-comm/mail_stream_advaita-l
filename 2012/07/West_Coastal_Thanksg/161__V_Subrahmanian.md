Description: In this retreat, Swaminiji will unfold the essence of the
entire Bhagavad Gīta, where Lord Kṛṣṇa taught Arjuna how to be free from
the sense of doership even while being engaged in action. This is the
secret of freedom from saṁsāra, a life of becoming. The Gīta’s message that
one is the whole is the ultimate solution to the universal human struggle
for freedom from being a wanting person. Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa presents us with a
unique vision, and a way of life that is in keeping with the vision.

In this retreat, the participants will gain an insight into the message of
the Gīta along with practical strategies to live these teachings to the
fullest in their day to day lives. There will also be separate classes for
children between the ages of 5-15.
