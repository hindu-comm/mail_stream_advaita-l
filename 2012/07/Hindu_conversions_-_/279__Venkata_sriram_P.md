Gone through the link. 

AFAIK, vrAtyastOma is performed for *patita-sAvitrikAn* ie., when the brAhmaNAs down
the 3 generations have failed to perform sandhyAvandana and agnihOtra, the 3rd generation becomes a *patita-brAhmaNa* or *patita-sAvritikA*. So, if such a 
person wants to perform vaidika karmakANDa, he has to undergo this rite called
*vrAtyastOma*. 

This is what i understood from the pAraskara gruhya sUtra which mentions about this
stOma (trr-puruSan patita-sAvritrikAn apatyE saMskAra na adhyApanaM).

Corrections are welcome.

regs,
sriram
