Dear
Any Japa will be done after a sankalpa.Karishye comes part of sankalpa and 
there fore is in future tense.If the sankalpa is modified to include others 
on whose behalf the japa/pooja is going to be done karishyami will be 
appropriate.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Subject: [Advaita-l] SANSKRIT GRAMMAR AND SANDHYAVANDANA


Dear all,

In sandhyavandana we recite at various stages:

Prataha/sayam sandhyavandana nitya-karma karishye
Prataha/sayam sandhyavandana arghya pradhana karishye
Prataha/sayam sandhyavandana upasthaana karishye

1.Now karishye means I will do (for my self?) which is atmapedi form of the 
verb root Kru- to do; uttama purusha ekavachana bhavishya-kaal ("I" future 
tense).

2.Now sandhya-vandana is a nitya-karma that Dvijas have duty and adhikara to 
do. Kanchi Paramacharya in his book: Hindu Dharma states Dvijas do arghya to 
destroy the asuras of the mind for all
beings. {http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part17/chap13.htm:The 
twice-born (Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas) have the duty of discharging 
"Astras" every day to destroy asuras or the evil forces besieging mankind. 
Does not "Astra" mean that which is discharged, thrown or hurled? What is 
the "Astra" which is to be thrown or discharged [by the twice - born]? We 
throw water so as to drive away or destroy the demons or evil forces that 
have taken hold of the minds of people. This water, the astra, is the same 
as the libation offered during sandhiyavandana.}

3.Dvijas also recite Gayatri mantra to spiritually illuminate all beings. 
{http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part17/chap12.htm:Similarly when the 
three varnas practise gayatri-japa all other jatis enjoy the benefit flowing 
from it. We may cease to perform a rite if the fruits yielded by them are 
enjoyed exclusively by us. But we cannot do so if others also share in them. 
Those entitled to Gayatri mantra are to regard themselves as trustees who 
have to mutter it on behalf of others like women and the fourth varna who 
are not entitled to it. If they fail in their duty of trustees, it means 
they are committing an irremediable offence.}

4.Given what is mentioned above, why is Karishyami not used. Would not that 
be more appropriate as Karishyami is utama purusha ekavachana bhavishya-kaal 
parasmapedi form. Parasmapedi would imply doing on behalf or for others.

Dhanyavaad,
Ravi Chandrasekhara
