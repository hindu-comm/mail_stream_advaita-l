Namaste,

>1.Now karishye means I will do (for my self?) which is atmapedi form of the
> verb root Kru- to do; uttama purusha ekavachana bhavishya-kaal ("I" future
> tense).

HH Sri Sringeri Shankaracharya in a recent Anugraha Bhashana spoke
about why we are using Karishye and not Karishyami. When we use
Karishye we are in alignment with what is said in Sankalpa namely Mamo
Paatha Samasta  Durithakshayadvara ***Sri Parameshwara
Preethyartham***. We do Sandhyavandanam for Parameshwara's
satisfaction. The person who has undergone Upanayana Samskara do it as
a Nitya Karma.

Hari Om Tat Sat,
Sriram
