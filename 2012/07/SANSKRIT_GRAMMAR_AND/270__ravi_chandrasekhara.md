Dear all,

In sandhyavandana we recite at various stages:

Prataha/sayam sandhyavandana nitya-karma karishye
Prataha/sayam sandhyavandana arghya pradhana karishye
Prataha/sayam sandhyavandana upasthaana karishye

1.Now karishye means I will do (for my self?) which is atmapedi form of the verb root Kru- to do; uttama purusha ekavachana bhavishya-kaal ("I" future tense).

2.Now sandhya-vandana is a nitya-karma that Dvijas have duty and adhikara to do. Kanchi Paramacharya in his book: Hindu Dharma states Dvijas do arghya to destroy the asuras of the mind for all
beings. {http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part17/chap13.htm:The twice-born (Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas) have the duty of discharging "Astras" every day to destroy asuras or the evil forces besieging mankind. Does not "Astra" mean that which is discharged, thrown or hurled? What is the "Astra" which is to be thrown or discharged [by the twice - born]? We throw water so as to drive away or destroy the demons or evil forces that have taken hold of the minds of people. This water, the astra, is the same as the libation offered during sandhiyavandana.}

3.Dvijas also reciteGayatri mantrato spiritually illuminate all beings. {http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part17/chap12.htm:Similarly when the three varnas practise gayatri-japa all other jatis enjoy the benefit flowing from it. We may cease to perform a rite if the fruits yielded by them are enjoyed exclusively by us. But we cannot do so if others also share in them. Those entitled to Gayatri mantra are to regard themselves as trustees who have to mutter it on behalf of others like women and the fourth varna who are not entitled to it. If they fail in their duty of trustees, it means they are committing an irremediable offence.}

4.Given what is mentioned above, why is Karishyami not used. Would not that be more appropriate as Karishyami is utama purusha ekavachana bhavishya-kaal parasmapedi form. Parasmapedi would imply doing on behalf or for others.

Dhanyavaad,
Ravi Chandrasekhara
