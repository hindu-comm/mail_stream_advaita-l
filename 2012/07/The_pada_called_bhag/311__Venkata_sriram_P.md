Pujya sadAji,

A small correction:

///

Shankarāchārya is called Bhagavadpādaha and not Bhagavadshiraha.

//

Here, the word pAda doesn't imply the feet. Scholars are addressed with respect 
in those days as bhagavAn / pAda etc. Shri Abhinava Gupta of Kashmir was
respectfully addressed as *abhinava gupta pAda*. Similarly, mimAmsakAs
were respectfully addressed as *bhATTa pAda*. 

On the similar lines, Sankara was addressed with respect and adored sometimes
as *bhagavAn* and sometimes addressed as *pAda*.

So, bhagavan+pAda became *bhagavatpAda*. It is a mark of respect shown to scholars.

Nothing associated with feet of puruSa.

regs,
sriram
