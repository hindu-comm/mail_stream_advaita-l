Namaste,

In the thread by Kuntimaddi Sadanandji, 4 classifications based on
jati, i.e janma are given, namely Jati Brahmana, Jati Kshatriya, Jati
Vaishya and Jati Shudra. My doubt is, how do shaivas fit into this
system? Shaivism has existed for quite a long time and certainly they
must have a role in this system? The shaivas started by Basavanna
although recent, is an example for such shaiva communities.
