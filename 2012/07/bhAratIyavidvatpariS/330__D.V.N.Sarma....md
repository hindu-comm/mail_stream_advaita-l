Thank you very much for giving all of us the location of a copy of this
book.

The author is the son of a telugu poet Venkata Kavi and belongs the
sampradaya of Sridhara venkatesa
and also a vainika. He challenged the scholars of his time to disprove his
thesis in which case he offered
to become the disciple of that scholar.

regards,
Sarma.
