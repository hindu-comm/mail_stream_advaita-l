I have been requesting this rule for a while now. But usually I get
some "x y z self-moderation a b c" speech from Jaldhar or no response
at all.

The list has ground to a halt essentially because of 2 things

1. People feeling obliged to crank out either the most stupid
questions or starting a topic without even some basic reasearch into
the topic. Yes Virginia, there ARE stupid questions, and just because
you are connected to the internet 24/7 doesn't mean you need to
bombard the list with drivel.
2. About 3-4 people who feel obliged to participate in every thread
with pages and pages of stuff.

You can see from the list archives who these culprits are.

Once in a while things get out of hand and someone like Vidyasankar
tries to step in - but the atmosphere is so bad we have mini-Hitlers
using this list to vent their hatred of people, denounce entire
regions of the world and indulging their superiority complex. We saw
this in a recent thread.

In the INDOLOGY list, one member was posting about 10-20 posts
everyday and the list was grinding to a halt. SO they implemented this
2 per day per member rule and boy did things get better.
