Dear List Members,

While the moderators are usually very lenient in enforcing posting guidelines, 
as a list member I wish to ask that the 'no more than 2 posts' rule be followed 
- at least on this thread. At a minimum, it helps one to understand and reflect
 upon what is written .

Thanks,
Murali Manohar
