Namaste,

Unless this thread is closed I have a request to the learned members of the list to be kind to give their valuable opinion of the following verse from Shukla Yajura Veda, which has been quoted by Swami Dayananda, the founder of the Arya Samaja, to justfy that Vedas are for all. The Vedic verse is given below for your ready reference along with the tranlsation given by the Arya Samaja. I must clarify that I do not necessarily agree with Dayanandaji's views on this and quite some other points, though he was a learned man. Vedavyasa composed the Mahabharata and Bhagavata purana for the Shudras and those ladies, who could not get the required education to study these scriptures.

Yajur
veda (Shukla) 26.2


यथेमां
वाचं कल्याणी मावदानि जनेभ्यः //
ब्रह्म
राजन्याभ्यांच शुद्राय चार्याय
च स्वाय चारणाय // २६.२ //


That
I to all the people may address this salutary speech,
To priest
and nobleman, Sûdra and Arya, to one of our own
kin and to the
stranger.
Dear may I be to Gods and guerdon-giver. Fulfilled be
this
my hope: be that my portion!  


Regards,
Sunil KB

I have been requesting this rule for a while now. But usually I get
some "x y z self-moderation a b c" speech from Jaldhar or no response
at all.

The list has ground to a halt essentially because of 2 things

1. People feeling obliged to crank out either the most stupid
questions or starting a topic without even some basic reasearch into
the topic. Yes Virginia, there ARE stupid questions, and just because
you are connected to the internet 24/7 doesn't mean you need to
bombard the list with drivel.
2. About 3-4 people who feel obliged to participate in every thread
with pages and pages of stuff.

You can see from the list archives who these culprits are.

Once in a while things get out of hand and someone like Vidyasankar
tries to step in - but the atmosphere is so bad we have mini-Hitlers
using this list to vent their hatred of people, denounce entire
regions of the world and indulging their superiority complex. We saw
this in a recent thread.

In the INDOLOGY list, one member was posting about 10-20 posts
everyday and the list was grinding to a halt. SO they implemented this
2 per day per member rule and boy did things get better.
