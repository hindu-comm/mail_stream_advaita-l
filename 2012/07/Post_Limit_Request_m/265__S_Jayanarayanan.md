I second this.

I would actually prefer the stronger rule of "no more than two posts per day for a member" irrespective of the number of threads the member wishes to contributes to. If a member wants to send four posts toas manythreads, pleasedo so overthe course of two days (two posts per day)!

This helps to make for more meaningful discussions and reduce the noise level on the list.
