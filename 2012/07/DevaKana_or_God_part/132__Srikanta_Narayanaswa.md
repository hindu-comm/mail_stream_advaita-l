The same God particle was assumed in the Vaisheshika theory of Kanada.He said tow atoms form a "Dvaya anuka"and form the other objects.The Vaisheshikans beliived that the "Anus"created the world and they can be further divided.Kanada has given explanations of atoms form the objects and he held that the objects are formed by the atoms and different objects have difference only in the objects.Just like Diamond diferes from carbon in their 
crystal structure,so also objects differs from the number of atoms.Dignaga,the disciple of Vasubandu,criticised this Vaisheshika theory,and said that when the atoms are broken to smaller pieces,the pieces of atoms disappear.Therefore,it cannot be held that atoms are the smallest particles of objects.Being a Mahayanist and yogachara Vijnanavadi,Dignaga turned into an Idealist,who said"Yad antar Jneyarupam that Bahirvath avabhashate"(That which is the external form is seen "as it were"outside.For the Vijnanavadis,the world exists
inside,in the mind,and objects are visible due to "Vasana Vaichitrya".SriShankara criticises in his BrahmaSutra Bhashya.SriShankara also has given an elaborate argument as to how,"Dvayanukas"donot join together.(This is at the end of the "Bhagavad Gita"(Bhagavad Gita translated in English by Alladi Mahadeva Sastri)The atoms are also not "Nitya"(permanent).The "Athma"is the permanent entity and it is present every where,regardless of the bodies.
