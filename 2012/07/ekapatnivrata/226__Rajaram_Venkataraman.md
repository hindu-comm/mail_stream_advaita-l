RV: As you know more than I do, we can't translate randomly. We have to see
what commentators such as Sridhara said. The three adjectives are used by
the dhobhi with respect to his wife. Of these, paraveshagam only means
going to another's house. It does not mean consorting literally or by
derivation because that is already indicated by asatIm (unchaste). The
dhobhi only compares his wife going to another's house with that of Sita's
abduction by Ravana. He does not express any suspicion about Sita's
character by this comparison. There I see a fine line of difference. It is
like kapyasam pundarikam highlights the similarity in the colour of Lord's
eyes and the monkey's back but does not give an inferior simile.
