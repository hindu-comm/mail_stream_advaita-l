I don't have a copy of Ramayana handy at the moment but here is 
what the dhobhi said to his wife in Bhagavata 9.11.9 (and note he is 
directly comparing their relationship to Sita-Rama.)

nAhaM bibharmi tvAM duSTAM asatIM paraveshmagAm |

If you want to translate paraveshagAm as something other than "consorting" 
thats fine.  The point was about monogamy or the lack of it.
