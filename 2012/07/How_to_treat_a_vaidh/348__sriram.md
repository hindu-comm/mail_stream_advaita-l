Dears
During the Sri Rudra Ekadasani which is held during Shashtiabdha 
poorthi/Sadhbhishekam functions also I had seen that some of the purohitas 
do not chant fully and even talk or attend to mobile phones etc.They are all 
young /middleaged.When I point out to switch off the phones they say these 
calls are important for further opportunities etc.They may be right as far 
as their earnings are concerned but are they not doing injustice to the 
present householder? We should not disrespect the vaidikas but should we not 
tell them to be attentive to the Japa on hand?We should not on any account 
ill treat them but how to correct the black sheep?R.Krishnamoorthy.
