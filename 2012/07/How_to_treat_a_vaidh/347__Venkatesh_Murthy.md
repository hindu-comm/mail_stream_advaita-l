Namaste,

Nice story but there are some Purohitas not doing the Pujas and other
karmas properly. They are not saying Mantras properly. They are saying
Mantras very fast and skipping Mantras. I have personally witnessed
it. Should we show them also the same respect like we show a
Ghanapathi? It may not be correct. It is not correct to mistreat them
also.
