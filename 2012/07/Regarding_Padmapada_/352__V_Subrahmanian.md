It is generally held that Sri Padmapada was the first Shankaracharya of the
Puri Govardhana MaTha.  I wish to know if there is any 'pramANa' in the
form of references from any work like the mAdhavIya shankara vijayam?  Or
are there any edicts that refer to this information?  I am seeking this
information on behalf of a friend.
