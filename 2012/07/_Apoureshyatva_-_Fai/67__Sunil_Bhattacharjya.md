Namaste Sri Sunil

You did not undertsand my words.

I never said vomitting is literally done. A knower of Veda when he is
practicing the mantras is Adhyayana. When he is teaching it is
Adhyapana. But Yajnavalkya was not doing Adhyayana when Vaishampayana
asked for it. He was not doing Adhyapana also because he cannot teach
Guru the same thing he learned from him. He was giving back the Veda.
They say he vomitted it. The parrot disciples collected it. The whole
Veda is all the mantras got mixed. In Krishna Yajur the mantras are
very mixed with other things like Brahmanas. Aruna Prashna mantras are
in Aranyaka. This mixture is like the Vomitting food. When you eat
Jilebi, Gulab Jamun, Idli, Masala Dosa and vomit it comes out like a
mixture. I hope you are now understanding my words. I am not saying
literally vomitting. It means it is a mixture of many things.

Later on Lord Surya revealed the Shukla Yajurvaeda to Yajnavalkya. Further Lord Surya advised Yajnavalkya to pray to Mother Goddess Saraswati and that way Yajnavalkya could get back the lost knowledge of Krishna Yajurveda. Later on Vaishampayana requested Yajnavalkya to teach the Shukla Yajurveda to his (Vaishampayana's) disciples.

It is clear that you did not understand what the phrase "vomitted out" was used for, in this particular context.

>> Dear Sri Sunil, vomitted out? It is highly inappropriate usage. Anyway, the arguments in favour of entire Vedas bein available for humanity have been stated clearly. They are sabda and dharma are eternal. The counters have been answered. They are rishis and places are only specific instances of what is already in shruti, apparent evolution of language and life ignore sabda pramana and are based on incorrect anumana at best. Each one of your post was responded to by those of

>>
>> Dear Sri Bhaskar, any word which is in the shruti it points to eternal sabda. If a word is modified in vyavahara, it is does not. Please note that for sabara sabda does not always mean word (rf. H & L in Sabara Bhashya).

>> I understand you find it funny real yajnavalkya should know about shruti yajnavalkya. But that is the inevitable implication of entire Vedas being revealed to Lord Brahma, setting up of pravrtti and nivrtti margas at creation, oral tradition etc. Rama is described in Rig Veda. It is but natural people in Ramayana time knew Rama including Rama from RV. But the power of Maya can make them act the script normally. The smrti texts come up to describe that. Don't you find it funny that people do
