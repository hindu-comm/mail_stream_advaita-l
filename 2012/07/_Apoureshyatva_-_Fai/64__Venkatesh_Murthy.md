Namaste

Yajnavalkya quarrelled with his Guru. Guru Vaishampayana asked him to
give back the learned Yajur Veda. He vomitted Yajur Veda and other
disciples became parrots and collected it. The vomitting story is
correct. You can read it -

> Dear Sri Sunil, vomitted out? It is highly inappropriate usage. Anyway, the arguments in favour of entire Vedas bein available for humanity have been stated clearly. They are sabda and dharma are eternal.  The counters have been answered. They are rishis and places are only specific instances of what is already in shruti, apparent evolution of language and life ignore sabda pramana and are based on incorrect anumana at best. Each one of your post was responded to by those of us who boldly stuck to what we believe is the vaidhika view. If you think your position was not understood, please re-state it and re-present your supporting arguments. I will definitely agree if your view is established but I expect the same openness from you.

Secondly read the first five verses of the Purusha sukta and you may understand where Brahma stands and where the rishis like Yajnavalkya and others like you and me stand in the process of creation. Thirdly have you also read my earlier

> I understand you find it funny real yajnavalkya should know about shruti  yajnavalkya. But that is the inevitable implication of entire Vedas being revealed to Lord Brahma, setting up of pravrtti and nivrtti margas at creation, oral tradition etc. Rama is described in Rig Veda. It is but natural people in Ramayana time knew Rama including Rama from RV. But the power of Maya can make them act the script normally. The smrti texts come up to describe that.  Don't you find it funny that people do sandhyavandanam but can't chant gayatri because it was not revealed? How will brahmanas have children
