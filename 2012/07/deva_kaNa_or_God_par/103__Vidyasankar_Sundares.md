Bhaskar, please do not attempt to glean any deep meaning from TV reports
and news articles about this.

Higgs Boson is the proper name for the particle that scientists think they may
have some evidence for now. It was predicted in the 1960s by a physicist
named Peter Higgs. As with all such particles, the experiments to find some
empirical evidence of the particle were complicated and it proved elusive.
Basically, it is the particle that accounts for why physical objects have mass.

Much later, another physicist called Leon Lederman wrote a book meant for
popular comsumption, in which he gave the term "God particle" to the Higgs
boson. If scientific folklore is right, apparently, he wanted to name it the
g--d--- particle (you can fill in the blanks!), but the editors wouldn't let him
do that. :-)

So, some scientist's expression of frustration with finding a particle prediced
by the statistics used in modern physics and his editor's modification of what
the scientist actually wanted to say gave birth to the name God particel. Today,
it has stuck and taken a life of its own. It means (or should mean) nothing
for anybody who is serious about science and/or philosophy.
