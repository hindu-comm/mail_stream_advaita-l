At the outset I am no way qualified to raise any question on science 
related matters as I am below average student in this subject even in my 
high school days.  Since yesterday there is a huge applause and cheers 
from scientists that they have 'discovered' the magic particle called 
'deva kaNa' or God particle which is the main cause behind big-bang and 
something like that.  I have read today's news paper, watched TV shows 
with regard to this but those explanations are just going over my head. 
Hence, I request scientists of this list to explain me the importance of 
this latest discovery and its role in creation of universe in lay man 
language.    Is this something that proves the evolution theory with more 
accuracy ??  Is this scientific discovery goes anyway against vedic 
siddhAnta??  I once again, request to explain this in a simple language 
without using the professional scientific terminologies. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
