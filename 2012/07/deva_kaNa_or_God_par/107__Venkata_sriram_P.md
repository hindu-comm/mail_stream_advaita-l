//

What we call Brahman is the God particle

//

Tomorrow, some tom, dick & harry would discover another particle which would seem
even subtler than this particle. Who knows? Another scientist would be ready with
his finding which would be just contrary to this finding. 

Brahman is *aNOraNIyAn mahatOmahIyAn*. 

But i am happy that somebody is putting his brains and doing a 
serious study on thisand is arrivingtowards nAda brahma, 
the primordial sound.

This is also a form of upAsana.

regs,
sriram
