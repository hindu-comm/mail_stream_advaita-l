Namaste

The above work is authored by Sri AyyaNNa DikShita who lived over 250 years
ago and is about determining the tAtparya, purport, of the bAdarAyaNa
sUtras.  It is a short work of some 90 pages in demy size.

I am having a 1910 Sanskrit edition (Sri Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam).  I
wish to know if the English translation (mentioned in the above link) is
available for viewing, downloading or purchase.

Also has any other author/Acharya of non-Advaitic schools referred to this
work?
