Namaste,

In srImadbhAgavata, the episode of Indra slaying pAkAsura has been
mentioned. This comes in 11th Chapter of 8th skandha. 

At the time of churning of kSIra sAgara, Indra slays 4 demons namely
Jambhasura, Namuchi, Bala & Paka. Here is the reference in 19th sloka:

////

jambham srutva hatam tasyajnatayo naradad rseh
namucis ca balah pakastatrapetus tvaranvitah......19th sloka

//

As regards the reference to mantrashAstra, it has been quoted very 
vaguely and i am unable to trace out. 

regs,
sriram
