There is a mantra in the Mundakopanishad which states:
"Dau Suparna sayuja shakhayah samana vrukshe sam parishakvaksvajate!
tayor anyah pippalam svadatti anashnam anyo abhishakasheeti!!"

The word,"Suparna" means golden leaf,or bird which is referred to two birds perchd on top of the same tree,one is the Brahman and the other is the ego(jivatma),the jivatma is eating Karmic fruits which are bitter,and the other simply is watching the first one.

The word "Aparna" has many meanings,"not a leaf","pure".If we go by the first meaning,"not a leaf",it means ,"a fruit"Parashakthi,also means,"Amra",mango fruit,which is not a leaf,but a fruit.
N.Srikanta.
