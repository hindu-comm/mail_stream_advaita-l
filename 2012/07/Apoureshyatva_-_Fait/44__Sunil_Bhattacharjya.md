Namaste,

I think, many a times even the learned persons overdo their criticism just because they think that they can criticise any aspects while ignoring the other aspects in the development of the philosophical ideas as related to passage of time. A sound judgement is necessary in such cases. Some say that common sense is another name for sound judgement. The Indian philosophy is the science of the soul and like the natural physical evolution the mankind also experiences the evolution of the nature (of the mankind). The evolved nature needs an evolved body in an evolved society and that is how one takes rebirth in a changed environmentand not in the environment, where the earlier birth took place. They forget that even in the avataras of Lord Vishnu, as given in the fith veda, there is a sort of evolution. In keeping with the evolution the dharmashastras also have changes in their rules for different times (Yugas). While the Manu Smriti was the Smriti for the
 Satya yuga the main Smriti for the Treta yuga was the Gautama Smriti. Of course the smritis like Yajnavalkya were there to supplement in the areas not covered by the main Smriti. So also there are different Smrits for the Dwapara yuga and the Kali yuga. Thus it is not at all proper to criticise why a certain custom was not followed in the Satya yuga if that particular custom came into vogue in one of the later yugas. The different revelations came at different times in keeping with the evolution.

Regards,
Sunil KB

praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

For, if we say portions of the Veda became known to mankind in 
installments
or at various periods of time, the anupapatti of all karma-s/vidhis
nishedhas remaining unknown to man till they became known in driblets 
would
arise. This 'unfairness' was one of the things the Acharya highlighted in
the first quoted reply.

> For that matter, whether veda-s revealed in piece-meal manner or all 
veda-s dumped at once, hardly matters considering the unawareness of 
veda-s & its validity among Hindu-s even today!! So, the process, 
revealing or un-revealing portion of the veda-s is not responsible for the 
accruing pApa or puNya. Ignorance of fire power does not stop anyone from 
burning his finger..Vedic injunctions and prohibitions and resultant 
phala-s also would be like that only. 


What exactly did the Rshis do? What was their role? My guess is that
their role was in propagating the Veda, mainly for adhyayanam purposes.

> We can not say this strictly, coz. veda-s as a whole is a store house 
of every minute details of even social life,system and practice, that 
includes hitting the wife if she does not agree with the husband's demands 
:-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
