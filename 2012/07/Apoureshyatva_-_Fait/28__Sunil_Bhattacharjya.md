As I stated in my last mail on this, while showing a hymn from the Rig Veda, the hymn clearly states that the rishis had thought (ie. had their enquiries) and they received the answers in their mind, which the hymns represent. Thus the Veda is a philosophy and the six systems of Indian philosophy just originated from the enquiries at different levels and the corresponding outcomes.


Sincerely,
Sunil KB

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Apoureshyatva - Faith or Logic?

According to their logic, the mantras are eternal and passed down through 
oral tradition.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

But as I mentioned veda-s as a whole not mere maNtra-s, it has brAhmaNa 
portion as well, which is the description of rituals and formalities to be 
followed in those rituals like rAjasUya, agnishtOma, sOma yAga etc. And 
these details of vidhi-nishedha etc. are not maNtra-s perse. But having 
the details of the materials (pAtra sAdhana etc.) for which there is a 
particular time frame for designing (for example nail cutters) !!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
