If Brahma was revealed entire Vedas, won't he know about Yajnavalkya?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Kindly dont think otherwise.  I am not talking about brahman's knowledge 
about yAgnAvalkya..Just I was wondering about real life character 
yagnAvalkya's knowledge about upanishadic character yagnAvalkya and real 
life character yagnAvalkya-s acting or real life incidences which 
perfectly matching with upanishad yAgnAvalkya's story.  If the br.up. 
exists before real life yagnAvalkya, definitely he would have read the 
role of yAgnAvalkya in up...and not only yAgnAvalkya many other 
characters,( including janaka) also that we find in up. and real life 
janaka would have known which are all  the quesitons upanishad janaka 
posed to upanishad yAgnAvalkya and in turn the answers given by him.. is 
it not??  BTW, my question is whether these character repetition and story 
repetition restricted to ONLY upanishadic stories or character's like 
bhaskar, rAjAram prabhuji etc. also??  Who knows??  there might a mention 
in lost large portion of veda about debate on aparusheya vAda in cyber 
world among vaidiks!!??  These things looks funny to me, kindly pardon me 
prabhuji if my thinking is nonsense.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
