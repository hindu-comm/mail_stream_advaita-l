We should not confuse that with grhya and srauta sutras

praNAms
Hare Krishna

No, I am not getting confused...I am talking about the nail cutters, pot, 
ornaments, wheel etc. that we can find in even brahma vidyA pradhAna 
shruti texts.  And brAhmaNa portions which talk comprehensively on the 
vidhi-nishedha and vidhAna of shrauta karma-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
