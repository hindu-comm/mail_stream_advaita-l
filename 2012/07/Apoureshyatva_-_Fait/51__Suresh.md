********Of course, all this also presumes the existence of time. Evolutionary theory
has nothing to say about the nature of time itself. For that a scientist has
to turn to cosmology, as Sri Anand Hudli aptly pointed out in another post
today, and the vedAntic approach (and the scientific approach too) to that
problem is independent of the presence or otherwise of the species that 
is today called Homo sapiens.********

Could you please tell me how time is relevant here? Dont fossil record prove the theory right?
