Namaste,

//

I am talking about the nail cutters, pot, ornaments, wheel etc. that we can find in even brahma vidyA pradhAna shruti texts. And brAhmaNa portions which talk comprehensively on the vidhi-nishedha and vidhAna of shrauta karma-s

//

The cardinal principle behind the apaurshEyatva is sabdanityatva vAda. So, even if there is *anitya prasanga* in mantra bhAga, going by the sUtra pramANa*uktaM tu sabdapUrvatvaM*, this aprastuta sabda prayOga is nitya which existed even before it's
manifestation. And hence, considered as *apaurshEya*. 

Whatever names are mentioned in veda, going by the sUtra pramANa *AkhyA pravachanAt*, they are apaurshEya only. 

Even the mention of vidhi & nishEdha in mantra bhAga that point towards karma kANDa 
is also apaurshEya based on the sUtra *chOdanalakSanArthO dharmaH*.

So, vEda in it's entirety is apaurshEya only based on sabdanityatva vAda.

regs,
sriram
