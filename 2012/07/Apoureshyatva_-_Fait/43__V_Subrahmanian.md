What is meant in the Acharya's reply is like this: When there are no rules
at all laid down, the Authority cannot punish someone for violation or
reward someone for adhering. If they are laid down, then ignorance of law
cannot be an excuse, for it is expected that people coming under the
jurisdiction of those rules are supposed to be aware of them.  In the well
known upanayana context: prAgupanayanAt kAmAchaaraH kAmvaadaH
kAmabhakShaH.  After upanayana all this is supposed to stop.  If no codes
are there at all to tell us what constitutes kAmAchAraH, etc. no one can be
held guilty of violating this after upanayana.
