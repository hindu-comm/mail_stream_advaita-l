The mantra bhAga which is in the form of udAtta, anudAtta & svarita are 
reveletions.  That is they are heard AS IT IS and they EXIST in the form 
of sabda tarangAs.  The rishi through his tapas attains the same frequency 
levels and *listens* to those sabda tarangAs that are in the form of 
subtle vibrations.  Having performed the dhAraNa of those vibrations, 
transmits the same to his disciple.

And with this we have to assume that yajurveda maNtra-s have been revealed 
to some set of rishi-s and likewise same mantra-s with different svara-s 
in rigveda, sAma veda etc. have been revealed to different set of rishi-s 
over a period of different times.  And to our misfortune, today these 
mantra-s too in prayOga etc. have under gone modifications and 
ritviks/vaidiks/purOhits chanting it differently.  For example, brahma 
jagnAnam prathamam purastAt maNtra cannot be found in rigveda but this 
mantra is chanted with rigvedeeya svara-s, like wise, gaurimimaaya 
salilAni takshatyekapadi etc. mantra which can be found in taitereeya 
AraNyaka prathama prashna is chanted in saMhitA mantra style without any 
vAkya vibhAga and sachitra chitraM mantra in rigveda which you can hardly 
find in yajurveda but comfortably chanted in yajurveda prayOga with 
different svara-s!!??  It is really regret to note that avichhinna shruti 
parampare, nowadays, undergoing modifications in the hands of ritviks & 
vaidiks of today.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
