Please check Jaimini 1.1. 25 onwards. I am Rajaram and transitory but the 
name is anadi. Someone in future may say that Rajaram lived in 21st 
century and he will be right in saying so. But if he said Rajaram did not 
exist before this time, he is wrong because the name is anadi.

Dont you think the same logic can be extended to even historical proper 
nouns ( and for that matter each and every noun) as well which you defined 
as 'proper nouns??  If yes, then why we should say ONLY names of rishi-s 
found in veda-s are common nouns and historical personalities are proper 
nouns?? Please explain.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

PS :  prabhu is the indwelling Atman of everyone (eko devaH 
sarvabhuteshu....) prabhu is the sarva nAma and Sri Rajaram venkataramani 
is proper nAma in him the 'prabhu' the sarva nAma:-))
