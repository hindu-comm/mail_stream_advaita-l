BTW, your theory of evolution of dharma leads to many
inconsistencies. Before Gayatri mantra is revealed, people didn't chant
that during sandhyavandanam? Even if you say so, before "ma himsyat sarva
bhutani" or "satyam vada" was revealed, did no one incur the sin due to
violence or lie? How do we know that someone will not give a new vidhi in
the future? Without being revealed full knowledge, how did sanatkumaras
follow nivrtti marga? If it is not through incorrect inference, how do we
know rishis lived at a point in time and the Vedas were non-existent 
before
he first rishi appeared? Brahma, by your logic, must have been quite
ignorant to start with.

It seems you have not understood what Sri Vidya prabhuji saying in his 
mail.  Hence, you are just imagining something on your own and refuting 
it..(erecting a strawman and beating it :-)) Here is what he said in his 
mail :

// quote //

To say that a Rshi lived in time and that he or she revealed some portion 
of the veda to mankind does not imply the prior non-existence of what was 
revealed. I've never implied anything of the sort, even remotely.
In fact, as a vedAntin, I don't accept prAg-abhAva.

// unquote //

Here he is clearly saying that he is not implying prior non-existence of 
what was revealed and to be precise he is clearly declaring that he is not 
accepting the prAg-abhAva!!  Despite this, you are assuming that he is of 
the opinion that prior non-existence of the unrevealed veda is possible 
and refuting that view !! 


Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
