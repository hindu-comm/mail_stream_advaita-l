Even before Yajnavalkya lived, vaidhikas knew about him completely from 
the shruti. 

praNAms
Hare Krishna

confusion!!  do you mean to say, yAjnAvalkya, maitreyi, gArgi, janaka etc. 
(characters in br.up.)   knew the bruhadAraNyaka upanishad & its story 
(janaka's  challenge, yAgnAvalkya saMvAda, his retirement to saNyAsa etc.) 
and simply acted exactly according to the script of that shruti??  And the 
vaidika-s who knew the shruti bruhadAraNyaka anticipated the future real 
life incidence of yAgnAvalkya ??  Something funny it sounds :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
