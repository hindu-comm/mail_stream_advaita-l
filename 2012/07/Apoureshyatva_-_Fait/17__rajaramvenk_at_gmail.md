For centuries, traditional scholars believed in creationism. In fact, they argue against vaiseshika theory, which says that the world comes from (god) particle :)

Intelligence is a brain function and it evolves as per science. According to the Vedas, it is an attribute of sukshuma sarira.

We can't readjust Vedas to suit modern theories. We don't have to reject modern science either. It is valid in pratyakshAnumana domain whereas Vedas are valid in sabda domain covering drsta and adrsta.

Thanks for that observation.  If the Evolutionists concede the above
perhaps it would not leave much of evolution in that theory:

//First human was not like us and they were more like Apes (Homo
Erectus, Neanderthal and transitional types between Neanderthal and
modern man) and by gradual evolutionary changes—modern humans have
been finally evolved.//

//Science does not believe in CREATION theory and Religion does not
believe in EVOLUTION theory. Truth is, if Religion wants to mix-up
with evolution then, we shall have to consider Adam# as Ape-like
Neanderthal or Homo-erectus early human having smaller brain, *and not
a perfect human having all the intelligential qualities*, as the Bible
or Quran described so eloquently for all believers!//

[# For 'Adam' and 'Eve' we can read the 'manu' and 'shatarUpaa' that
BrahmA created out of himself to propagate the human species. ]

//About 2-6 million years ago, early ape-like Humans were evolved from
mammals in Kenya, Africa. Early humans were spread to Europe, Asia
from African continent.//
