What is the confusion? If it sounds funny, please have a laugh. We allow hasya. If you want some thing funny, here is a story one famous sastrigal told me. 

Sita asks Rama in one of the ramayanas, "You are asking about staying back in Ayodhya. Have you ever heard of Rama leaving Sita behind in any Ramayana? What you say is sruti smrti virodha Rama" 

If Brahma was revealed entire Vedas, won't he know about Yajnavalkya?

Even before Yajnavalkya lived, vaidhikas knew about him completely from 
the shruti.

Hare Krishna

confusion!!  do you mean to say, yAjnAvalkya, maitreyi, gArgi, janaka etc. 
(characters in br.up.)   knew the bruhadAraNyaka upanishad & its story 
(janaka's  challenge, yAgnAvalkya saMvAda, his retirement to saNyAsa etc.) 
and simply acted exactly according to the script of that shruti??  And the 
vaidika-s who knew the shruti bruhadAraNyaka anticipated the future real 
life incidence of yAgnAvalkya ??  Something funny it sounds :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
