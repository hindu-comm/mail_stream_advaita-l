This was already addressed. Mimamsakas establish using  sabda is eternal and that loukika sabda is found in Vedas also (e.g. Go). All loukika words are indicative of eternal sabda or they are modifications thereof. If there are multiple modifications over time, you will have a situation that they look very different but if we go to etymological roots and cognates, we should come to the eternal sabda. The paureshya texts are valid as long as they rest on apaureshya shruti.

Based on the sabdanityatvavAda and apaurshEya lakSaNa of shruti, there 
could be
vitaNDa vAdana that words of Bible & Quran are also apaurshEya.

Hare krishna

If we dont restrict sabdanityatva to ONLY shruti-shabda then the question 
you posed is not out of vitanda vAda, it is a valid question/vAda needs to 
be addressed satisfactorily.  And shabda-s found in smruti or paurusheya 
texts too would be aparusheya only based on shabda nityatvavAda. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
