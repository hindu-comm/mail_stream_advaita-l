The names of rishis mentioned are common nouns. The historical persons are 
proper nouns and they get the name because of interpreting them.

Little bit elaboration is requested here.  I am not able to understand how 
'names' of rishi-s are 'sarva nAma'.  AFAIK, a common noun does not 
indicate any particular name, it is common without any specifics..cow is 
common noun but if we mention lakshmi cow at ramaNa Ashrama then it is not 
common noun it is proper noun.  Likewise, the word 'rishi' is common noun, 
but if we specifically mention, vishvAmitra rishi, agastya rishi, bhrugu 
rishi etc. it is not common it is proper nouns indicating some particular 
person.  Kindly let me know, how various  rishis' names can be justified 
as mere sarva nAma considering the vyAkaraNa niyama. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
