Based on the sabdanityatvavAda and apaurshEya lakSaNa of shruti, there 
could be
vitaNDa vAdana that words of Bible & Quran are also apaurshEya.

If we dont restrict sabdanityatva to ONLY shruti-shabda then the question 
you posed is not out of vitanda vAda, it is a valid question/vAda needs to 
be addressed satisfactorily.  And shabda-s found in smruti or paurusheya 
texts too would be aparusheya only based on shabda nityatvavAda. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
