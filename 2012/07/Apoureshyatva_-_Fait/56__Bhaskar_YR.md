The paureshya texts are valid as long as they rest on apaureshya shruti.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

For that matter both paurusheya & apaurusheya texts have the loukika words 
(like your example 'go') so, words found in both texts, though might have 
undergone multiple modifications, ultimately having the original shabda 
which is nitya as its base right?? So, there is no harm in calling even 
smruti's words as apaurusheya as long as it has its roots in nityatva of 
shabda-s. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
