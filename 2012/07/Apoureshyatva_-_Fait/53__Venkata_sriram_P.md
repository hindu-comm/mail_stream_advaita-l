Namaste Subbuji,

//

What exactly did the Rshis do? What was their role? My guess is that
their role was in propagating the Veda, mainly for adhyayanam purposes. I
know we are not getting the complete picture. Maybe more questioning,
study, deliberating, discussing with mahatma-s and scholars, etc. is
required. The present discussion is aiding such an endeavour.

I agree with you. 

Based on thesabdanityatvavAda and apaurshEya lakSaNa of shruti, there could be
vitaNDa vAdana that words of Bible & Quran are also apaurshEya. The vAda could be like this. 

The words of Jesus / Mohammad *existed prior* to their incarnation. So, Jesus & Prophet were only the medium through whom Bible & Quran were *revealed*. And hence, apaurshEya. 

How to tackle this problem.

regs,
sriram
