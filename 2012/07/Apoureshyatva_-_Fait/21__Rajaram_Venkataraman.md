RV: Contrariwise, history has ample evidence to show that right knowledge
destroys ignorance. It is a slow process but surely works. The
re-establishment of Veda apaureshyatva will reduce the reliance on
individuals who in turn don't rely on the Vedas.

 Purva Mimamsa stresses the importance of injunctions but as you know it
does  not negate the truth of non-injunctions. In 1.2.1, the opponent
starts the argument that any sentence which is not an instruction is not
eternal, not useful etc. Jaimini goes on to establish that they are valid.
