Please don't forget that Einstein did all this brainwork and used pen/pencil and paper. When his wife told him that the Royal society experimentally proved his findings Einstein told her that they wanted the proof and they got it. Einstein knew his work. So also the rishis knew their work.

According to my understanding of Mimamsakas, the rituals are also passed down through instruction from time immemorial. They have a sound logic to support it though it conflicts with our world view of biological and linguistic evolution.(I don't think the science is wrong but it is like deaf man trying to describe a drama. Science does not use sabda pramana.) 

We should not confuse that with grhya and srauta sutras, which are written down at some point in time for ease of following.

According to their logic, the mantras are eternal and passed down through 
oral tradition.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

But as I mentioned veda-s as a whole not mere maNtra-s, it has brAhmaNa 
portion as well, which is the description of rituals and formalities to be 
followed in those rituals like rAjasUya, agnishtOma, sOma yAga etc. And 
these details of vidhi-nishedha etc. are not maNtra-s perse. But having 
the details of the materials (pAtra sAdhana etc.) for which there is a 
particular time frame for designing (for example nail cutters) !!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
