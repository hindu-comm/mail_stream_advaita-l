OM
The word 'apourusheyA' is to be aptly understood as not born of human
effort,meaning,however knowledgable a human being can be the topic of
vedas deal with solution to human problems with a remedy of MOKSHA.
The very topic to understand needs adhikAritvam and shraddA. One needs a
GURU to teach VEDANTA.
The words positioned ina sentence have to be aptly and properly understood.
Swami Sarvabhutananda
________________________________________________________________________________
Even though the Vedas are "apourusheya",the adhikari is the human being.In order to understand them he requires a higher level of understanding,which is based on intuition.Since,Moksha cannot be understood by a mere word,the human being needs the importance of intuition.
N.Srikanta.
