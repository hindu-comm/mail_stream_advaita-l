OM
The word 'apourusheyA' is to be aptly understood as not born of human
effort,meaning,however knowledgable a human being can be  the topic of
vedas deal with solution to human problems with  a remedy of MOKSHA.
The very topic to understand needs adhikAritvam and shraddA. One needs a
GURU to teach VEDANTA.
The words positioned ina sentence have to be aptly and properly understood.
Swami Sarvabhutananda
