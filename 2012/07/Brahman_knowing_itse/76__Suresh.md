Many times, I have heard this argument. Brahman created the world to know itself. The logic goes like this: the eye cannot see itself, except as a reflection in the mirror. Likewise, the knower cannot know himself except by studying himself in a mirror, namely the world. 

So they say the purpose of creation is Brahman's desire to know himself. 

What do you think? Is there anything 'advaitic' about this?
