Dear Sri Balasubramanian
By referring to vomiting parrots do you have in mind the story in 
Thaitriyopanishad?Parrots did not vomit.They gathered the vomitted 
remnantsWhat  is wrong with that thread?Bhagavatham was narrated by Sri 
Sukha Brahmam.He wore the head of a parrot.The other threads were about Adi 
Sankaracharya `s parakayapravesam and by food I think you refer to the 
thread about meat eating etc.Some overtones were there but they were 
presented with a view to correct  the wrong perceptions.Mainly it is always 
one man`s pudding is another man`s poison.R,Krishnamoorthy.
