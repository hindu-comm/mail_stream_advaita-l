Namaste

There are some Youtube Sandhyavandana videos. Some Telugu Smartas are
doing with Shalya but there are two Srivaishnavas with no Shalya. Not
sure he has extra threads. He is not sitting properly also. He does
not have Arghya plate also for giving Arghya. How can they do Sandhya
like this?

One question is when having food should there be a Shalya or not? One
Brahmin is having food with not Shalya here. Is it correct?
