I have observed this practice of both men and women, while receiving the
phala/mantrAkShata prasad from the Guru, spreading their upper cloth.  Even
while receiving thirtha prasad people keep the cloth below their palms.
Recently a man while receiving the coconut and other prasad from the
sannyasi Guru, though in his upper cloth, dropped them as they were heavy
since he had not held the cloth tightly.  So, it is tricky and needs some
practice, care and tact.
