The braahmaNa vaakyam for the shalya is from taittiriiya aaraNyaka (of
the vomited stuff fame) 2.1. It starts saha vai devaanaam ...

As per saayaNas bhaaShya,

yaj~nopaviita-saadhanam dravyam vidhatte:

aji!na.m_ vaaso! vaa dak.si.na_ta u!pa_viiya_ - iti (using Wikners
notation for svaras)

kR^i.s.naajina-vastryor anyataradravyam dak.si.nabhaage lambamaanam
kR^itvaa adhiiyiite ityarthaH.

So, it is mandated by the vaakyam to wear either a deer-skin cloth or
an ordinary cloth with the right side starting off longer draped
appropriately for deva and manuShya yaj~nas.

But before you rush off and change your practice, note that local
practice may not conform to such injunctions. You should consult a
learned elder and also the older ladies who know about these things.
For example, the nambudiris don't seem to wear shalya either.

Not off topic - very on topic. I am tired of the multiple idiotic
threads on sex, food, vomiting parrots, etc., which have been going on
the last few months.
