Namaste,

vikacchOnuttarIyascha nagnascha avastrascha; shrauta smArtE naiva kuryAt

Without uttarIyaM, the dvija is considered to be digaMbara (nagnascha & avastrascha).
Such a person is not eligible for shrauta & smArta karmAs.

However, if accidentally, one forgets to have uttarIyaM, the *truteeya yajnOpaveeta* saves
the modesty. Hence, during yajnOpaveeta dhAraNa, the sankalpa made is

*uttareeyArthaM truteeya yajnOpaveeta dhAraNaM kariSyE*.

The prathama yajnOpavita is for brahmachAri as a part of upanayana samskAra 
to get the adhikAra for agni kArya. The dviteeya yajnOpavita is during *samAvartana*
ie, snAtaka mahOtsava. The truteeya yajnOpavita is for uttareeya.

So, one should don the uttareeya always without which one is unfit for shrauta & smArta karmAs. 

regs,
sriram
