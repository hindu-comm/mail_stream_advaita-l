Namaste

Can someone share a complete set of mantras recited during sandhyaavandanam, along with meaning ?

As Dr Sadananda has stated understand the meaning of these mantraas need to be practiced. (tajjapastadarthabhaavanam.h
.. 28..)


Thanks

Dr Yadu

PraNAms to all

While the discussion is interesting, the most important is to understad the meaning of the mantras and do it with that understanding in mind. Then sandhya vandana and in fact any vandana will be more effective.

Hari Om!
