sUryascha manyuscha manyupatayascha.

Hare Krishna

We chant sUryascha mA manyuscha manyupatayashcha manyukrutebhyaH etc. BTW, 
in our saMpradAya uttareeya or shalya is must and a dvija has to wear this 
always, not only during saNdhyAvandanaM.  Since it is not possible to wear 
due to T-shirts, round-neck shirts, shirts, casuals etc. nowadays, some 
saMpradAya suggests to wear an additional upaveeta instead of uttareeya 
with a saMkalpaM uttareeyArtham yajnOpaveeta dhAraNam karishye :-)) Hence 
you can see some of the gruhasthA-s wearing 3 upaveeta-s instead of two 
:-)

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
