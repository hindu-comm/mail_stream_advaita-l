In the context of the gItA verse you have cited, the night is the 
ignorance
of the ParamArtha tattva. One who does not know the ParamArtha tattva is
experiencing night, i.e. darkness, ignorance. 

praNAms Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji
Hare krishna

Thanks for your kind clarification prabhuji.  Like this geeta verse, I was 
just wondering whether we can find any arcane meaning to the siddhAnta-s 
that we see in jyOtisha and other grantha-s. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
