Namste,

Divya varsha is Solar year. The 12,000 figure for a mahAyuga only means that the unit of time is a year is for man. 


(1)
Can you please give your reason for ignoring the fact that Divya varsha is Solar year as given in the Vayu purana?

(2)
How can say that Manu Smriti is wrong?
(3)
How can you say that Mahabharata is wrong?


In my opinion the bulldozing is not the right way to establish facts.


Regards,

Sunil KB
