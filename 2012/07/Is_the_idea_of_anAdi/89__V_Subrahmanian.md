Thanks Shri Anand ji for an insightful post.  I am reminded of the
'unmeSha-nimiShotpanna-vipanna-bhuvanAvaLiH' of the Sri
LalitAsahasranAma.  [By Her opening and closing of eyes universes come
into being and disappear]

Another example of 'indeterminism' (anirvachanIyatA) coming from a
scientist? How true are Swami Vidyaranya's words!!

nirUpayitum Arabdhe nikhilairapi paNDitaiH |
ajnAnam purataH teShAm bhAti kakShyAsu kAsuchit || Panchadashi 6.

143: // Even if all the learned people of the world try to determine the nature
of this world, they will find themselves confronted at *some stage or other* by
ignorance.//  _

Swami Paramarthananda said that there are some 20 plus creation
theories doing the rounds in Scientists' discourses.  That there is no
unanimity, finality, with regard to creation among scientists sounds
very 'Vedantic' indeed.
