Namaste Dear Subbuji,

Pls correct me if i am wrong. 

To me, theory of evolution & cosmology seems to be inline with advaita siddhAnta of jagat mityAvAda. Infact, the definition exactly matches. 

The universe is evolving since times immemorial. Due to it's evolutionary process, 
it is subjected to change. The phase of evolution which was yesterday is not today;
which is today wouldn't be tomorrow; which would be tomorrow, won't be day after tomorrow. This scenario of change is like a film reel which goes on changing. 

So, this theory of evolutionis true asa part of vyAvahArika level. Due to theemphemeral state of this universe, it is termed as mithyA. However, all the scientific theories, evolutions, cosmological concepts, IMHO, can be fit into this vyAvahArika reality only which in my opinion are not contradictory to Sankara's observation. Jagat at vyAvahArika level do exist. However, in pAramArthika level, only the Brahman is the Substratum.

Therefore, i see no contradiction between scientific theory of evolution, cosmology and advaita siddhAnta.

Your comments are welcome.

regs,
sriram
