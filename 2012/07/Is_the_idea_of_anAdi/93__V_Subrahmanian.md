Dear Sriram ji,

Actually in this discussion thread no objection was raised to the evolution
theory from the siddhAnta angle.  Only within the vyavahAra there are
questions of Veda, dharma, etc. involved.  It is on these aspects the
discussion is going on.  Whether there can be a 'vyavasthita vyavahAra' in
these matters if evolution theory is admitted into Religion is the moot
question.
