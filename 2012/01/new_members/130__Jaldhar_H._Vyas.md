A fortunate student of Dr. T.S. Girishkumar, Reader, M.G. University,
Kerala.

  Doing PhD research in Advaita and New Science.

New Science means the Post-Newtonian Physical Science. to be precise,
I am looking for the similarities between Advaita and Science. Because of
the blessings of my Guru, Dr. Girishkumar and Sri Adi Sankaracharya himself,
I have found many things I was looking for like the elements of Advaitic
realities in Bohr, Heisenberg, de broglie, Einstein etc.

My research is expected to be complete by next month. Any kind
suggestions from the elders and the wise are gratefully welcomed.
