taittirIya upanishad 1.8 (om iti brahma ...) indicates that although not 
directly mentioned in the karmakANDa, it was there definitely in the
ritual context. taittirIya prAtiSAskhya also has a few sUtra-s on how
to pronounce omkAra, whether in udAtta or not, how elongated it
should be etc. This also points to its importance in a ritual context.

So if we take the veda not just as a received text, but as a text that
lives and is transmitted in its ritual context, om has a long established
place in the karmakANDa too. It was probably the basis for all the
stobhAskhara-s added during sAmaveda recitation.
