Here is a message that appeared in the Advaitin List:

//Namaskaram, I got access to the Dec 25, 2011 issue of the magazine "The
Week". It is a special issue with the main topic being Adi Shankara, with
several articles devoted to him and the mathas/places associated with him.
The cover page says: "Adi Shankara, Retracing a Great Journey; THE WEEK
takes the philosopher-saint's path across India". //

Two articles from the journal have been reproduced here:
