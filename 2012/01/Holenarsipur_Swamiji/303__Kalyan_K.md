Dear Sri Venkatesh,

You say that my knowledge is incomplete, but how is it incomplete? Isn't it
a matter of common perception that the world exists and the plurality is
seen everywhere? If the world is "as real as brahman", then doesn't it
contradict the saying of the Sruti that sarvam khalvidam brahma?

Isn't it a matter of everyday experience that people suffer from various
misfortunes? If their suffering is "as real as brahman" then how can you
say that everything is brahman?

You say that it is "reflections" that are suffering (whatever that may
mean). But if these "reflections" are "as real as brahman", then doesn't it
contradict the sruti statement that everything is brahman?

Even if I have an incomplete picture of things, how can you hold both
brahman and my own phenomenal existence to have the same level of reality
without violating sruti? Please throw some light.

Regards
Kalyan
