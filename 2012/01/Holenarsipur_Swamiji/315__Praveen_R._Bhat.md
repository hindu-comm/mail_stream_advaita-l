Hari Om, Venkateshji,

The drunkard from your example is more likely to say that the drink is
brahman too and its as real. If he thinks of the world as mithyA, it would
result in vairAgya via such viveka, a strong foundation for advaita
vedanta. You seem to have completely lost the fundamentals of adhyAtma
sAdhana with that weird example.

If I understood you correctly, you have come from stating what Gaudapada &
Shankaracharya should have said to what others who followed them should
have said! So, let alone the "highly negative" mAyAvAda, could you yourself
stop being negative about sampradAyA please? If not, be kind enough to drop
the subject that you have been taking on in circles while you avoid
answering all direct questions to you. Just disagree with everything that
all of us on this mailing list have said about mAyA, mithyA and stick to
sarvam khalvidam brahma. Suit yourself.

I particularly say this now because you contradict your own thoughts you
expressed only a few mails earlier! You initially had trouble that later
teachers have stuck onto Mayavada which was used by Bhagavatpada for
debates with dvaitis, etc, and that they should have changed. Now you are
saying that later teachers talked of Mayavada while Bhagavatpada did not!
All the teachers in the sampradAyA know what Shankaracharya said, didn't
say, or why he didn't say what you think he should have said. Its high time
you settle down with an acceptance that the sampradAyA won't change to
your, may I add meaningless, perspective.
