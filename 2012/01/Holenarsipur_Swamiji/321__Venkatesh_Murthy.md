The Pot is only in the thought of Brahman. It is real because it is
Brahman's thought. It is not false. But Brahman's thought is Dynamic
not Static. It is changing always. That is why the World is always
changing. It is not Static.

You cannot say Brahman's thought is like imagined Fantasy. For
ordinary men like us the thoughts may not be real. If I think of
elephant with wings it is not real. But Brahman is not like that.
Whatever Brahman thinks it will become reality. That is the Power of
Brahman's thought. He creates the world by simply imagining it. This
is the Power of Sankalpa of Brahman. He imagines it just for fun. This
is the Leela of Brahman.

You may have heard of Vishwamitra. For Trishanku he used his Tapas
Sakti to build a city between Svarga and Earth. If one Rishi
Vishwamitra can simply build a city withhis power can you imagine the
Power of Brahman? It is Infinite.

You cannot say there will be two things Pot and Brahman and Non
Duality is not there. Why? Because you cannot say Brahman and His
thought are two things. You cannot separate the two things. They are
One.

You, I and all the Jeevas are in the thought of Brahman. But we are
not realizing it. Our Jnana is incomplete.

See above. We cannot compare our imagination with Brahman's imagination.

It is not possible to refute the pure Advaita philosophy.
