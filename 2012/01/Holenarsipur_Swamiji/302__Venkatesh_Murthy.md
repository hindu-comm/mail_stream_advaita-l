I am saying Maya and Avidya theory is not necessary. If you are seeing
multiplicity of the world. You are not wrong. Your Jnana is
incomplete. You don't have Ajnana called as Ignorance. You are not
seeing the entire picture but a part of it. The entire picture is
Brahman is the base and World is the reflection. But you are seeing
the World reflection only. When you do Brahman Upasana you will see
the entire picture. The Sruti is saying to you Tattvamasi You are
That. You are Brahman but you are not realizing it. You are saying you
are suffering from misfortunes. Here also you have incomplete picture.
That is why you are suffering. You are Brahman. You cannot suffer. The
suffering is happening to your reflection. You are standing in front
of a mirror and someone scratches the mirror. You are thinking there
is a scratch on the face. But the scratch is only for the reflection.
The face is not scratched.
