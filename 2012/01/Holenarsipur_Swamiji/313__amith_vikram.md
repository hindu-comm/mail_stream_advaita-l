Dear Mr murthy,

Please stop embarrassing yourself by posting some nonsense. Adi
shankaracharya was an ocean of knowledge and mercy. His philosophy was
titiksha, vairagya, jnana nishta unlike the melodramatic 'bhakti'(biased,
filled with false sense superiority). If you want to know what is bhakti,
read bhaja govindam or shivananda lahiri. If possible, try to understand a
single verse.

If the world is real, why would anyone renounce? Are people crazy to be
doing all those tyagas and sacrifices while god has created this beautiful
world for us to enjoy. If everything is verily brahman, then there is
nothing to attain. But how to be free of hunger thirst and desires which
creeps in periodically? You must be knowing this, I am sure.
