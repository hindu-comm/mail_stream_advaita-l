Somehow, you don't realize that you contradict your own statement about "na
bhaviShyati" when you say that those teachings need to be changed for our
time.

The most important part you miss in qualifying here is that those teachings
were "without compromising or contradicting Bhagavatpada and advaita
tattva".

It was not a strawman raised only for the argument; its part of advaita
siddhAnta. A jaundiced eye can't cure the yellowish tinge of the world. The
medicine is to be taken by the patient and not applied to whatever is
perceived erroneously!

Unfortunately, all of your threads on the topic were strongly grounded ONLY
in dvaita and vishishtAdvaita perspective of advaita mithyA.

Maya always has the same role, without any change, na bhUto na bhaviShyati.
Those who find no use for mithyA have completely misunderstood mithyA. Like
your saying in another thread that the mirror being scratched doesn't hurt
the face. You completely err when you say that those who find that their
face is scratched then are not ignorant. They ARE ignorant. They ARE
aj~nAnis. You call it partial j~nAna; God only knows what that means! As
someone else said, you just cannot explain why anyone being brahman should
see multiplicity and suffer from a mirror scratched, without mithyA. That
reflection theory is meaningless if you can't answer why or what that
reflection is, but mithyA.

Its still better than driving the small civilian vehicle in circles
endlessly, neither reaching the office... worse yet, nor leaving home!!
