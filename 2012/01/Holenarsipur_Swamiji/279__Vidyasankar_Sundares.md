You just don't seem to get it. mAyAvAda is nothing more than pointing to
people that they are like children, playing and having fun in dirty water.
It is like the parent telling the child that at some point, it is necessary to
get out of the dirt and get cleaned up. You are blaming the messenger 
for the content of the message, a classic misdirection.

Moreover, you claim that the mature people are supposed to teach, "the
pot is brahman," "the clayis brahman" etc. It stands to reason then, that
they should teach the child, "the water is brahman," "the dirt in the water
is also brahman". So, why bother about cleaning up at all?!!
