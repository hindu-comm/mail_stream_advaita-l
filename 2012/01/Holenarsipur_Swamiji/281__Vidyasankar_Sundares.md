Okay, you have been given vast latitude to express your half-baked views on
this list. Some have tried to reason with you, others have tried engaging you
in other kinds of dialogue. At least one member has asked you to stop. After
asking you to cease the earlier thread, I let this go on for a while, just to give
other list members an opportunity to engage you in a discussion and hopefully
make it a meaningful one. Kudos to your unique ability to make all such efforts
quite meaningless very quickly. 

Your earlier thread began with a "report" and you started asking about the
"advaitin response" to it. The way the thread developed, it had nothing to do
with either the report or a response. It became merely a heading under which
you posted every single thought that happened to cross your head as if it were
well reasoned philosophy. Here we are, two weeks later, and you are doing
exactly the same thing all over again. What the Holenarsipur Swamiji said or
didn't say does not seem to be the focus of your questions here. For that
matter, you don't seem to listen to what anybody other than you says.   

So, you leave me with no choice but to pull the plug once again. Close this
thread out no later than midnight, Tuesday, Jan 31, 2012, Indian standard
time. I have again given you sufficient time to wind up, after giving you more
than sufficient space to air your thoughts. If you or any other list member
wants to continue this thread, take it offline. The patience of others on this
list is wearing thin.
