Read again and you will know that you didn't answer anything. You went
round and round to deceive yourself.

So, there are two things : world and brahman. And, world is brahman. Is it
sane to talk like this ?

Does 'everything' means brahman or world ? If first, then no problem.
Everyone knows that brahman is brahman. If second, then how can a thing
which is different from other, become one with that ? This is not what is
known by valid means of knowledge. So, it must be an outcome of daydreaming.

Being bauddha is not a crime. And thinking similar to them is also not so.
If bauddha-s can think properly as us, let it be so. Why do you hate
bauddha-s so much that their good things become intolerable to you ?

Correct. We just need a book for study. mAyA is not needed for study. :P

Definitely not. I mean that your understanding is not correct.

You must go out of this world to propagate this innovative view. People in
this world are not going to accept dreams, etc. real.

Again not so. I'm saying that you have distorted the whole picture.

Already said that because it is an agent for revelation of brahman.

Read again to understand question and then reply. Emotional replies worth
nothing. I'm not asking about mental condition of this type of GYAnI(!!).
I'm interested in reality, i.e how things actually are.

Actually we did. And others, including vishiShTAdvaitin-s, dvaitin-s did
the same.

For quality check read advaita-siddhi. You will understand how mithyAtvam
is correct.

Sorry, we have another ideas. You may create a new path like osho, j.
krishnamurthy, etc. and propagate it in your faithful disciples.
