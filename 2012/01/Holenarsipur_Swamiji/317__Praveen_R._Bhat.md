You brought the drunkard example to table expressing mithyatva and I am
saying its wrong. There is no use turning the tables on me now. I talked of
viveka vairAgya. A person who thinks of the world as mithyA is less likely
to turn to drinks and using his viveka, take to vairAgya instead. While
your drunkard is the one who is sitting and still drinking. So he doesn't
think that the world is mithyA, he thinks its real, drinks inclusive. Thats
what is likely to happen if you go around telling everyone that the world
is as real as brahman. Viveka is the most basic of sAdhana cAtuShTaya. Your
"brahmavAda" doesn't seem to have any use for viveka at all.

What I said has nothing to do with smashAna vairAgya. You seem to be
confused with what even that terminology means! Repeating sarvam khalvidam
brahma without applying viveka is whats truly useless.

I am saying there is a Positive Approach to Advaita without using Maya

Saying sarvam khalvidam brahma on one hand while tagging something as
positive and something else as negative is completely meaningless. So, no,
you're only thinking its the positive approach.

One cannot even turn to the Upanishads, let alone understand the message
without feeling the mithyatva of the world, ergo its uselessness. There is
absolutely no reason for anyone who thinks the world to be real to turn
away from it.


> Mithyatva was used to confuse Opponents in debates.


No its not. You seem to be thoroughly confused about what mithyAtva is.

There has been a history of saints in the tradition that have realized with
the method of sampradAyA. So all negativity and danger is only in your
mind.

And so did all teachers in the sampradAya.

Thats a wrong understanding. The Chief Philosophical Doctrine is in your
confused mind. Even the simplest of shAkhAcandra nyAya tells you that
brahman is the goal of all advaitis. If you are stuck in the shAkhA and
think that all advaitis do is show the shAkhA, then you can't be any
further away from the truth.

No true advaiti is bothered of what others misunderstand and call us.
Unfortunately, you're also on the other side calling Advaitis as Mayavadis!
Good luck returning.
