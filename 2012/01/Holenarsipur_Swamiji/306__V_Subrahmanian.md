I am not suggesting that saguNopAsana does not lead to mokSha.  I am aware
of the scriptural/Advaitic stand that saguNopAsana, through the method of
krama mukti, does lead to moksha.  But it is crucial to remember that even
in this krama the final mukti/moksha is had ONLY through nirguNa brahma
vidyA (in brahmaloka).  All I am saying in the above reply to Sri Venkatesh
is about the 'movement' from saguNa upAsana (consisting of karma yoga and
upasana) to nirguNa brahmavichAra IN THIS LIFE ITSELF is not without the
concept of mAyA which is essential for the transition from saguNa to
nirguNa.

I think you will have to go through the recent exchanges consisting of a
number of quotes from Shankara's bhashyam to understand the Advaita
prakriya.  Put in simple terms: Advaita as taught by Shankara cannot be
taught by anyone/practiced by anyone without the concepts of
mAyA/avidya/ajnana/moha/mithyatva, etc. in place.

On your observation:  //the necessity of these concepts for a sAdhaka is
debatable.// let me mention that for a saadhaka of the non-advaitic schools
these concepts may not be necessary since for them moksha is not advaitic;
there is a replica of samsara/duality/dependence in moksha in their
schools.  Hence the avoidability of these concepts could be possible/valid
in their systems.
