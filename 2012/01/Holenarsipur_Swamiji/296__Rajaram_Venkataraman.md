Rajaram: It is Friday evening but I am sober. I dont drink. So please take
this seriously :) By definition, a Sankara sampradayavit should know what
acharyas in the line of Sankara taught. Sankara knew what Gaudapada taught.
But he did not know what the later day acharyas such as Vidyaranya taught.
So, I am inclined to say that he is not a Sankara sampradayavit and will
score lower than Padmapada and Vachaspati Misra. Agree? Also, we often
think that Sankara knows his philosophy best and people like Sri
Subrahmanian tend to quote the acharya to prove what Sankara said expecting
others to take it seriously. But I argue that we know Sankara better than
he could have because we can learn all of his writings but at any any point
in time, he only knew what he wrote until then but not after. So, his
opinions are based on an incomplete knowledge of his own writings.

Please trust me that this is a serious post :) I have not concluded that
you can write anything on Advaita List about the tradition and its glorious
acharyas who dedicated their lives to uplift the masses.
