Namaste

A drunkard sitting in a bar can drink a few glasses and say 'The world
is not real. It is all Maya. It is all Mithya'. Why should we go to
Advaita Vedanta to listen to this message? Vedanta does not propagate
Mayavada. Adi Sankara did not propagate Mayavada. Some others coming
after him have spread the highly negative Mayavada philosophy. We must
avoid it. We have to follow the correct Vedantic goal. That is
Brahman. If possible try to understand Brahmavada priinciple Sarvam
Khalvidam Brahma.
