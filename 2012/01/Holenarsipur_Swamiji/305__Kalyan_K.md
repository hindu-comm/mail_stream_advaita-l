I do not exactly understand what you are suggesting above, but I think it
would be incorrect to say that saguNopAsana does not lead to moksha. I also
feel that while the concepts of mAya etc. are definitely necessary to
explain advaita (from a logical point of view), the necessity of these
concepts for a sAdhaka is debatable.

Kalyan
