Venkateshji, suppose I am a dvaitin who is debating with you on vedanta.
You tell me your position that everything is brahman. I ask you the
following question - If everything is brahman, then why I am perceiving
multiplicity in the world? I will say that the advaita philosophy that you
propound directly contradicts my experience. I will also say that I cannot
be brahman because brahman is free from all blemishes and sufferings while
I regularly suffer from misfortunes.

Without resorting to the concepts of maya/mithya/avidya, how will you
answer me?

Regards
Kalyan
