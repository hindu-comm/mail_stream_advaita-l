Just a brief comment on this line of thought. There needs to be no dichotomy
between a logical standpoint and what a sAdhaka needs to know for moksha.
Neither is a logician devoid of mumukshutva, nor does a mumukshu need to
leave logical thinking behind, at the very start of his or her sAdhana. 

This will be the last comment I contribute to this ill-named thread.
