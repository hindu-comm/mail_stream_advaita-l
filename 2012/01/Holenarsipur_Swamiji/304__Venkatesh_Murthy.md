What is 'real'? This is a difficult question. If you say a real thing
must be there for ever it is not correct. A  thing like a pot has the
base Brahman. Even if pot is destroyed the base Brahman is not
destroyed. If you call the pot is not real it is not correct. It is a
reflection of the real Brahman only.

Like this every object in the world is a reflection of Brahman.
Because it is coming from Brahman it is real. The multiplicity of the
world is coming from only One Brahman. If you see only the
multiplicity your knowledge is incomplete. It is not wrong.

There are two very important Brahma Sutras. First is  Lokavattu
Leelakaivalyam 2-1-33. Brahman has created the world as a Leela. It is
His pastime. The second important sutra is Sankalpadeva Tu Tat Sruteh
4-4-8. It is true Brahman has created the world as His Pastime. But
how did he create it? Just by a Sankalpa. He simply thinks 'I will
create the world like this' and it has happened exactly like the
thought. It means the World is existing in Brahman's thought.

When you see a Pot it is not only a Pot but a Pot created in Brahman's
thought. How can you say the Pot is not real? It is coming from
Brahman. What you see as Multiplicity of the World is in Brahman's
thought. It is not false like a Fantasy because Brahman's thought is
not Fantasy. He is the only Reality and he has this thought. His
thought is also real like Him. His thought is not different from Him.

But our knowledge of this thought is not there. We are seeing only
external objects. This Jnana is incomplete. We have realize by
Sagunopasana all this World is His thought. Then our Jnana will be
Complete.

Now you can read the above and tell me Where is Maya? It is not necessary.

This suffering is resulting from incomplete Jnana. When a man has
known his suffering is in the thought of Brahman and he is the same
Brahman he will not feel the suffering. It is all part of His Leela.

Yes the sufferings are reflections of Brahman but they are a part of
His thought.  Because they are in His thought they are real like Him.
His thought is not different from Him.

Your existing as a particular Kalyan is incomplete picture. It is a
part of the thought of Brahman and You are Brahman having the thought.
This is the complete picture.
