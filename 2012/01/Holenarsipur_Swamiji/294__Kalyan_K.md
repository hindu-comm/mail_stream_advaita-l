With all due respect Vidyasankarji, I think this discussion should not be
closed.  What if the same topic is started in another thread? How many
threads can be closed in this manner? Instead, I think Sri Venkatesh should
be asked to provide references for everything he writes. I know that you
have already done this before, without much success, but perhaps he should
be given another chance to state his central thesis and provide references
(from any bhAshyas, scriptures or published works) to back up his claims.
Let the members not respond to his messanges if no references are provided.
Then the thread will die automatically.

Regards
Kalyan
