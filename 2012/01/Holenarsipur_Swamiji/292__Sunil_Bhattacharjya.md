Dear friends, 


I think some scholars still believe that Adi Sankara was the first to use the words Maya, Mithya. To my knowledge, much earlier than Adi Sankara the Budhhist scholars like Vasubandhu used these terms, with almost similar meanings. So also many believe that the words Paramarthinka and Vyavaharika Satyas were first used by Adi Sankara. To my knowledge much earlier Nagarjuna used these words and probably Lord Buddha also did. As regards the Anirvachaniyatva can we say that the Nasadiya sukta itself gives the clue and so also the "Neti Neti". It was Adi Sankara, who for the first time extended the good work of Gaudapada and churned the Vedic texts comprehensively to spread the message of Advaita. It is said that even Lord Buddha desired that in future such an exposition should appear in this land.


Kindly correct me if I am wrong.

Regards,

Sunil KB

Who are you to tell this to us ? You are not an advaita-AchArya. Your
thoughts show that you are not even a student of this path.
And if you really want members of advaita-l to follow your foot-prints by
making them disciples, try to be more rational.

Do you think that you are the only one in this world who has contemplated
upon bhAShyam ?

SSS is not an authority on these issues. His path is different from
tradition in many ways and he and his words are pramANa for his followers
and if not in conflict with advaitAchArya-s then for us.

How could a person who has no faith in padmapAda, etc. is so faithful to
SSS ? Any hidden agenda ?

It seems that you hold that only sha~Nkara was capable of thinking and none
other can do that.
That's not true. Every person is capable of that and the result is seen as
different sampradAys-s of advaita.

Again, it appears that according to you advaita is only limited to words of
sha~Nkara and direct meaning of that.
That's again false. Any person who can think according to advaita keeping
in mind shruti, smR^its and yukti, is a contributer to advaita. Hence we
have texts other than that of sha~Nkara.

And what does 'being false' mean? sat or asat or both or 'you can't say' ?
This was asked in a previous thread. You just bypassed.

If you are a person who wants to test advaita-matam, then it will be better
to be neutral to reach correct result. First hear our objections, then
define your assumptions.

And what is that brahmavAda ?
Is it able to stand without mAya ?
Definitely not as is shown by many advaitain-s here.

So, world is real. Because it is created by brahman. This is not advaita of
sha~Nkara.
Are you trying to propagate vishiShTAdvaita in disguise in this forum ?

But he creates

So, he has a mind. And definitely he is not 'his mind'. So, he is a limited
brahman. Such is not brahman of veda-s.

So, he feels bored too. What type of brahman is this ?

It is His

Your such and such brahman is false, because he is limited. What to say
about his sa~Nkalpa.

He thinks about snake-in-rope and our dreams, they born mithyA. So, it
proves him mithyA-sa~Nkalpa !?

If shruti is trying to say what you are saying, then shruti is not a
pramANa. Why ? This type of thing is never seen to happen anywhere else and
hence is opposed to pratyaxa, etc.

If it came from him, then it is clearly different from him ? Child is not

Even if stone is accepted as an agent of revelation of brahman, it is
different from brahman. As a gem is different from light.

It appears as you have read too many books of different writers, so you are
uttering unrelated and baseless things. Before revealing your thoughts to
public, test them atleast.
