For Padmapada and other followers Maya=Avidya=Anirvachaniya=Mithya.
You think Sri SSS will agree to this? He will not agree
Mayavada=Anircahaniya Vada = Mithya Vada. He will not agree to Bhava
Rupa Avidya.

Padmapada and Vachaspati sowed the seed Maya Beeja called as Mula
Avidya in Sankara Advaita and watered it with the Mayavada theory. It
became a Big Tree and very hard to climb for all people. People are
looking at the Big Tree and saying Advaita is only Mayavada. They are
not seeing the Root of the Big Tree is in Brahman.

Is Sri SSS using the Anirvachaniya Vada in his arguments? Is he
calling Jagat as Sadasadvilaksana in his arguments? If not he is not
using Mayavada. He is saying indirectly Mayavada is not necessary.

I have given his views from the book as it is without changes. I don't
have a theory of Mayavada. As a matter of fact I am arguing we don't
need Mayavada. We have to take out the Maya Beeja Mula Avidya and
become pure Brahmavadis. The Upanishad is showing respect to
Brahmavadis only. It is saying Brahmavadino Vadanti.
