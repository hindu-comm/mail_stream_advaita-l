The above has no basis in the shAstram.  'Moving' to Nirgunopasana is
impossible without negating the guNas earlier meditated upon.  This
negation is not achieved without resorting to mAyA/mithyAtva.  Adi
Shankara's recommending saguNopasana is not at the cost of jettisoning
mithyAtvanishchayaH of the guNa-s/saguNabrahman.

Himself said this:

Shankara quotes in the sutra bhashya  a verse of Vyasa from the
Vishnupuranam (?) or Mahabharatha :

माया ह्येषा मया सृष्टा यन्मां पश्यसि नारद ।
सर्वभूतगुणैर्युक्तं मैवं मां ज्ञातुमर्हसि ॥

[Showing His vishwarupa to Narada He says:  This is My form created by Me
out of Maya.  You aught not to know Me as endowed with all this.]  The
message is:  In My absolute Nature I am devoid of any of these forms.  And
these forms include all the forms of gods, humans, etc. None of these is
Brahman.
