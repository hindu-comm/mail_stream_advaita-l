Namaste

The point I am trying to make now is also same Sri Kalyan was saying.
Maya has come into Advaita because of Bauddha influence. People are
asking for references but I am giving them and they are neglecting
them. What game is this?  Kindly look at the references. Some more are
here.

O.C.Handa page 58 Buddhist Monasteries of Himachal-
'Even the very concept of Maya may be of Buddhist Origin'.

A History of Early Vedanta Philosophy by Nakamura and Leggett Page 120-
'Maya-vada was vigorously criticized by other sects within the same
Vedanta school on the point that its thought resembles that of
Buddhist theories. Vijnanabhiksu also frequently discussed the problem
of the theory of the modern proponents of Maya Navina Maya Vadin and
commented they are crypto Buddhists and a section of the Buddhists
that superficially they are those who call themselves Vedantists
Vedantibruva but that actually this thought is not Vedanta theory Na
Tu Tad Vedantamatam. Bhaskara says the proponents of Maya are men who
rely on Buddhist theories Bauddhamatavalambin. Vallabha called the
proponents of Maya another incarnation of Madhyamika itself
Madhyamikasay eva aparavataraha. Yamuna too says that Mayavada and the
Vijnanavada are essentially identical and that difference exists only
in the fact that the latter is an open Buddhist Prakata Saugata the
former is a crypto Buddhist Pracchanna Saugata and Ramanuja asserted
that the thought of the crypto Buddhist who makes a pretence of the
Veda vada resembles Vijnanavada.'

Here it means a non Self thing is superimposed on the Self. The Non
Self is false. There are only two type of things. Self and Non Self.
The Self is real. The Non Self is not. This is one theory.

Brahman is the Only Reality. This is Brahmavada. It does not mean the
world is Mithya or false. It means the world also is Brahman.

Yes because everything is Brahman. Even if you say the word Maya that
word Maya is Brahman only.

This is wrong conception. Maya is introduced following some Bauddha
type reasoning. It is not required for Upanishadic study.
Maya theory has Bauddha influence. It is Asacchastram truly.

I am saying Brahman is truly everything in the Universe. Visistadvaita
will not say that. I am also saying all objects in the world are
created in the thought of Brahman.

For explaining Creation of World we have to explain Saguna Brahman.
With Nirguna Brahman you cannot explain Creation.

Then you are saying Sruti is also saying false things.

Even the Snake and Mirage Water are in the thought of Brahman. They
are real. His thought is real. Satya Sankalpa.

How is stone different? For a Jnani a stone and a gem are equal. Both
show Brahman only. He sees Brahman only everywhere all the time.

Mayavada theory must have been tested before they brought into
Advaita. No quality check done. That is why we have to do some changes
now.

One very important advantage arguing with all the people is my faith
in the Brahmavada theory has increased 100 times. I will never look at
Mayavada again in my life. Thank you all.
