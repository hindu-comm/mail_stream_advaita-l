If Venkatesh (or for that matter any list member) continues this 
fact-free blathering on subjects clearly not understood with imprecise and 
often inflammatory language then they will be placed on 
moderation or expelled.  End of problem.

Which he has been asked from day one.  I understand that not everyone is 
an accomplished scholar in shastras.  That is not necessary to participate 
in advaita-l.  But we can safely demand that participants follow basic 
norms of rational debate.  This is not a private soapbox to spew out any 
notion which might enter ones skull.

If we are not mature enough to control our own thoughts and speech its a 
sign we shouldn't be involved in Advaita Vedanta at all.  It is not anyone 
elses job to babysit.
