Another example. Mayavada is saying avoid the water because it is
dirty to the thirsty man. Brahmavada is saying the water may be
looking like dirty water. Don't avoid it but purify it and drink it.
The dirty water has pure water as the base. Get the base. Here in
India we are always using water purifiers at home and drink it. If you
say give up the water people will die of thirst.

If you have faith you can say the mantra 'Aushadhi Jahnavi Toyam
Vaidyo Narayano Harihi' and drink it. Nothing will happen. Many
stories are there. The enemies of a King put poison in Teertha Prasada
in a temple. But the King had great faith and he accepted as God's
Prasada. The poison did not harm him.
