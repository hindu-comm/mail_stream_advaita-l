Are you saying we can take drinks saying it is Brahman? Are you saying
we can take drinks say the World is Mithya and get Vairagya? I did not
say that. The Smashana Vairagya you are saying for a drunkard is
useless. Even Arjuna had that kind of Vairagya in the battle field.
But it is useless.

I am saying there is a Positive Approach to Advaita without using Maya
and Mithyatva. The Message of the Upanishads is Brahman not Maya and
Mithyatva. That is why we say Brahma Sutra not Maya Sutra or Mithyatva
Sutra. Mithyatva was used to confuse Opponents in debates. It may be
useful for that purpose. I agree. But for daily Sadhana it is negative
and dangerous.

Adi Sankara talked Avidya and Adhyasa. But he talked Brahmavada also.
He did not stress Mithyatva that much. But for others Mithyatva became
the Chief Philosophical Doctrine and Brahmavada got pushed to
background. That is why others are calling Advaitis as Mayavadis. We
are Brahmavadis.
