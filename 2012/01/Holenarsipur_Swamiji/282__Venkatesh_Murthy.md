Namaste

It is difficult for me to believe the simple idea  Maya is planted
into pure Advaita is so difficult to understand.  I am saying a simple
thing. Give up the complicated Maya Jala and do Brahmopasana. That is
all.

Adi Sankara has not propagated the idea of Anirvachaniya Avidya and
the two Avidyas. But it was started later.

Holenarsipur Swamiji has written about Vachaspati in Page 101 How to
Recognize the Method of Vedanta -

'In almost all instances of his defence of Sankara against the attacks
of Bhaskaracharya, we find the Anirvachaniyavada is the one handy
weapon un-sheathed to repulse the opponent.'

In Page 98 -
'The Panchapadika however enters upon a tediously long discussion to
refute all views other than the theory of Anirvachaniya Khyati which
is elaborated at great length, never invoking the support of the
Bhasjya for any of the opinions advanced in that connection.'

What is Anirvachaniya Vada? Same as Mayavada. Same as Mithyatva Vada.

We can now say two things. A The Anirvachinaya Vada is not supported
in Sankara Bhashya. B It is not necessary for understanding Advaita.
All the Sadasadvilakshana Vada was used to confuse Opponents in
Debates. It is not necessary.

Holenarsipur Swamiji is saying Sankara Bhashya has used only
Adhyaropa Apavada Vada. A false thing is superimposed and removed. But
Adi Sankara has used Brahmavada very strongly in arguments in the
Bhasya. The Creator of the World is Brahman. It is unnecessary to
bring in another thing called Maya to explain Creation. But he creates
the world with his Sankalpa thought only. He does not have to do any
work actually. He is doing this creation for having fun. It is His
Leela. Lokavattu Leelakaivalyam sutra 2-1-33 is clear. Moreover
Brahman's Sankalpa cannot be false. He is called as Satya Sankalpa.
Whatever He thinks will be real only. It will never be false. The
World created by Him is also real. But it is only His thought. It is
in Him. It is not different from Him. That is why every object is a
reflection of Him only. That is why the Sruti is saying Sarvam
Khalvidam Brahma.

The Bruhadaranyaka Sruti is saying Purnamadaha Purnamidam Purnat
Purnamudachyate. Adi Sankara has explained this. This Universe has
come from the Infinite Purna Brahman. It is not different from Him.

But a question can be asked? How is it possible for a Jada Vastu like
a stone to be Brahman? In pure Advaita there is no Jada vastu at all
like the Visistadvaita says Acit Vastu. Instead of Acit or Jada or
Achetana Vastu in pure Advaita the stone is not revealing Brahman to
us. But Brahman is there in it.

Another question. If the world is Brahman how is there suffering and
cruelty in the world? The World is created in Brahman's thought as a
Game for fun. In a Game we suffer sometimes defeat sometimes we get
victory. We cannot always be winning. We have to smile even in defeat
because we can play well in the next game. Better Luck Next Time.

Life is a Game played by God. We have to be good sportsmen. Exercise
well and play well. We cannot take Life very seriously because it is
only a Game.

The Sruti is also saying Nirguna Brahman is the only thing existing.
We all are That only. By doing Sagunopasana we can realize we are part
of Brahman's Sankalpa thought only. This will lead to Nirguna Brahman
directly.
