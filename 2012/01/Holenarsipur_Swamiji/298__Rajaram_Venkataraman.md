Rajaram: There are two roles as always and there is no need to change
Sankara's teachings.(Who are we to do that anyway?)The first is to explain
the appearance of duality. You also attribute a cause of duality saying it
is absence of knowledge. There are reasons why this ignorance is considered
a positive entity. The second is for sagunOpasana. Though saguna brahman is
beyond names and forms, we worship Him/Her as with names
and forms. To worship any form of Ishwara, we need to understand that they
are due to His maya shakti, non-different from Him.
