About the author

The original was written in Hindi by Sadhu Nischala Das about 150 years ago and since then the original book has been translated into many languages including Tamil, Telugu etc. Sri Vasudeva Brahmendra Saraswati Swamiji, a great scholar and teacher who had Asshram on the banks of Cauvery in Mayuram translated it with commentary and extensive foot notes. This work was later published with the help of Union Ministry of Education and Kanchi Kamakoti. Because of the popularity of the book the second publication was taken up by TTD, Tirupati.  There are English and tamil translations available on line of the original Hindi book. This much I could gather from the publisherâ€™s note. The Sanskrit translation and commentary is much more extensive and Swami Paramarthanandaji is started taking this text few weeks ago at Astika Samaj on Saturday  Mornings from 7Am-8AM. If anyone is more familiar with the works of Sadhu Nischala Das please feel free to add. Since I
 was very much impressed by the commentary, I decided to share my notes expanding whatever I could to make the notes understandable. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
