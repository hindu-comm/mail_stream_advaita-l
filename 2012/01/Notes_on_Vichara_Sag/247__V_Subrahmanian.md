On Fri, Jan 27, 2012 at 9:12 AM, kuntimaddi sadananda < Also worth
mentioning is The Tiruppavia of Godadevi that is in classical Tamil, my
father has translated it with extensive commentary in Telugu as Melinomu
and was published by TTD.

Namaste.

The Tiruppavai (Tamil) has been rendered in Sanskrit by Sri
SudarshanAchArya (period not known) and the entire set of 30 songs were
recently posted, one per day, by a scholar with commentary in Sanskrit in
the Bharatiyavidwatparishad group.
