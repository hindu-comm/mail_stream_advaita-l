This is the fundamental problem. You can end up in Brahman showing the
world is Mithya. A better way is show the world is Saguna Brahman only
and then  even that Saguna Brahman is Pure Consciousness Chit. The Big
problem created by Mayavada debates with other Vedantis will vanish.

Sruti has many Vakyas to proclaim Saguna Brahman like Sahasra Sirsha,
Antarbahishca Tat Sarvam Vyapya Narayanaha Sthitaha etc. But many
Advaitis have neglected Saguna Brahman. There is too much focusing on
Mayavada.

The advantages of giving up Mayavada by Advaitis are great. There will
not be big debates on Mayavada with Dvaitis and Visistadvaitis and
other Bhakti type followers. Second advantage is Unity of Brahmins.
All Brahmins should be firm followers of Saguna Brahman. In Vyavahara
Reality Saguna Brahma is the Ultimate. We have to bow to Him. The
others except Advaitis all believe in Saguna Brahman and practicing
Theistic principles. But Mayavada can result in Atheism. This is very
bad for Brahmins. If Advaitis give up Mayavada and accept Sagunopasana
like the others there will not be much debates and quarrels.
Sagunopasana is Positive Approach. Mayavada is Negative Approach.

You have misunderstood. We are not only telling God is everywhere but
also that God is also final Nirguna Brahma only. God is the way to
Nirguna Brahman. If some one is very inquisitive he can understand the
final Doctrine.

Kindly see the advantages of giving up Mayavada above. Saguna Brahma
Upasana is the Theist approach. Mayavada can easily takes us to
Sunyavada,

The problem is too less focus on Saguna Brahman and too much on
Mayavada. Kindly see above.
