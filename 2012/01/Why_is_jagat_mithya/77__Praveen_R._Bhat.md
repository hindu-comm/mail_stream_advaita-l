The focus of the shruti is both, brahman and non-brahman because
without knowing the latter's relation to former, the former is just
impossible to achieve.

The advaita vedanta books, fortunately, do not sit on their high
pedestal of brahmatattva or paramArthikA and ask you to join there,
leaving your entire belief rooted in this jagat. How much ever you say
that world is brahman, a laukika will never be able to bridge the
disconnect, unless you do what advaita vedanta books instead do, which
is to hold the hand of the one completely covered in aj~nAna that this
world is a reality to take him to that which is the substratum of the
world. In other words, a good teacher comes down to the level of the
student and takes him above and into the beyond. Such teaching
understands the natural tendencies and difficulties of the student.

People who are afraid that purNa is like shUnya are sadly mistaken, IMHO.

This is exactly what advaita vedanta does, but knowing that not a
single medication is applicable to all diseases. What if a person of a
different temperament than yours is told sarvam khalvidam brahma and
he thinks that this world is verily brahman, why should I bother for
any sAdhanA at all then? Why not achieve the best of this world and
live in it like a charavAka follower?
