Namaste

Some questions.

What is the focus of Sruti? Brahman or non Brahman? In Advaita books
the focus is more on non Brahman and showing it is Mithya. Why not
focus on Brahman because it is the One and Only Sat? Because it is
Nirguna it is difficult to focus on it. It is easier to say what is
not Brahman. Yato Vaco Nivartante Sruti is prohibiting from describing
Brahman.  Is this correct reason?  We negate everything and what is
left is  Brahman. Some people are afraid of this because they feel it
is like Sunya.

There could be another way. We can say Brahman is there in everything.
Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma. This is a positive way. What is difficult in
this? We can do Brahman Upasana in everything. But you can say we
cannot do Upasana like that because Brahman is Nirguna. Then do
Upasana of Saguna Brahman in everything first.
