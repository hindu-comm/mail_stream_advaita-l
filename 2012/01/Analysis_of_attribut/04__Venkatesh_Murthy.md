Namaste

In Gita 6-16 Krishna has said a Yogi has to be Yuktahara. If he eats
too much he will fail. If he eats too less he fails again. The rich
man eats too much and the poor man cannot eat enough many times. The
middle class person being not rich not poor can eat enough quantity
for success. Like this Yuktavihara is possible for the not rich not
poor man but the other two find it difficult.

Yuktaceshta. The rich man has too much recreation and sometimes too
much hard work. The poor man has too less recreation. The middle class
man has enough recreation.

Yuktasvapnavabodha. The rich man and the poor man cannot sleep regular
hours. The rich man has to be awake enjoying late night parties and
the poor man works in night shift many times. When the others are
awake they are still sleeping. The middle class man cannot spend money
in late night parties and and he can work comfortably in the day time
and sleep in regular hours.

I am not saying rich and poor class cannot succeed but it will be
difficult for them.
