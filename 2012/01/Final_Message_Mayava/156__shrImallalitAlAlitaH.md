That's not true. Is there any word like that in bhAShya-s itself ?

If you mean saMsArI by dull people, then you are correct. No moxa-shAstra
says that it's adhikArI is mukta. So, every advaitin who feels that he is
not mukta, accepts mAyAvAda.

There are some great souls which are free from world. We don't talk about
them.

If you feel that we must go forward leaving mAyAvAda, then declare yourself
a mukta first and hence reject all shAstra-s.

For understanding scriptures are enough. mAyA is needed to secure validity
of scriptures and is also supported by scriptures.

Being trapped ? Are you saying this for advaitin-s of sha~Nkara ?
What does it mean ?
Accepting mAyA to explain mithyA jagat and save validity of veda-s is being
trapped, then not accepting mAyA to prove world real is what ?

it is like reading only first chapter of the book.

Even that is better than 'commenting without touching the book'.
