Yes of course.  But have you considered why this darshana is called 
advaita ("not-two") rather than aikya ("one")?

Exactly.  Duality is the normal every day experience.  "Everyone knows" 
the sun rises and sets until they learn the science of astronomy when they 
realize that what "everyone knows" is wrong.  In the same way, it is 
only when one learns the Vedanta shastra that the maya that "everyone 
knows" is revealed as false.
