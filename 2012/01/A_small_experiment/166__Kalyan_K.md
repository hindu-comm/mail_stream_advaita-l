Namaste Venkatesh-ji,

Please count how many times the word "brahman" appears (it appears many
times). Please count how many times the words Self/Atman appear.

In the very first verse, Govinda is being invoked. I think you have reached
your conclusion without a proper enquiry.

I will be out of town for a few days and will reply to further posts later.

Regards
Kalyan
