The complete book with the (only) commentary published by the Vani Vilas
Press, Srirangam, (year not known) is now with me.

The very first verse has the word 'shakteH' for which the commentator
writes:शक्तिः मायाशक्तिः .

Verse 5 ends with the words: जहि *मोहमयं भ्रममात्ममतेः* । The commentary
says: ननु केन साधनेन मिथ्याज्ञानस्य परिमोचनमिति ?...आत्मज्ञानेन
*मोहमयाविद्याकार्यं
भ्रमं* ...जहि...

Verse 30.  vitathatvamatiH [the knowledge of its fasity]....rajjusarpa

v. 45: अनृतत्वम्...

I am giving below the verse numbers where the unreality of the effect and
the reality of the cause is established by a number of methods.  The shruti
/smriti are extensively used both in the verses as well as in the
commentary.  62 has the word 'asatyam'. 72 has the word 'adhiropita' as a
synonym for the word 'adhyaropita'. 95 has the word 'anRta' (unreal/false -
as the opposite of the word Rtam that is found in the 6th verse I had
already referred to.)  107,114 onwards up to 173 some 60 verses talk
repeatedly, in the most explicit terms, about the unreality of the effect
(the body, especially the mind, the triad of states which accounts for the
entire world) and the sole reality of the Cause, the Sat, Brahman/Atman.
The set of verses covered here almost reads like the GaudapadakArikaa and
the Shankara bhashya thereon.  In verse 162 the relativity of day-night
pair and the absoluteness of the ever-bright Sun is talked about and
likewise the relativity of the bondage-liberation pair with reference to
the ever-liberated Atman is stated.  168 says ' in you the triad of states
is just a superimposition and therefore asat.'  The teaching ends with the
aspirant declaring his enlightened state by saying 'I will henceforth move
about in the world looking upon it as mere mirage-water'.

Thus the work 'shruti sAra samuddharaNam' is replete with the concept of
mAyA-avidyA though these very words are absent.  All effects of this pair
is elaborately discussed both in the verses as well as in the commentary.
All the misconceived ideas about Vedanta/Advaita/Gaudapada/Shankara that
were expressed in the recent posts are set at rest in this work.

I am enthused to take up a detailed study of this work along with the
commentary, thanks to Sri Rajaram for the original question on this work.
