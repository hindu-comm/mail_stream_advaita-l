Brahma Satya Jagad Brahmaiva Jeevo Brahmaiva instead of Jagan Mithya. Everything is Brahman only

mAyAvAda is not a fanciful idea that sprung up from the mind of Sankara. 

Even Ashtavakra Samhita which is the dialogue between Ashtavakra & Janaka 
has several references to illusoriness of the world. 

The 11th sloka of 3rd chapter says:

“mAyA-mAtraM idaM vishvaM pashyan vigata kautukaH”

The 1st chapter has the sloka which refers to “rajju-sarpa bhrAnti”:

“yatra visvaM idaM bhAti kalpitaM rajju-sarpavat”

sriram
