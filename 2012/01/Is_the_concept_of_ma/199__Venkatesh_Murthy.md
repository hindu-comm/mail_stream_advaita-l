Namaste

Maya is not necessary to explain Advaita. We can say Brahma Satya
Jagad Brahmaiva Jeevo Brahmaiva instead of Jagan Mithya. Everything is
Brahman only.

Another Professor from USA Anantanand Rambachan-
'He insists that for the great teacher Sankara, all that exists is
non-different from Brahman, which emits the world much as a spider
spins out its web.Rambachan argues that the principle of Maya as a
secondary creative principle and the source of illusion is an
unnecessary later accretion that merely contributes to the erroneous
idea that knowing the one devalues the many. For him the world has
value as the celebrative expression or overflow of Brahman's
undiminishing limitlessness.' - Dualities: A Theology of Difference
