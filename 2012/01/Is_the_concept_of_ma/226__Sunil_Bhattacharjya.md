Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya,

Dear friends,

If I may share my views and put the things in a somewhat elaborate way. 

In the Vyavaharika level the Avidya theory. indicates what is at the 

paramarthika level. At the Paramarthika level, to be more precise at the 

level of Apara Brahman or the the Para-Prakriti level also including the 

Jivanmukta level the theory of Maya is really meaningful for describing the 

Vyavaharika level. . At the level of Para Brahman, of course no examples 

or propositions or logic need to be used.

Regards,

Sunil KB

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Is the concept of maya essential to explain advaita?

Hari Om

I understand in the following way.

The explanation about the advaita is made from the realm of two levels of
realtiy or satta
a) the vyavaharika satta ot transactional reality level wherein avidya -
maya or reflection theory or limitation theroies are used to indicate the
Absolute.
b) in paramarthika satta level or the absolute reality level no examples or
propositions or logic needs to be used. A statement is made or several
statements are made about the same Absolute.

Hence, it is important to see from which level of reality or satta we wish
to understand/ Understand. hence, the answer to the question is

from the paramarthika satta avidya - maya or theories are not required
from vyavharika satta these are required to refer to the Absolute truth.


Salutations to the Absolute seen through this mail ( even this is
Vyavaharika Satta)

Hari Om
