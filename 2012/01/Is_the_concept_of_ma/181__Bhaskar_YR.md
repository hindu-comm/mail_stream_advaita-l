praNAms Sri Venkatesh prabhuji
Hare Krishna

The example Mayavadi is using is Snake and Rope Illusion. 

>  If you call advaita saMpradAya Acharya-s as mAyAvadin-s, then yes, both 
gaudapAda & AchAya shankara use this analogy at various places in their 
works.

He is saying after Jnana of Rope Snake will get destroyed. 

>  Yes, this is true.  No more snake after realization of rope.

Nobody will say I am seeing Snake and Rope both. 

>  Yes, you are right. 

My conclusion about Mayavada is correct.

>  No, your conclusion about rope & snake analogy is correct.  And it is 
correct to the extent of rope & snake analogy only :-))

He will say World is like Snake will get destroyed when we realize
Brahman. 

>  No!! mAyAvadins like shankara says after realization of brahman by the 
jnAni, he would see the jagat as brahman only nothing else.  Please see 
chAndOgya maNtra bhAshya 6.2.3. shankara bhagavatpAda exactly uses this 
analogy to explain that kArya jagat is nothing but kAraNa brahman in its 
svarUpa.  Here he answers a question:  asadeva tarhi sarvaM yadgruhyate 
rajjuriva sarpAdyAkAreNa??  The purpose of this analogy is not to prove 
jagat mithyatva, it is there to drive home the point that that which is 
appearing as 'snake' (jagat) is nothing but 'rope' (brahman). 

I am saying this about Mayavada correctly. Kindly read my earlier message 
in detail.

>  As I told you earlier prabhuji, it is not an advaitin's responsibility 
to clarify each & every fancy idea of mAyAvAda by a stranger when it is 
not ably supported by authentic advaita works. I have read more fanciful 
definitions of mAyAvAda and advaita in Srila prabhupad's books!! But what 
matters ultimately is a relevant quote from the saMpradAyavit's works. But 
unfortunately in all your definitions it is quite conspicuous by its 
absence. 

>  So, be kind enough to provide appropriate quotes for your definitions 
before making any sweeping statements/conclusions about mAyAvada in 
particular and advaita siddhAnta in general.  Hope you would do the 
needful in this regard in your subsequent mails.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
