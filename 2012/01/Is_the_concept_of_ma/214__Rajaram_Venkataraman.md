Rajaram: I see the merit of this argument. But Shri R. Balasubramanian says
that it is not required. He is not saying that in an academic publication
but as a foreword to a book by a traditional mutt (Shakatapuram). So, I am
not able to discount his point of view that Sri Totakacharya does not use
the concepts of Maya and Avidya in Srutisamuddharana to teach Advaita. It
is for the same reason that though I respect Shri Srubrahmanian's opinion,
I am not able to discount the opinion of Shri R. Balasubramanian based on
the former's quick analysis of a couple of verses.

Note: My opinion is not that maya or avidya concept is not required. I am
trying to determine whether it is an useful tool or an essential tool.
