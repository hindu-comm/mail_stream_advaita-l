Rajaram: I agree with Shri Subrahmanian because he showed evidence that the
concept exists though the words do not. But Shri R. Balasubramanian is not
saying that these words do not exist in the text. I quoted him verbatim at
the start of the thread. And repeat it here: "Though the *concept* of
maya-avidya is important in Advaita, there is no reference to it in the
text. ... The reason for this is that it is quite possible to explain the
central thesis of Advaita without bringing in the *concept* of maya-avidya
... "
