Please clarify with an yes or no.

>From a vyavahara perspective, the world is said to be unreal.
No, from vyavahara perspective the world is very much real.
>It islikened to a dream.
No, dream has a lesser level of reality.Examples are given to make us understand the concept.

>But Ishwara is considered to be real not comparedto a dream. Therefore, my understanding is that Ishwara has higherreality than jagat in advaita. Is that right?
Brahman with his maya shakti becomes Ishwara who is the supporter of all these activities and has a reality to that level.

>Now, the jagat karanatvam is a tatastha lakshana of Ishwara but He
exists (beyond time and space) even when jagat does not. Is that
right?
Is it Brahman or Ishwara??? Swaroop and tatastha lakshana are spoken for whom.

>At this stage, His maya shakti exists as His aisvarya non-different
from Him as well just as sun and its heat are inseparable. Is that
right?

>The essential nature of this Ishwara (jiva and jagat) is called
Brahman, beyond all philosophical constructs. Is that right?
Ultimately all this is Brahman but because of avidya we hardly fail to realize thisregardsS.Kabra
