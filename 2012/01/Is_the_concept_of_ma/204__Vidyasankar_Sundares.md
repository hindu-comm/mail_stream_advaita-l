Who is saying that ISvara Sakti is mithyA? Name one author in
the advaita tradition who describes ISvara-Sakti as mithyA. Do
not point to translations with the words God, illusion, delusion,
lordly power etc. in the English language. Cite a Sanskrit text.
If you can successfully find even one statement to that effect,
I would be very interested in it.
