Namaste Sunilji,


>The Nasadiya Sukta shows the helplessness of the created entities in assessing the capability and attributes of the Brahman, which >cannot be an object separate from any other entity. Only an object, separate from the observer, can be studied well. At the time >of revelation of the Nasadiya sukta the Bhagavad Gitopanishad was not revealed. It may be for that reason that the Lord revealed i>n the Bhagavad Gita that he created using his Maya (referMayoya).


Sri sAyaNa mentions that the rishi of the nAsadIya sUkta is paramAtma,
under his appellation parameshThin. From the vishNu sahasranAma, we
know that parameshThin is one of the names of Lord Vishnu. An obvious
question is - why did the same Lord who is the seer of this mantra,
give us such a vague picture of creation in this sUkta? An interesting
fact is that Lord Vishnu, in the form of nArAyana rishi also happens
to be the seer of purusha sUkta, which gives us a completely different
account of creation. Perhaps, this is a good way to show that creation
is mAya.


Regards

Kalyan
