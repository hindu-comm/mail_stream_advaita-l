Hari Om

I understand in the following way.

The explanation about the advaita is made from the realm of  two levels of
realtiy or satta
a)  the vyavaharika satta ot transactional reality level wherein avidya -
maya or reflection theory or limitation theroies are used to indicate the
Absolute.
b) in paramarthika satta level or the absolute reality level no examples or
propositions or logic needs to be used. A statement is made or several
statements are made about the same Absolute.

Hence, it is important to see from which level of reality or satta we wish
to understand/ Understand. hence, the answer to the question is

from the paramarthika satta avidya - maya or theories are not required
from vyavharika satta these are required to refer to the Absolute truth.


Salutations to the Absolute seen through this mail  ( even this is
Vyavaharika Satta)
