The problem for me is not that VM holds unpopular views or trusts the 
wrong authorities but that he has a penchant for coming to a conclusion 
first and then casting about for support for it.  This is not acceptable 
in any rational discipline Western or Eastern.

Start with the primary sources.  The works of Shankaracharya are readily 
available for perusal.  If there is anything unclear then resort to 
secondary sources whether pandit or professor.  Then come to a conclusion. 
If one lacks the technical skills in Sanskrit etc. to do this then stop 
speculating until the skills are acquired.
