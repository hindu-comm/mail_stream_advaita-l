“mAyA-mAtraM idaM vishvaM pashyan vigata kautukaH”

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

mayAntu prakrutiM vidyAt mAyinantu maheshwaraM, says shruti.  daivee 
hyeshA guNamayI mama mAyA duratyayA says lord in geeta..I dont know why we 
should lend our ears to someone who questions the importance of certain 
concepts in advaita when shruti, smruti, paramAchArya taken these concepts 
(mAyA, avidyA etc.) to educate us world phenomena!!  na hi tayA (mAyA) 
vinA parameshwarasya srushtatvaM siddhyatiH shakti rahitasya tasya 
pravruttyanupapatteH clarifies shankara in sUtra bhAshya 1.4.3. 

If these prabhuji-s are not comfortable with these terminologies, and 
thinking that these concepts are doing harm to advaita vedAnta, let them 
teach their own veda, advaita without using these terminologies.   I hope 
nobody is stopping them from doing this service to adhyAtmika prapancha.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
