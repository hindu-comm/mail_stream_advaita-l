Wonderful. All I will quote in response is this,

You ought to know where this is from. Please try to understand what it means
for what a jnAnI "sees", why and with what.

And to close, let me reiterate that all the confusion lies in your head. You refuse
to engage in proper study and you prefer to "understand" advaita largely through
what its critics say about it. No wonder you are confused. Do not blame the so-
called bogey of "mAyAvAda" for your confusion. All the mAyA and all the vAda
is of your own making!
