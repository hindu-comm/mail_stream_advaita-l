The example Mayavadi is using is Snake and Rope Illusion. He is saying
after Jnana of Rope Snake will get destroyed. Nobody will say I am
seeing Snake and Rope both. My conclusion about Mayavada is correct.
He will say World is like Snake will get destroyed when we realize
Brahman. I am saying this about Mayavada correctly. Kindly read my
earlier message in detail.
