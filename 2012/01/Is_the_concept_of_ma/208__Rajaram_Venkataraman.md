Please clarify with an yes or no.

>From a vyavahara perspective, the world is said to be unreal. It is
likened to a dream. But Ishwara is considered to be real not compared
to a dream. Therefore, my understanding is that Ishwara  has higher
reality than jagat  in advaita. Is that right?

Now, the jagat karanatvam is a tatastha lakshana of Ishwara but He
exists (beyond time and space) even when jagat does not. Is that
right?

At this stage, His maya shakti exists as His aisvarya non-different
from Him  as well just as sun and its heat are inseparable. Is that
right?

The essential nature of this Ishwara (jiva and jagat) is called
Brahman, beyond all philosophical constructs. Is that right?
