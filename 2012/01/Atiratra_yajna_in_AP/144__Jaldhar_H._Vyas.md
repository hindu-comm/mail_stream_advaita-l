Nowadays even for the scholars in Mimamsa and Karmakanda, the knowledge of 
Vedic yajnas is mainly theoretical.  However right up to this very day, 
there are some who have kept the flame of shrauta karma alive.

Please see The website http://www.athirathram2012.com/ which describes one 
such yajna which will take place in Andhra Pradesh.  However it seems it 
will be performed according to Keralan parampara by Nambudiri Brahmanas.
