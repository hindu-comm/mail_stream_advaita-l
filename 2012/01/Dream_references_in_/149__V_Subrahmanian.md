Namaste.

From the inputs provided by Shri P. Puttamane, a member in the
bharatiyavidvatparishad discussion group, by way of a large file, I have
selected some verses that talk about the unreality of dream
objects/events.  There are some verses that convey some other senses of
dreams too in this collection which is given as an attachment.

The highlight of this collection is this verse from the Mahabharatha:

महाभारतशान्तिपर्वम् अष्टविंशोऽध्यायः

स्वप्नलब्धा यथा लाभा वितथाः प्रतिबोधने ।

एवं ते क्षत्रिया राजन्ये व्यतीता महारणे ॥ ९ ॥

It would be significant to note that the word 'vitathAH' used with regard
to the (gains had in a) dream is reflected in the title: 'vaitathya
prakaraNam' of the   Mandukya kArikA of GaudapAda.  Here the very first
verse is:

वैतथ्यं सर्वभावानां स्वप्न आहुर्मनीषिणः ।
अन्तःस्थानात्तु भावानां संवृतत्वेन हेतुना ।।

From this it is clear that the Mahabharatha considers the dream phenomenon
as something that has unreal objects/events.
One can study the other verses too from the following collection from a
variety of works like the Valmiki Ramayana, adhyAtma Ramayana,
srImadbhAgavatham including the UddhavagitA and compare the usage of the
concept of dream with the usage found in Shankaracharya's works, a sample
from which too a few verses are shown in this collection.

I thank Shri Puttamane for the painstaking work in culling out verses
containing the word 'svapna' from various literary and scriptural works.
