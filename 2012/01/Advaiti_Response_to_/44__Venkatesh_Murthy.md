Namaste

Where Sruti is saying exactly Anitya=Mithya? The opponents may agree a
Pot is Anitya. It can be created and destroyed at some point. But how
is this proving it is Mithya? One point from Dvaiti side- the Advaiti
says something is Mithya but he says also looking from Paramartha that
Mithya thing was not there at any time. It becomes just like Asat.
Then how are you going to differentiate Mithya from Asat? If Mithya is
same as Asat we get a meaningless theory.
