With regard to dreams too Dvaitins admit of a 'bhrama' : 'jAgrattvabhrama
or bahiShThatvabhrama'.  During the dream experience one is under the
delusion that 'it is waking / the objects/events are outside'.  When waking
occurs this bhrama is contradicted, bAdhita.  Just like AsataH
Sattvaprateeti there is the 'bahiShThatva/jAgrattva prateeti' during a
dream experience.  In any case there is the delusion of the presence of
something that is actually not there.  The property of
'jAggratva/bahiShThatva' is absent but the person is deluded into thinking
that this property is present.  So the 'atasmin tadbuddhiH' definition of a
bhrama is applicable here too: जाग्रत्त्वाभाववति तस्मिन्
तत्सद्भावबुद्धिरूपभ्रमः ।

Supposing a father dreams that his dear son has died in an accident.  It no
doubt causes immense misery to him.  Upon waking is there not the natural
experience of relief to know that 'after all it was all a dream'? Where is
the 'reality' element here?  Will someone who is initiated into the
shAstra, upon waking from such a dream, not experience the relief? Will he
continue to feel miserable thinking 'dream object/event is real'?
