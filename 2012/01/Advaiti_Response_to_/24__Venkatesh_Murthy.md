' A protected monument is an evidence which cannot be denied so easily.
It is not strange on the part of an Advaitin to deny evidences when he
is denying the visible world itself.'

'Later Vidyamanyathirtha threw an open challenge. He announced that he
would present one lack Rupees to whoever establishes Advaita. Where
had your students or scholars or you had hidden at that time?'
