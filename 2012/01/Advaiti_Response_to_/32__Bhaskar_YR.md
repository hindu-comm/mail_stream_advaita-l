Hence paarmaarthika satyam is distinct from the vyaavahaarika satyam. Ring 
is different from Gold yet Ring is gold; all are in Me but factually none 
are in Me.

yes, without gold, we would not come to know that there is ring...This is 
gold (paramArtha) is eka rUpa never undergoes any change, hence qualified 
to be called as 'satyasya satya' (ekarUpeNa hi avasthitO yOrthaH sa 
paramArthaH says shankara in sUtra bhAshya.  So, the inherent nature of 
ring, bangle etc. is this gold which is 'eka rUpa' only nothing 
else...Even to catch these nAma rUpAtmaka jagat to do vyavahAra, the 
pAramArtika satya should be intrinsically there.  na hi nirAtmakaM kinchit 
bhUtaM vavahArAya avakalpate says shankara in geeta bhAshya. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
