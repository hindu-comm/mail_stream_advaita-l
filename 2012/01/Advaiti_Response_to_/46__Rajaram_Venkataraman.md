WOW! Is there an example of an object that can be said to be absolutely
real? What did not exist and will not exist does not exist now though it
appears to. However, if there is an example of an object that really
exists, I will transfer all my wealth to the one who is happy to sell it to
me. It is much more than the 1L that the Madhwa offered.
