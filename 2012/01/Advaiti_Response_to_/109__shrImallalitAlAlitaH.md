Don't quote name of anyone. Only test validity of views. Quoting by name is
not helpful for a healthy debate.

Obviously because challenge was posed and I want to test strength of my
views.
This is why your previous AchArya-s wrote works and debated.

This type of advice shows your anger only.
This is a public forum and we are testing various views to increase or test
our understanding. So, this advice is useless here.
You must say these words to your disciples or children and not to a
independent person.


> Infact, why should you bother about others.


Out of compassion or rage.
If I want to save shraddhA of advaitin-s, then first is the cause.
When I want to refute wrong view, second is used.

Same question applies to every AchArya of your tradition. Ask them. My
answer doesn't differ from theirs.

I definitely differ from your guru.
