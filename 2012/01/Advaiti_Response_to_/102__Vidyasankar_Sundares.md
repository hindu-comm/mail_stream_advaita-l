The short story is that there was no debate. Sri Vidyamanya Tirtha went to Sringeri,
looking for a debate with Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamigal, but was received
in a manner fitting for a visiting Mathadhipati and was gently pointed in the direction
of Sringeri Matha Pundits to have a debate. Briefly, the Sringeri Sankaracharya just
refused to be drawn into a debate according to terms set by someone spoiling for a
fight. That is all.

Vidyasankar
