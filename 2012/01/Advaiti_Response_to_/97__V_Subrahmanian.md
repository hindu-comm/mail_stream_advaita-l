Recently at the Tumkur Seminar I met Shri G.R.Patil of Dharwad who had
authored the Kannada Book (2005) on the above debate.  He told me that
there have been some exchanges on the topic between Dvaita scholars and
himself and the latest is a response from the Swamiji of the Akshobhya
Mutt.  I have sought the copies of all such correspondence and once I get
them and have studied them shall make a report on the same.

What to say to those who hold the dream objects/events to be as real as
waking objects/events?

Advaita had by then already been long established on unshakable terms by
the stalwarts of the tradition.  Scholars very well knew the 'outcome' of
such 'challenges'.  Let alone two opposing schools, even debates within the
school end up in situations coming close to exchanging blows in the run up
to the show of strength of the opposing viewpoints with no conclusion
emerging worth recording.  I have heard of such instances in Dvaita Mutts
on contentious issues like even Ekadashi thithi nirnaya.

As for the objection about 'sad-asad-vilakshana' it has to be remembered
that the Dvaita school need not look for any example outside its own school
than studying its own 'paratantra satya'.  For them the world and the jivas
are 'dependent realities' as distinct from the 'Independent reality,
'swatantra satya' Brahman.  In this two-level reality - स्वतन्त्रं
परतन्त्रं च द्विविधं तत्तवमिष्यते । (तत्तवसङ्ख्यान),  द्विविधं हि प्रमेयं
स्वतन्त्रं परतन्त्रं च । (न्यायसुधा) - scheme of theirs the former
(dependent reality) has no existence of its own except the borrowed
existence from the latter (Brahman).  No analogy for such an entity is apt
than the rope-snake/shell-silver type. स्वसत्ताशून्यत्वे सति
अन्यसत्ताधीनसत्ताकत्वं परतन्त्रस्य।
