Why do you say Mayavada is derogatory? Sri Gaudapadaacharya, the grand
guru of Adi Shankara, the student of Sri Shuka, himself consolidated
the doctrine of Mayavada. Sri Shuka himself is the author of the
Bhagavata purana which is the most important scripture for vaishnavas.
Terming the work of Shuka's student as "degradatory" is the same as
calling the Bhagavata derogatory and calling Sri Krshna derogatory.
Its the dvaiti who is making a fool out of himself not the advaiti.
