It does not take much time and effort for the Advaitin to reply to the
above:

In Vedanta satkAryavAda though the effect, before manifesting, is held to
be in the cause AS the cause, still even at that state it is mithyA only as
it remains non-different from the cause.  This is the same with the
post-destruction state too.  कालत्रय्ऽपि कार्यं कारणादनन्यतया एव वर्तते .
At all the three periods the effect can never be separately shown from the
cause.  Just as we say the effect is nothing but a name/word in the
manifest state so too the effect even in the pre-manifestation state is
only a word/name.

This applies to the world as well.

before manifestation or after, the effect is mithyA alone.'
