If there were
nothing but silence, it wouldn't
exist for you; you wouldn't know
what it is. Only when sound
appears does silence come into
being. Similarly, if there were only
space without any objects in
space, it wouldn't exist for you.
Imagine yourself as a point of
consciousness floating in the
vastness of space - no stars, no
galaxies, just emptiness. Suddenly,
space wouldn't be vast anymore; it
would not be there at all. There
would be no speed, no movement
from here to there. At least two
points of reference are needed for
distance and space to come into
being. Space comes into being the
moment the One becomes two,
and as "two" become the "ten
thousand things.
But it is always the one that is the source of many.
So to prove the existence of Brahman alone it is necessary to prove
the non-existence of Maya.
Only when a disciple is crystal clear of the notion of non-dual
Brahman, he no longer tilts towards the maya aspect. Hence, Mayavada
is required atleast in the beginning if not in the entire process.
Sadly dvaitins waste their time debating the nature of Maya which
triggers such unwanted debates.
