Namaste

This explanation of Satkaryavada you have given is conflicting with
Vacarambhana Sruti. If the Effect Pot is Mithya before creation and
after destruction why is this Sruti teaching us Knowing Clay we can
know Pot. What is there to know if Pot is Mithya? The Sruti becomes
useless. It becomes wrong also because it is teaching Knowing a real
Thing like Brahman is same as Knowing a Mithya thing. This is
impossible.  The way to explain things is there is no Absolute Non
Existence of any thing any time.  Everything is existing in some
condition always. There is no Nasha of any thing.

The Sruti is teaching us there is no destruction of any thing because
Brahman is the Material Cause of Everything and Brahman cannot be
destroyed. The Pot cannot be destroyed because it will become Clay and
even that Clay is Brahman only. The Vacarambhana Sruti is teaching us
Any thing is a transformation Vikara of Brahman with a Name and the
Name is got from Words. Vacarambhanam Vikaro Namadheyam.
