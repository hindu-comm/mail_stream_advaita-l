Sruti may be saying Pot, Tumbler etc are all Clay material only
really. Correct? But how is it making Pot and Tumbler Mithya? The
Satyam word is saying the Vakya 'The Clay articles like Pot are Clay'
is true. See Ranga Ramanuja Bhashya-
मृन्मयं घटादिकं मृत्तिकेत्येव प्रमाणप्रतिपन्नम् । न तु तद्भिनत्वेन
इत्यर्थः । यद्वा मृन्मयं मृत्तिकेति वाक्यमेव सत्यं
अबाधितार्थकमित्यर्थः ।

The Vacarambana Sruti has said the Upadana of World is Brahman. But
how does it make the World Mithya? If Sruti is saying Brahman is
Upadana of World and World is false the whole Vacarambhana Sruti will
become useless. It is correct to speak of Upadana of something real
only. What is the point in saying Upadana of Mithya thing?  Ekam Eva
Advitiyam is there also. True. Then we can say Brahman is Main reality
and the World is depending on Brahman and it is also Brahman material
only. Without Brahman the World is not there. But it is wrong to say
the World is Mithya.
