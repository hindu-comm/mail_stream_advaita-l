Namaste,

///

There are some reasons to doubt that the debate between Sri Vidyaranya
and Akshobhyathirtha has taken place. One of them is given in the
following website itself -

//

Shri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamigal had personally disapproved this incident which according to His Holiness is a fabricated story by madhva scholars who had grudge 
against Sringeri Amnaya Pitha. 

But Sringeri Pitha, per se, doesn't have any grudges against anybody and welcome all the acharyas with love and affection. This single gesture is enough to prove the compassion of sringeri acharya parampara. 

Shri Swamigal also personally adviced not to engage in ku-tarka with madhvas to establish the supremacy of advaita because advaita is such a high philosophy which cannot be understood from vyavaharika level. It is an anubhuti. 

regs,
sriram
