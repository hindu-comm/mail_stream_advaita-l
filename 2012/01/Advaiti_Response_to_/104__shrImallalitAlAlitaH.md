I don't think this is a good advice.
If advaita is a philosophy, then it must be vyAvahArika. So, it's
apprehension must occur on the same level.
If you can't understand a philosophy, then how could you go on supporting
it.
And what is this anubhUti thing ? You say advaita a philosophy and then
call it anubhUti. Don't you think you are messing up things and confusing
others?

The correct advice should be:
Those who don't have qualification, must not engage in debates to save
their shraddhA.
Those who have must go for it if suitable environment is available.
