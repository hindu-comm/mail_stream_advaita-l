Namaste Venkatesh-ji

> But Advaitis are caught up in Mayavada only insted of Sadvada.


Mayavada is generally used as a derogatory term by dvaitins and others
against advaita. The real spirit of advaita is brahmavada, not
mayavada. You will be doing a great disservice to advaita by calling
it as mayavada. Yes, nothing is ever born or destroyed, because when
eveything is brahman, the question of birth or death does not arise.
This is brahmavada in its purest form. When you worship brahman in
saguna form, like narayana or siva or sakti, the same priciple of
brahmavada (seeing siva or narayana or sakti everywhere) will also
lead you to the highest form of bhakti. That is why we have stalwarts
like madhusudhana saraswati who are both advaitins and krishna-bhaktas
at the same time. That is why Sri Sankara was able to compose both
devotional works as well as works imparting jnana at the same time. I
regret your fundamental misunderstanding of advaita.


Regards

Kalyan
