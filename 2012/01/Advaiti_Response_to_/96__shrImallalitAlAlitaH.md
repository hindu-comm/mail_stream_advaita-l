What do you understand by word true ? What is called false ?
It is possible that our definitions differ and that may be impelling you to
say that neither true nor false things don't exist.
According to our definitions such things exist. Those definitions could be
found in advaita-siddhiH, etc.

After determining definition of mithyAtvam it will be easy for you to
accept your relatives mithyA. That will come later. Let you first declare
your definitions.
And remember, we don't say that anityatvam is mithyAtvam. We say that
anityatvam is cause of mithyAtvam.

Leave words which only aim to insult. We are not here to play that game.
Say only those words which prove their view correct or ours' wrong.

The Jiva goes through  three states. But a dream object is also real.

Wow !!!
Amazing is their view. Ask them to bring some water with a pot seen in
dream.
