Venkatesha Murthy - PraNams

Fundamental problem as is evident in these criticisms is not appreciating mithyaa aspect of the world - which constitutes neither real nor unreal. For both dvita and vishiShTaadvaita sat and asat are mutually exclusive and there is nothing what is neither sat nor asat. Ninety percent of their criticisms are centered on this - In Advaita Siddhi Shree Madhusudana discusses five definitions of falsity that were provided by advaita aachaaryas. 

It is difficult for them to understand that very negation of advaita is negation of the negator himself. No proof is needed for self-existence and self alone exists is evident in the deep sleep state. Mantra 7 of Mandukya has to be understood. Will be understood if not in this life, in the next life.The rest is suShka vaadas only - just waste of time.

Hari Om!
Sadananda

' A protected monument is an evidence which cannot be denied so easily.
It is not strange on the part of an Advaitin to deny evidences when he
is denying the visible world itself.'

'Later Vidyamanyathirtha threw an open challenge. He announced that he
would present one lack Rupees to whoever establishes Advaita. Where
had your students or scholars or you had hidden at that time?'
