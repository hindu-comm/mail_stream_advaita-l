Look, you have been asked to explain or define what you understand by the
words satya and asatya.

You have also been told by another member that you misunderstand what is 
meant by the word mithyA.

If you care to have a meaningful discussion, please address these two points
first. Otherwise, your tone of exaggerated complaint, quoting Rangaramanuja
bhAshya here, mAdhva bhAshya there, will not inspire any serious response
from other members of this list. In general, the frequent contributors to this
list's discussions are a very patient lot. Please do not abuse their kindness. I
am saying this in my capacity as a moderator of this list.

Returning to general member mode, I notice that you have ignored a number
of other points made by Sri Subrahmanian, Sri Lalitalalitah, Sri Praveen Bhat,
Sri Sadananda and myself. Do take some time to assimilate those and see if
you have anything to add to what you have already said.
