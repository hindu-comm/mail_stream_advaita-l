I wonder if whoever wrote that believes in sunrise or sunset?  I hope that 
anyone with a modicum of education realizes that the sun does not actually 
rise or set.  In fact it is the Earth which is orbiting the Sun.  But this 
is "denying the visible world itself" is it not?  Once our Vaishnava 
champion understands how we can talk about e.g. "perform sandhyavandana at 
sunrise." and yet understand the higher truth of astronomy, he will begin 
to understand why "an advaitin...is denying the visible world itself." is 
a very silly thing to say.
