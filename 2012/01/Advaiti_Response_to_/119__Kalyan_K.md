Namaste Rajaramji,

With all due respect, I do not think that the purpose of this list is to
produce modern day Ramanujas or Madhwas. If this list were a free-for-all,
there would be nothing but cacophony. And cacophony produces only heat and
sound but no light. I therefore feel that the moderator has done the right
thing by trying to stop this.

Regards
Kalyan
