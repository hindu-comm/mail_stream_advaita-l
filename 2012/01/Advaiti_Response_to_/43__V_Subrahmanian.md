The 'eva' along with 'vAchArambhaNam vikAro nAmadheyam' is enough teaching
in the shruti for the Advaitin's conclusion/interpretation.  The
characteristic of anityatva is: it has a beginning and an end.  The
scripture based on yukti teaches that 'that which is absent before
beginning and after end has to be deemed to be so (absent) even in the
intervening period.  So it is not a 'jump' from anityatva to mithyAtva but
only stating that anityatva IS mithyAtva/asatyatva.

Transformation is nothing but giving the clay a new name and form which
were not there before and will not be after.  Hence mithyAtva of the
name-form transformed-clay is the natural conclusion.

Pl. read an earlier post on the above here:

The purpose of the shruti in giving the three analogies is to enable the
knowledge of the 'essence' / 'truth' of the phenomenon called the
variegated world.  To know that the created world has no existence/reality
apart from the material cause, Sat, is not a waste.  That indeed is the
liberating knowledge.

Only because of these disagreements we have different schools.
