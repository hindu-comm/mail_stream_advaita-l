Sorry, nobody here is asking you to show darkness, but asking you what
your definition of darkness is to say that there is nothing called
darkness.

Agreed, but you're not trying to say this. Not until now!

You've thoroughly managed to confuse yourself as to not only what
mithyA is, etc, but also as to whom are the scriptures useful. The
j~nAni has no use for the scriptures, so your argument as to what he
sees is completely unnecessary. Now, lets for your own sake use your
terminology of manda buddhi and what he sees. Why is he seeing a pot
when j~nAni is seeing clay? This contradicts with your own statement
earlier that pot is also real. If clay that j~nAni sees is real and
the pot is also real, then why is the one who sees that real pot even
manda buddhi?! Surely, there is something different between the
so-called realities of clay and pot. If there is none, then why would
you call one a j~nAni and another manda? If there is a difference in
these realities, then that is what mithyAvAda explains.
