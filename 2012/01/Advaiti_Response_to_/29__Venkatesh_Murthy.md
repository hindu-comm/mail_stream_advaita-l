Where is Sruti saying Maya and Brahma is like foam and water?

What is problem to say Satya can also be cycle type change?. The world
is changing but it is a cycle.

If world is like snake in a Brahman rope there is a problem. Who is
seeing the snake? You cannot say I am seeing it because you are also
Brahman only. You are saying world is also Brahman only. Then Brahman
is seeing Brahman as snake in Brahman as rope. This is  meaningless.

Why is not possible for Satya to be cycle type Satya? Change is there
but it is a cycle.
