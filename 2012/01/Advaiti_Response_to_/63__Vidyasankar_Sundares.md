Not to fast. Again, again and yet again, you prove to this list that you don'tunderstand the first thing about the upanishads and advaita vedAnta. "We
have to change"??? Who gave you the authority to change anything?
You are apparently not aware of the usage of the word mriyate, right afterjAyate, in three verses of the gauDapAda kArikA.
Need I remind you of the gItA verses that say jAtasya hi dhruvo mRtyuH and
na jAyate mriyate vA kadAcit? That which is born has an end. That which
is never born can never end. It would be superfluous after a point to keep
mentioning this, for gauDapAda. If you think you've just had a major insight,
think again.
Therefore, before you get on your bandwagon and claim to be a betterphilosopher about sat and asat than gauDapAda and SankarAcArya, read 
the prasthAna trayI first, preferably under the guidance of a good paNDita,
then assimilate it all at a fundamental level (at least try to) and then get
back us with something that makes a modicum of sense. Sorry, you leave
me no choice but to be harsh, yet again, in responding to you.
That said, I am now going to put on my list moderator hat. On Tuesday,
Jan 17, this thread ends. I am giving you fair notice instead of declaring it
closed right now. Do not continue this thread after that time. I request other
list members who may have anything to add, to do so within the next day.
