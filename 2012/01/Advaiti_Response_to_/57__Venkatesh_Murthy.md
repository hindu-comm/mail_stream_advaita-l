Namaste Sri Praveen

When there is bright light everywhere you are asking me to show and
describe Darkness. Kindly tell me how this is relevant. When
everything is Sat where is the scope for Asat and Mithya? I don't have
to define Asat and Mithya because they are never experienced. Even in
shell silver illusion silver is Sat only and shell is also Sat. The
base of everything in the world is Sat only. Even the dream object has
the base Sat. So it is Sat only. You are Sat and I am Sat. There is
Sat everywhere.

The pure Sadvada is the Upanishadic thought like 'Ekam Sat Bahudha
Vadanti', 'Sadeva Somya Idam Agra Asit Ekam Eva Advitiyam', 'Sarvam
Khalvidam Brahma', 'Antarbahishca Tatsarvam Vyapya Narayanaha
Sthitaha".

Tell me one place where there is no Brahman. This is how
Hiranyakashipu asked the boy Prahlada. He said Everywhere. Even the
non living Pillar. He broke it to see and inside there was Narasimha.
This shows Brahman is there in everything. That is Sat is there in
everything.
