Puranas have said there is Kruta Yuga Treta Yuga Dwapara Yuga and Kali
Yuga and again Kruta Yuga Treta Yuga... This cycle is repeating for
ever. Where is said the cycle is Mithya? Everyday in Sankalpa we say
the Tithi Nakshatra, Yoga, Karana and others but it is also in the
same cycle. Where is the Mithyatva here? This same Khara Nama
Samvatsara Pausha Masa will come again and again and the other things
like Vaivasvata Manvantara Ashtavimshatitama Kali Yuga will come again
and again. How this will become Mithya? The World is the Repeating
Reality. But we cannot call it as Mithya.

If you are saying the Changing Repeating Reality is less than
Unchanging Satya why? But you are agreeing Changing Reality is not
False. Why can't you call Changing Reality as Dependent Reality
Paratantra and Unchanging Reality as Independent Reality Swatantra.
Then you are agreeing with Dvaitins to some extent.
