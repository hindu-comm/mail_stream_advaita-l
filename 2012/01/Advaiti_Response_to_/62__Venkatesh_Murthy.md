The Pillar had to be broken. But who broke it? A Demon broke it. But
Prahlada did not have to break it. He was seeing Narayana only
everywhere. Like this a man with right knowledge will see Sat
everywhere. You cannot teach Maya priniciple to him. It is unnecessary
confusing and complicated to talk Maya.

This may be done to start studies. But the advanced student will not
need Neti Neti if he has realized Sat is everywhere.

Brahmavada is the highest teaching. They may use Mayavada for starting
students. Because they are not interested in seeing the same Sat
everywhere.  For them Sruti is saying Neti Neti.  If he is convinced
there is only Sat why confuse him with Maya?

But you can see in any Advaita text more than 80% is Mayavada. Why?
This is not correct.
