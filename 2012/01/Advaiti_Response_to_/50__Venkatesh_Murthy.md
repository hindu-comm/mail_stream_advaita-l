With this point I am replying to above and also now replying to your
other important point- if a thing is existing in the middle but not
before and after it is not existing any time. These two points are
replied in this way by Ramanuja and his followers. Why do you say a
pot is not existing before it is created? We don't agree. There is no
absolute nonexistence for any thing. If you say Pot was not existing
before we say it was existing as Clay. This is Satkaryavada. The
Effect Pot is Existing in Cause Clay. It is accepted by Advaitis also.
If you say Pot is destroyed some time and it is again non existing. We
say no. Even when it is destroyed it is existing as Clay. There is no
time when Pot did not exist. This same is true for World also. The
Brahman is Upadana Cause. The World is Effect. The World is always
Existing. First it is in Brahman then it is created and when it is
destroyed also it is Brahman only. In this argument there is no need
for Mithyatva any where. Why assume Mithyatva if we can explain it
like this?
