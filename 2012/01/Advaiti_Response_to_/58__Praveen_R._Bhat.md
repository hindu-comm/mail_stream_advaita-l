I'm asking you to describe darkness because you're saying there is nothing
like darkness. To say there is nothing like darkness, you should know what
darkness is. If you don't know what it is, then there is no meaning in
saying there is no darkness either.

I hope the above clarifies the relevance.

Well, then explain why while being clay, there is appearance of pot at all?
If pot is truth, clay is truth, then why pot is visible at all because
there can't be two/multiple truths. Why doesn't everyone see clay, clay and
clay everywhere?

Either you have to believe in advaita vedanta as there is only one sat and
that appears differently or you have to say that there are multiple sats,
else it will mean silver = truth = shell. Silver = shell is the result,
which is completely meaningless.

With the above, dream = sat = waking. Dream = waking. Either say that or
explain the difference between pot and clay, silver and shell, dream and
waking. All can't be the same, else going even further, the argument will
also lead to pot = dream = silver = clay = shell = waking, because all are
truth. :) No matter how you approach this discussion, all being sat still
appears differently, else you can't even use terminology such as
shell-silver *illusion* which you very well use.

Ekam sat would have been sufficient for Upanishadic though, that viprAH
bahudA vadanti is completely out of place, except for mithyA! The bahudA
would have no existence, let alone for viprAh's vadanti. :)

sarvam is out of place, but for mithyA.

Why does Narayana stithaH all alone become antar & bAhya; its out of place,
but for mithyA.

"Every"thing is out of place, except for mithyA.
