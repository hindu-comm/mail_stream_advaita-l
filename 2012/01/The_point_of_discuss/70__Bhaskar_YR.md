Shutting down a thread stiffles expression and continuing the thread 
without a genuine
dialogue is pointless.

Yes, I too surprised to see Sri Vidya prabhuji's sudden decision on this 
issue.  But I am sure he always does the right thing at the right time. 
But oflate, I could see some point in Sri Venkatesh prabhuji's argument. 
Basically he is asking us, when we say brahman is the abhinnanimittOpadAna 
kAraNa of this jagat and shruti says there is nothing 'apart' from brahman 
(sarvaM khalvidaM brahma)why we should say jagat (nAma rUpa)  is mithya?? 
Can we answer his queries keeping this point of view in mind??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
