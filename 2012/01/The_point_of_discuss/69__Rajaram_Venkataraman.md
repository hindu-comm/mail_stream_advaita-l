Rajaram: I agree that I cannot generalize. It is perhaps possible that one
understands but does not agree with the conclusions of advaita. Regarding
moderation, I agree there should be a different tactic. Shutting down a
thread stiffles expression and continuing the thread without a genuine
dialogue is pointless. The middle option is to state one's conclusions
and remain silent so that Sri Venkatesh (in this case) gets time to
assimilate others' posts and/or exchange a mail with him privately.
