You are painting a whole lot of people with a very broad brush.  Some do, 
some don't.  Now in this case the the thread has reached 60+ messages.  If 
one has not yet gotten the message, what makes you think another 60 will 
do the trick?  It's a signal a different tack has to be taken don't you 
think?

Sure if clarification is needed it will be given.  I am not suggesting we 
shut down any criticism of Advaita altogether.  However, one has to keep 
in mind what the goal of vada is supposed to be.  Advaita Vedanta has a 
definite structure and dogma yes.  Too often this is forgotten or 
foolishly ignored.  But at the same time it cannot be ignored that the 
final goal of this shastra is to jettison all that.  The purpose of 
arguments internal and with external opponents is to aid in an inner 
transformation that leads to jnana.  If this is not happening then it only 
futile sophistry and I for one have more pressing demands on my time.
