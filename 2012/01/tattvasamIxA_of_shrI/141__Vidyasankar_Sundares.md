SankhapANi is the name of the commentator who wrote a TIkA on brahmasiddhi.
The edition by Sri Kuppuswami Sastri is a very good critical edition, taking into
account readings from multiple manuscripts and commentaries. The introduction
to this edition, written by Sri P. P. Subrahmanya Sastri, is also a must-read.

The tattva-samIkshA of vAcaspati miSra is available only partially. It was long
thought to be "lost" and was only known through quotations in other works. Its
recent discovery and publication mark a milestone in advaita vedAnta literature.
Credit must go to the Nepalese German manuscript preservation and cataloging
projects conducted by the government of Nepal and university of Hamburg, out
of which a number of publications of rare works have seen the light of day.
