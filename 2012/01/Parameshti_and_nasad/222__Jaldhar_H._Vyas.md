ParameShTi in the bhAShyas and anukramaNikAs (the vedA~Nga dealing with the 
R^iShis, Devatas, and chhandas of each mantra) refers to prajApati (i.e. 
brahma) not paramAtma.

The nAsadIya sUkta is usually presented as the textbook example of a 
purported Vedic agnosticism.  "Who knows and who can say it?" But kA is 
also a name of Brahma.  "Brahma knows and Brahma can say it." puts a 
completely different spin on it.
