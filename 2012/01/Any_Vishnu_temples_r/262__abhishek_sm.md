Sri Guru Narasimha temple of Saligrama town, Udupi district is managed
by Koota Brahmins, i.e a form of Smartha brahmins. The most
interesting fact is that, instead of considering Adi Shankara as their
guru, they consider Lord Narayana in the form of GURU Narasimha as
their guru. Adi Shankara is considered only a proponent. Still, they
follow Advaita vedanta. The temple is said to be over 1500 years old,
while the deity is said to be of unknown times. The deity is a 3 ft
tall vigraha of Narasimha carved out of the Saligrama stone on its
own! It is believed to be self manifested.
