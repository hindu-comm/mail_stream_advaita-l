Namaste

Pavagada Prakash Rao is a great Smartha scholar. Facebook page -

He has given TV lectures regularly in Gita and other topics.

In one lecture he said in Vedic period they worshipped Gods with
Yajnas only. Gods are pleased with Havis offered in Agni. There was no
temple and idol worship. Temple worship is more recent in Hinduism. If
they had continued only Yajnas as worship there could not have been
looting of temples and Hindu wealth by Mlecchas and devil worshippers.

Vaikhanasa followers probably started temple worship.
