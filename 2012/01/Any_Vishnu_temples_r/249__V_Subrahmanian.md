I think we can cite the Guruvayurappan at Guruvayur, Kerala.  The worship
services are performed by Nambudiris who are not considered Vaishnavas as
far as I know.

And what about Ayyappan Temple, Sabarimala?  The deity can be considered
'Vaishnava' though He is said to be Hari-Hara putran.  He is seen with the
'UrdhvapuNDram' on His forehead though vibhuti abhiShekam is also a
favourite of His.

The famous Ananthapadmanabhaswamy Temple at Tiruvananthapuram is one more
instance where worship is by Nambuthiris.

TiruvaTTAru is a 'divya desham' important for Srivaishnavas in Tamilnadu
where Nambudiris do the puja.

I understand from a Srivaishnava friend that there are some 11 divya desha
temples in Kerala where Nambudiris do the puja.

Of course, in the North, the famous Badrinarayan Temple is another one
where Nambudiris do the puja.
