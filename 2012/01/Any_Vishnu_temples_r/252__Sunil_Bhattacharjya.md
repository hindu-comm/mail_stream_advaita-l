It is a pity that many Hindus forgot the Upanishadic message "Vishnu's heart is Shiva and Shiva's heart is Vishnu".

Yes. This is true. Even in Bangalore, Melkote, etc. I have seen that the
archakas in Vishnu Temples are Vaikhanasas. Yet I think they are in the
broad group of Vaishnavas. That way even in Shiva Temples, at least in
Tamilnadu, I think the majority of the archakas are from the 'GurukkaL'
community. In Chidamabaram they are 'Dikshitars'. Generally the smarthas
do not 'mix' with them by striking matrimonial alliances, shrAddha, etc. I
also feel this is the same case with srivaishnavas and the Agamikas
(vaikhanasas) though I know of exceptions in the case of Varadarajaswamy
Temple at Kanchi. I also think the Vadagalai, Tenkalai differences exist
among vaikhanasas too. Just like the archakas in Vishnu Temple are
Agamikas, maybe the Nambudiris too have a sub-sect among them which is
given to temple archaka profession. It is known that there are close to a
dozen groups among Nambudiris divided function-wise. How far these
divisions are valid in the present day is another question. In Karnataka
smarthas, however, I have not seen the (saiva)Agama/smartha difference
among archaka-non-archaka groups.
