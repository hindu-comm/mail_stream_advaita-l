Kalyanji,

There is a place called "Annavaram" in East Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh.
This is nearby Kakinada. This place is famous for "Satyanarayna Swamy Temple"
and is popularly known as Annavaram Satyadeva. Everyday, sAmuhika satyanarayana
vratams are performed on large scale.

The temple has 2 floors. The ground floor consists of large yantrawhich is based
on the bija mantras of "Tripad Vibhuti Mahanarayana Upanishad". Worship is done
to this yantra only. At the bindu sthAna, a large pillar standsout projected till the
2nd floor. On the top of this pillar, ramA-sahita satyanArAyaNa swamy is installed
alongwith hiraNyagarbha. But to have the darshan of this beautiful idol, we need 
to climb to 2nd floor only. 

The satyanArAyaNa bestows His grace through the nArAyaNa yantra which is at the 
basement cell. 

The worship is done as per the smArta paddhati only. Here the kSEtra pAlaka is 
"kOdaNDa rAma".

regs,
sriram
