Sunilji, rest assured that this discussion will not go the way of vishnu vs
shiva. Such discussions are childish. After all, veda says "ekam sat
vipraah bahudhaa vadanti" (truth is one, wise men call it by different
names). The intent of my post was to have a discussion on temples and their
practices. It is not a discussion about which god is better. Hope that
clarifies things.

Regards
Kalyan
