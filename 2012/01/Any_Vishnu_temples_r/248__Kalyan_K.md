Dear members,

I notice that most of the Vishnu temples in South India are run by either
Sri Vaisnavas or Madhwas. Temples like Tirupati, Srirangam, Simhachalam,
Bhadrachalam, Udupi are all run by Vaishnavas. Are there any major Vishnu
(or his avatar) temples in South India, that are run by smartas? If so, can
some one please list them?

Regards
Kalyan
