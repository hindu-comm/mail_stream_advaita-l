The Bull temple located in Basavana Gudi, Bull temple road, Bangalore
was constructed by Vijayanagara rulers in the15th century. The nandi
is carved out of a huge monolithic rock which has blackened over time.
The temple is located over a hill and is quite large. Kempegowda, the
founder of Bangalore is supposed to have brought innovations to the
temple. Nandi himself is the chief deity.
