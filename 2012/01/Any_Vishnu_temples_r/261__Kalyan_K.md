Dear Sri Venkat,


>There is a place called "Annavaram" in East Godavari District of Andhra
Pradesh.
>This is nearby Kakinada.  This place is famous for "Satyanarayna Swamy
Temple"
>and is popularly known as Annavaram Satyadeva.  Everyday, sAmuhika
satyanarayana
>vratams are performed on large scale.

I have heard of this place as I hail from AP myself, though I did not
visit it. Just curious, is the deity considered to be self-manifested here?


>The temple has 2 floors.  The ground floor consists of large yantra which
is based
> on the bija mantras of "Tripad Vibhuti Mahanarayana Upanishad".

Talking of yantras, there is a legend that SrI Adi Sankara established a
yantra at tirupati. However, I cannot vouch for the authenticity of this
legend.


Regards
Kalyan
