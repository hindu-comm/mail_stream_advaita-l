IMHO,
In general Smartha Braahmanas do not work as temple archakas. I am a Sankethi Braahmana and there are Sankethi Vadhyars but rarely any temple archakas.

What was said in a prior post, Nambudiri Braahmanas are not exactly Smaarthas. Apparently they don't have a sampradaya. Unlike Iyers who are Smaarthas and Iyengars who are Sri Vaishnavas.
