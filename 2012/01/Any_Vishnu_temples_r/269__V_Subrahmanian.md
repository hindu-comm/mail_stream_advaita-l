That is not uncommon here in Bangalore.  In fact the above scholar has
discoursed in the Sringeri Shankara Mutt Hall in the past.  Recently I was
surprised to see a huge picture of Shankaracharya at the Purnaprajna
Vidyapeetha (Madhwa) institution here.  On closer look I found that it was
a banner announcing a Bhagavatam discourse program by Vidwan Haridasa
Bhattacharya of this school.  The program was arranged by 'Sri
Shankaracharya Seva Samiti' at another venue.

I have mentioned in this forum before about Dr.A.V.Nagasampige, Director of
the Purnaprajna Samshodhana Mandiram, delivering a talk on 'The Three
Acharyas' at the Mandiram avenue and also at Sringeri Mutt premises.
