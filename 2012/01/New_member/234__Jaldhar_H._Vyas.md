Since 11 year i manage a school for hatha and raja yoga in the center of 
Berlin, Germany, "www.raum-fuer-yoga.de".

After studying samskrit for 4 years at Berlin Universities i translated 
the "tattva bodha" and "atma bodha" of shrii shankaracarya and the "yoga 
sutra" of patanjali from samskrit to german language.

Since 2 year we maintain a philosophy course with topics mostly about 
advaita vedanta. There we studied these texts and currently we study the 
panchadashi.
