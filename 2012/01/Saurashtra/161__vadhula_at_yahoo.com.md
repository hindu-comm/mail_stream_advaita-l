Sourashtrian Brahmins of TN perform upanayana, etc and have similar gotras. Many have Iyer and Iyengar surnames. Some are purohits and are veg. But many are non-veg. An anomaly is that are silk weavers. IMHO, many jaathis in South India that are weavers that belong to Vaishya or Shudra varna. Their language also has adopted words from Marathi,Telugu,and Tamil. Muslim invasion of Gujarat may caused migration down South.

For a start there were some 202 of them (out of the 500+ in all India) but nearly all only came into existence after the breakup of the Mughal empire and the sultanate of Ahmedabad and the word Saurashtra is much older than that. I have been told 2 etymologies, from Su + rashtra "the good country" or from Saura + rashtra "the country of the sun worshippers."  The area has a higher number of Surya mandirs[1] than other parts of India and the Saura influence is an important part of the local culture.  For instance our kuladevi Randala Ma is the wife of Surya Bhagawan.

Dave.[2]  In it he correlates many words of the Saurashtrian dialect with medieval Gujarati forms and therefore considers the idea of northern origin plausible.  I believe he also mentioned that the status of those Saurashtrians as Brahmanas was only settled in a series of court cases in the 19th century so more likely they are a community sui generis.
