In an offline chat, Sri Subrahmanian explained how Sankara comments Ch. Up.
verses on singing etc. for liberated as metaphorical and the description of
jivan mukta Indra and Devas. I woul like to challenge it to get to bottom
of it in terms of understanding. How is such an indirect interpretation
justified? If upanishads teach that our svarupa in mukti is to relish with
Ishwara and other Jivas, how can Sankara explain it away to fit advaita?
Thanks in advance.
