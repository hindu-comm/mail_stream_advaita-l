So, if you argue that a jiva also can have a body on those lines, then the

> RV: 1. Even when an avatara ends Ishwara continues to exist. The Krishna
tells Arjuna that many lives have passed for us which you have forgotten
but not me. Manifesting many forms within (child, youth etc.) and between
avataras (rama, krishna etc.) does not affect His state. The same is
possible or a mukta jiva also? If it is said tt this form is still
different from the Lord, the difference between Vishnu and His form is not
admitted by Madhusudana (Rahu's head). 2. What is the scriptural basis to
say avatar has prarabda karma? Kanchi Periyava says there is no body due to
karma for avatara. So, there seems to be two ways within the sampradaya.

RV: If you replace anirvachanIya with achintya, it souds like achintya
bhedAbheda of gaudiyas.  What is the scriptural basis to say that Brahman
is devoid of all shaktis?
