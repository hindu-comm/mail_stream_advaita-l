I had a specific modern group in mind when I used the word 'naive'.
You know what that group is.

As far as rAmAnuja or mAdhva are concerned, they were mahApuruSha-s in
their own way but their idea of bandha & mukti is different from that
of the advaitin-s. As far as advaita-vedAnta is concerned, a bheda is
a limitation and a mukti with limitations is no mukti at all.

The above is one of the "first principles" to be appreciated in order
to understand advaita. Other traditions have a different view of
bandha and so their view of mukti is different as well.

<<it is a fair question in my view to ask why Sankara says a mukta
does not act.>>

Because, from the first principles of advaita-vedAnta, it does not
make sense to talk of a mukta who "really" acts.

As an aside, one of the points on which most if not all Hindu
traditions agree is that a mukta transcends kartR^itvam. Of course,
their explanations differ.
