RV: For an enlightened one in Advaitam, there is no other and no desire.
So, how it possible to materialise either for himself or the other? There
is no matter also.

RV: Ishwara, in Advaita, does not have body or mind. But he is able to
manifest the entire jagat. The body of the Ishwara during an avatara or
svatambu is not due to any karma. So, it is possible to have a body that is
not dependent on karma. And it is possible to act without a body.

RV: .  This enjoyment is not with 72 virgins. It is participation in the
divine Krishna Lila (janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah..).

Even atmaramas are attracted to Hari. This is admitted by Sridhara Swami
and Madhusudana. Even Sadasiva Brahmendral and Bhogendral relished Krishna
and Rama Lila

RV: Why? The Lord does not have any other person  but enjoys. Even in
loukika, we say "I enjoyed myself". Hari Himself appears as Gopis, Vyasa,
Suka, Narada etc. as stated in SBh last chapter.

RV: There is no duality between shakti and shaktimaan. The Lord and His
pure devotees are one.

RV: But as nothing really exists, the statement  everything is him becomes
nothing in him.
