factor between Ishwara and Jivas or two Jivas. The conflict of interest
between Ishwara and Jiva does not arise if the latter desires as per the
will of the former.

RV: From all these, we can only say that it is Vishnu's maya. If some one
says that Sri Subrahmanian analyses philosophy well with his sharp
intelligence and vast learning, will it be appropriate to conclude that Sri
Subrahmanian is by nature devoid of intelligence and learning? Or that he
is intelligent only when he is analysing philosophy (tatastha lakshana) not
otherwise?
