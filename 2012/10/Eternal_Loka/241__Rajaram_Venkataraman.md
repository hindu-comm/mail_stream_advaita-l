Dear Sri Vidyasankar,

In SBh 1.5.12, Kadalangudi Sastrigal translates that atma jnanam does not
look well when devoid of devotion to the supreme lord. In SBh 3.29.13, it
is clearly said that a pure devotee does not want any kind of liberation
including ekatvam. A similar view is expressed in SBh 4.9.29. In SBh
2.3.10, three kinds of devotes are talked about. One who is free from all
desires, one who has all desires and one who has desire for liberation. So,
it is not that there are only devotees with desires in the material world
and devotees who want to get out of it.There are akama bhaktas who perform
devotion only because of attraction to the lord. We may not have that kind
of devotion but cannot say that it does not exist.

I don't think Bhakti needs bheda bhava as you say. Madhusudana says that
the highest devotee is one who knows I am He. Even in gaudiya school,
Baladeva talks about Gopalaham as a form of devotion. Sridhara, in his
introduction to BhavArthadIpikA talks about devotion between Siva and
Vishnu, who are one.  Please read Prof. lance Nelson's thesis on Bhakti
Rasayana. He describes how Madhusudana not only considers Bhakti to be
paramapurushartha but also why it is eternal. Of course, he concludes that
Madhusudana was more a devotee than an advaitin and could not reconcile
Bhakti and Advaita. I think a deeper research in to Bhakti and Advaita is
required.

In Yoga, Enlightenment and Perfection Sringeri Periyava answers his
disciple's question whether after realising the falsehood of all forms he
looked upon saradambal's form also like that. But he answered that he was
moved with tears - emotion there? :) I don't think Bhakti is an emotion as
you say. I tend to go with SBh which says Bhakti is a Manovrtti or
Madhusudana who says it is non-different from Bhagavan.

Best Regards
