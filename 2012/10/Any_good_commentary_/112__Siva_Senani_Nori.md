>The difficulty stems from the fact that Sarva Darsana Sangraha uses tarka to bothintroduce a system and to refute a system. Tarka, like mathematics, is a meta-language. Constant exposure - i.e. plodding on even in the absence of a complete understanding, and then re-visiting -is the best solution, in the absence of a teacher.
