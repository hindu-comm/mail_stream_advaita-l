Dear Durga Prasad Garu,

Mahamahopadhyaya Pullela Sriramachandrudu Garu has translated the same into Telugu.
Since you are in Hyderabad, the copies are available in Gopal Publications, Kachiguda and as well as in Samskrita Prachara Samiti, near Nampally Rly Stn Road, above ISKCON temple.

I have that copy by Sri Pullela Garu. It has also the appendix which contains some beautiful compositions by Sri Polagam Rama Sastrigal.

regs,
sriram
