Yes. Many of the followers of Chaitanya Mahapraphu are a misguided lot. When Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was a youngster he was very proud of his knowledge of Sanskrit grammar. In his days Navadweep was a place where there were many great scholars of Sanskrit. Once when the great scholar Keshav Kashmiri Bhattacharya came to Navadweep the young Chaitanya Mahaprabhu challenged the former's knowledge of Sanskrit and asked him to compose a Sanskrit poem offhand on a particular topic. The latter did compose a nice poem. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu then asked the latter for a greater debate the next day. The debate did not take place and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu took the Shodashakshara mahamantra from the latter. Thus Chaitanya Mahaprabhu had his allegiance to Nimbarka / Keshav Kashmiri school. He called his school as Achintya Bheda-bheda school. Obviously Chaitanya Mahaprabhu got over his ego and achieved great spiritual heights. There is a false claim floating all around
 that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was influenced by the Madhva school and nothing can further from truth as Achintya Bhedabheda does not correspond to Madhvacharya's philosophy. Yet Some of the followers of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu down these centuries are more Dvatic than Achintya Bhedabhedic. As these people are not sure about their own moorings it is better not to argue with them. Further they are supposed to read the Bhagavad Gita, yet they do not know that Lord Krishna told that he created the world with his Maya. Instead of thinking of the wrold as Vishnumaya they think that the advaitins have fantasized the creation as Maya.

Rajaram, I'm sure you know the Tamil expression, "araicca mAvaiye tirumbi araikkaradu."

How many times and in how many ways should writings like this be countered? The date
on your link is 2007. The internet had discussions galore on the same topic, in the 1990s,
when Usenet newsgroups were the latest and the greatest in online fora. The genesis of
this mailing list as well as a few other similar lists, such as the dvaita mailing list, owes
itself to those days of Usenet discussions. A Google search will pull up hundreds of counter
arguments.

ps. For those who do not know Tamil, the expression above means "to grind the already
ground flour". That is my opinion of the contents of the link cited below.
