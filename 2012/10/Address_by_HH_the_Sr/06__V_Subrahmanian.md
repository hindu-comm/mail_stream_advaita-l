Namaste

Here is the link from where one can listen to the address by the Sringeri
Jagadguru in Sanskrit at the Valedictory function of the vAkyArtha sadas at
Chennai on 1.10.2012.

It is a talk on the history of this tradition of 'sadas' in the Sringeri
Peetham, the greatness of the shAstras, etc.
