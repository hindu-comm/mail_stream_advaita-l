If there is no maya, why is there a duality? We all see objects of duality. Objects do not go away even when we don't see them in deep sleep or in samadhi. One can say  that object less consciousness is a neurological phenomenon like deep sleep and Advaita is a philosophy that explains experiences and non-experience. Other philosophies also do. For example, vaishnavas will say that advaita is a state the lord puts advaitins in because they don't want this or the world of god.

Dear Suresh,

Actually there is no such entity called 'mAyA'.  It is provisionally
admitted just in order to explain samsAra.  Once the purpose of this
admittance is achieved mAyA is dropped.  This is called 'adhyAropa-apavAda'
in the Scripture.

Brahman does not produce mAyA.  The Bh.GitA 13th chapter says: prakRti
(another name for mAyA) is anAdi.

Regarding the purpose: at one stage it can be said the world is created in
order to provide the bhoga for the jiva-s who have accumulated karma.  But
at a higher level this explanation is also given up in order to let the
aspirant appreciate the non-dual Truth that is Advaita.

It would be a fine exercise to start listening to Swami Paramarthananda's
lectures on the Mandukya Upanishad in English spanning 80 hours.  This is
available in MP3 at the shAstraprakAshikaa trust, Chennai.  You can see
most of your questions answered by taking up this exercise sincerely.
