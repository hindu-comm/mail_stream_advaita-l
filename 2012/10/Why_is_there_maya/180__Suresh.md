Namaste,

I find this hard to understand. There is only one truth, nondual and eternal. But there is duality in this world because of maya. But why is there maya, where did it come from? What is it about Brahman's nature that it produces maya (which in turn produces this world of duality). Is there a purpose to it?

Thanks,
Suresh
