Subbuji - PraNAms and thanks for this info.
I looked at the Advaita-vishishTaadvaita book by Sreeman Chari maama - there were actually around 60+ or so items than hundred - with understanding that hunderd is only symbolic word used.
The arguments mostly follow navya nyaata - but not much on the fundamentalissues other than dialectic hair -splitting arguments which only split the hair than any substantive philosophical content,even if one wants to refute them. Reminds me of slokas 49 and 50 in Panchadasi Ch.1,where Nayaavaisheshika's arguments are dismissed by Shree Vidyaranya.

Hari Om!
Sadananda

>Shree Ananta Krishna Sastri had a friendly attitude towards 'all'. He had respect for Vedanta Deshika for being a sannyAsin, a vairAgya sampanna and a bhagavadbhakta above all. In view of all this Shri Sastri did not take the usual method of refuting / replying by using 'asat', 'asaaram', 'tuccham' etc. On the other hand, he used what is called 'mRdUktiH', soft-language, and presented the Advaitic position as an unassailable one and thereby indirectly conveyed to the 'opponent' that all his 'dUShaNam-s' have absolutely no place in the face of such a strong and self-consistent system that Advaita is.

>Many, most, people could not discern or fathom the depth of Sri Sastri's work and method and ended up concluding as Shri ChAri mAma did. In the conversation Shri Mani Dravid SastrigaL also told me an interesting anecdote:
>
>It seems the Kanchi PeriyavA Sri Chandrashekharendra Saraswati SwaminaH was the one who selected/suggested the name: shatha bhUShaNI. It seems Sri Sastri's native village is 'nUraNi', a place in the PAlakkAD province of Kerala. This word translates to 'nUru = shatam' and 'aNi = an ornament in Tamil: 'aNi, aNikalan' are the words used by Tamil writers, old and modern, to mean an (any) ornament. So the derived name: shatabhUShaNI has a fine rhyming effect with 'shatadUShaNI'. It was not a point-by-point rebuttal but a fine, fitting reply, and yet a work of someone who is from 'nUraNi'.
