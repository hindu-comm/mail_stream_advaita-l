Namaste,
//In the recently concluded araadhana of Sri Abhinava Vidyathirtha
Mahasvaminaha(Mahaswamigal),Acharyal was doing abhishekham/puja to a
black salagraamam//Yati (Jagatguru) ArAdhana is done by invoking their
jeeva kaLa either on akSata/lemon/betel leaf/bANa linga/sAlagrAma.

shAstra says "taNDUlE vA nimbapahlESu vA pUgIphalESu vA
linga sAlagrAmESu vA anyavigrahAdiSu vA gurudEvata IshwarabuddhiM
krutvA....".

In sringeri, vyAsa puja & guru Aradhana is done by invoking the
kaLAs on vyAsa sAlagrAma and nrisimhasAlagrAma.

In Kanchi mutt, the vyAsa puja is done by invoking the
kaLAs on nimba phala (lemon).

This is the saMpradAya bhEda in the respective mutts. 

In sringeri, the pradhAna upAsya mUrties are:

sphaTika linga (chandramoulishwara), sriyantra carved on sphaTika
shila, ratnagarbha gaNapati, vyAsa sAlagrAma, Aditya, narasimha sAlagrAma.

Apart from the above, there is a linga which was handed down by the
descendants of Sri Appayya Dikshitar. Sri Appayya Dikshitar worshipped
marakata sriyantra & marakata linga which also receives equal adoration
by jagatgurus.

The daily ablutions of muttAdhipati is to chant the respective srividyA
AmnAya mantrAs and the chief being nrisimha anuSTub mantra which is
called mantrarAja in srividya.  For current acharya, Nilakanta Dikshitar's Anandasagara Stavah, Sadasiva Brahmendra's
Atmavidya Vilasa, Nrisimha purva & uttara tApini upaniSads are
something special.

regs,
sriram
