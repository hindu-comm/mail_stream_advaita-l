Yes, the Rishi, devatA, Chandas, etc. are required while doing pUjA, and
for that matter even while doing other karmas, including homa. They are not
to be recited during apara karmas (such as shrAddha, etc.), as far as I
know.

Ahnika chandrikA is an authentic source, since it is based on earlier
works. The brahmakarmasamuccaya is a comprehensive and detailed manual,
where Ahnika AchAra prakaraNa is just one part. It also deals with
saMskAras, vratas, miscellaneous karmas, and aurdhvadehika karmas.
