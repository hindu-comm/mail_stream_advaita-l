praNAms Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for the very useful information.  Just my observation :

I have presented below the Rg vedic mantras that are commonly utilized
in what is called nitya pUjA, the daily pUjA..

>  what we see today in Ritvik circle, we use both yajurveda & Rigveda 
maNtra-s for shOdasha upachAra pooja irrespective of the shAkha.  In 
yajurveda prayOga, we chant devi sUkta, pavamAna, gaNesha sUkta etc. and 
Rigveda prayOga or devatArchana, we use namaka, chamaka, durgA sUkta ( 
yajurvedeeya) etc.  During pnachAmrutAbhishekaM also as you mentioned 
along with sadyOjAtAdi pancha maNtra, we recite Arambha maNtra of four 
veda-s (agnimeeLe, ishetvorjetva, agna AyAhi, shannOdevi) and sheekshAm 
vyAkhyAsAmaH from taitireeya. Here also no strict observation of 
sva-shAkha. 

svasharIra malodvAsana-

yebhyo mAtA (10.63.3)

evA pitre (4.50.6). Also occurs in the atharva veda (20.88.6) and
taittirIya saMhitA (1.8.22.2).

>  These maNtra-s we chant during puNyAha (in yajurveda prayOga) while 
offering the pAda pUja to mAtru & pitru.

KalashArchanam - gaN^gAdyAvAhana-

imaM me gaN^ge (10.75.5). Also occurs in Taittirya AraNyaka (10.1.13)

>  Rigvedeeya imaM me gaNge yamune saraswati maNtra have different svara-s 
when compared to taittireeya yajurAraNyaka same maNtra-s.  And in 
yajurveda kalashArchanaM we use maNtra apOvAidagaM sarvaM also alongwith 
gangecha yamune chaive godAvari sarasvati shlOka.

>  Prabhuji, shankhArchana also we do in yajurveda after kalashArchana 
using again some rigvedeeya maNtra-s along with shaNkha gAyatri maNtra. 

>  and with regard to panchAyatana AvAhana though maNtra-s are somewhat 
same, svara-s are different, for Aditya Avahana we also use adityOvA esha 
etanmandalaM (aditya upAsana maNtra-s) from taitereeya AraNyaka ( or in 
mAhANArAyaNa upanishad).

> in addition to panchAmruta abhishekaM we also do phala snAna (kadaLi) by 
chanting apaitu mrutyu amtrutaM maNtra-s.  And also maNgaLa dravyA-s like 
gandhOdaka, pushpOdaka, suvarNOdaka, rudrAkshOdaka, tulasyOdaka, 
bhasmOdaka, bilvOdaka, dUrvOdaka etc. 

>  and for vastra, upaveeta, gandha, akshata samarpaNaM also we use 
yajurveda purusha sUkta maNtra-s.  for example, for vastra, saptAsyAsaM 
paridhayaH, for upaveeta : taM yajnaM baruhishi praukshan etc.

akShata samarpaNam -

upAsmai gAyatA (9.11.1).

>  along with the pavamAna sUkta maNtra we use archata prArchata & ayenete 
parAyaNe maNtra-s also.

puShpasamarpaNam -

Ayane te parAyaNe (10.142.8).

>  yOpAm pushpaM veda, pushpavAN pashumAn bhavati etc. 

> and we do ashtAvadhAna seva and rAshtrAshirvAda after devatArchana when 
it is done at public place. 

>  BTW, I have seen in somany pavamANa hOma-s, ritviks skipping rishi, 
devata, chandas in pavamAna sUkta, I think due to time constraints :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
