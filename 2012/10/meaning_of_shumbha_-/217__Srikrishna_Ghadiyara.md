Om!

Sri Eswara Satyanarayana Sarma, a well known Devi Upasaka , Guru to many in Andhra, and a prolific writer on Devi Tattva explained the philosophical representation as follows:

Madhu Kaitabha - bahutva vaancha and bahutva aananda, respectively
Raktabija - jeeva bhava (Atma bija acquiring vishessha of jeeva)
Mahishasura - rajo guna (krodha)
Chanda Munda - pravritti and nivritti, respectively
Shumbha and Nishumbha - Asmita and Mamata (I and Mine), respectively.

Regards

Srikrishna

OM
Since you know sanskrit grammar you will appreciate that the language
anchors on dHAtu (root) and how the word yields to the objective of the
communication.
