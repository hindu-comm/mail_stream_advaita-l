Namaste SriKrishna,

Thanks for this explanation:
madhu = bahutva vaancha (desire to be many) seems to be quite appropriate
kaiTabha = bahutva Ananda (joy in manifestation of many) - I am not too sure.

In an link on the internet (copied below) I found an interesting derivation
of kaiTabha : keeTa (insect) + bha (similarity, resemblance)
(other than this derivation, I am not too sure of the remaining interpretation
of madhu-kaiTabha given in the link)
http://sanjayprabhakaran.blogspot.in/2006/05/meaning-behind-madhu-kaitabha-story.html

Let us say:
madhu = bahutva (vAncha + Ananda)
and kaiTabha = like insects

That is, here the bahutva is crossing all limits and is in excessive amount like
number of insects. This seems reasonable.

Thanks again.

Regards,
Shrinivas

Om!

Sri Eswara Satyanarayana Sarma, a well known Devi Upasaka , Guru to many in Andhra, and a prolific writer on Devi Tattva explained the philosophical representation as follows:

Madhu Kaitabha - bahutva vaancha and bahutva aananda, respectively
Raktabija - jeeva bhava (Atma bija acquiring vishessha of jeeva)
Mahishasura - rajo guna (krodha)
Chanda Munda - pravritti and nivritti, respectively
Shumbha and Nishumbha - Asmita and Mamata (I and Mine), respectively.

Regards

Srikrishna

OM
Since you know sanskrit grammar you will appreciate that the language
anchors on dHAtu (root) and how the word yields to the objective of the
communication.
