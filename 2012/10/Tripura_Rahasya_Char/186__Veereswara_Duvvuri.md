Pujya Krishna Das ji,



Pranamams.


I am also interested in the book and a treatise on the same. I understand
from Pujay Hanumad Sitarama Sarmaâ€™s translation of Jna Khanda that this
Charya Khanda is lost.

I will be greatly indebted to you if you can guide me with the text and
treatise if you come across.

With humble obeisance to your feet.

Have a nice day,
With best regards,
Sarma Duvvuri.
