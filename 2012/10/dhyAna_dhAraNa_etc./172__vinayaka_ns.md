====================================

Namaste,

Shankara on how the concentrated mind intuits the reality:

B.G. 20. At the time when the mind restrained through the practice of Yoga
gets withdrawn, and just when by seeing the Self by the self one remains
contented in the Self alone [A.G. construes the word eva (certainly) with
tusyati (remains contented).-Tr.];

Yatra, at the time when; cittam, the mind; niruddham, restrained, entirely
prevented from wandering; uparamate, gets withdrawn; yoga-sevaya, through
the practice of Yoga; ca, and; yatra eva, just when, at the very moment
when; *pasyan, by seeing, by experiencing; atmanam, the Self*, which by
nature is the supreme light of Consciousness; atmana, by the self, by the
mind purified by concentration; tusyati, one remains contented, gets
delighted; atmani eva, in one's own Self alone-.

When he (the Yogi) feels that infinite bliss which can be grasped by the
(pure) intellect
and which transcends the senses, and, established wherein he never moves
from the Reality,

21. When one experiences that absolute Bliss which can be intuited by the
intellect and which is beyond the senses, and being established (thus) this
person surely does not swerve from Reality;

Yatra, when, at the time when; vetti, one experiences; tat, that;
atyantikam, absolute-which is verily limitless, i.e. infinite; sukham,
Bliss; yat, which; buddhi-grahyam, can be* intuited by the intellect,
intuited by the intellect alone, without the help of the senses*; and which
is atindriyam, beyond the senses, i.e. not objective; (-when
one experiences this kind of Bliss) and sthitah, being established in the
nature of the Self; ayam, this person, the illumined one; eva, surely; na
calati, does not swerve; tattvatah, from that Reality-i.e. does not deviate
from the nature of Reality-

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
