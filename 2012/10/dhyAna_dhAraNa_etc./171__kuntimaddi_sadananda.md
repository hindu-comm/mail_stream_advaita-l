Subbuji - PraNAms

You are coupling manana-nidhidhyaasana into one while separating shravana. I have a feeling the Sureswara in Naiskarmya siddhi - couples shravana-manana as requirement for all adhikaaries while Nidhidhyaasana as separate intended particularly for manda adhikaaries. Logically too shravana and manana should be involved for clear understanding -whether it is paroksha or aparoksha jnaana and it will be one or the other dependingon the chitta suddhi of the seeker, as Sureswara implies. 

Hari Om!
