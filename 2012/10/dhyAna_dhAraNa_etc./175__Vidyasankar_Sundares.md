Namaskaras Swamiji,

The history and background to this discussion thread is that there is a section of
people that wants to reject yoga even as a means to the end. What I have been
painstakingly pointing out and what I think Sri Subrahmanian is also doing with
other quotations, is to show that yoga is indeed endorsed as a means in the
bhAshya-s.

With best regards,
Vidyasankar
