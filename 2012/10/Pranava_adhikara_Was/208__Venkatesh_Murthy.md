Namaste

Yes the restriction is for Mantra Diksha, Mantra Japa and Prayoga like
Homa. Non dvijas and females cannot have Mantra Diksha with Om in
it.Many people are doing Japa like the Shadakshari Mantra and Narayana
Ashtakshari but it will not have any effect. Vedic Om is a very secret
word. Tamils may say it but it is not same Vedic Om. I have seen one
Sudra's son's name is Om. It is not Vedic Om.

When Guru says the Om directly in the ear of a qualified Dvija the
vocal vibrations are producing a different spiritual effect. When a
Non dvija or female is saying it the same vibrations will not be
there.
