Namaste,

This approach is not something alien to the tradition; rather it is the
most important part of sAdhanA. Here are the words of Swami Chandrashekara
Bharati of Sringeri:

Among the material aids for achieving moksha, bhakti is the greatest.
Continuous contemplation of one's essential nature (svarUpa) is said to be
bhakti. (VC 33)

By svasvarUpAnusandhAna contemplation on one's essential nature,
nididhyAsana (profound repeated meditation) is meant. That alone can serve
as the immediate means to direct realisation. The continuous contemplation
of the shruti text and the upadesha of the guru: sa AtmA tattvamasi ( that
is the Atman; That thou art): " Thy essential nature is Brahman; thou art
That only", is the indespensable means (asAdhAraNa kAraNa) of such
realisation. This contemplation (anusandhAna) is of the form of the
exclusion of contrary ideas and is marked by a continuous flow of accordant
ideas. shama etc., are the cause of jnAna mediated by vichAra and
nididhyAsana . But nididhyAsana is the immediate cause for it. Because it
produces direct realisation, it is said to be the greatest among sAdhanAs
that make for jnAna which is revelatory of one's true nature which is
synonymous with moksha....

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
