Ye, that is the true state. However our assuming an identity with the body, which we got from the Prakriti or Maya, is the obstacle to realizing the true state. That is why the Yogavasistha asks us to meditate on the body-less state.

Neither is distruction nor creation, neither is there a bonded person nor a
spiritual practisoner,
neither is there a person aspiring for liberation nor one liberated, this
is the paramartha.
