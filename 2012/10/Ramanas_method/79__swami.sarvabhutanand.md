Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Ramana's method

The four yuktis are

1. Effect is unreal because it is found to be essentially non-different
from its cause (e.g. pot - clay). While the effect is changeful and
inconstant, the cause is changeless and constant. That which is inconstant
is unreal and that which constant is real.
2. The variable is imagined on invariable. While the variable, the pot, is
changeful the invariable, the substratum, is constant.
3. Awareness is not destroyed even when the object is destroyed. It is
present exactly the same way in the space and in other objects of the same
class or different class.
4. Awareness is not dependent on the reality of the object (e.g awareness
of water in mirage)

Is this correct?
