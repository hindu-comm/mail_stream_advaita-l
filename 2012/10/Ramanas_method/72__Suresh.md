Thanks, mr. K and mr. S. my concern at the moment is applying advaita to life. As of now, my advaita is theoretical. There is no experience of any sort, so I am wondering what to do. At least some sort of experience through meditation could help, that's why I thought of atma vichara. Vrttis are hard to stop. They keep going like a river, and suppression doesn't help.
