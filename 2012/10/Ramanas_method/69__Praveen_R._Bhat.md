Could you please explain the meaning of "out of tradition"? That phrase is
ambiguous. Does it mean that the teaching that comes from the tradition or
one that goes out of tradition and so is against? If you mean the latter,
its meaningless to our discussion since I'm considering only teaching with
traditional basis. If you meant former, then I'd be shocked to know that
Bhagavatpada says that teaching that develops from the tradition has to be
discarded!
