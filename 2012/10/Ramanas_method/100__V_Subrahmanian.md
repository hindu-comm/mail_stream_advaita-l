In Advaitic tradition there is the requirement of what is known as
'akhanDAkAravRtti' which is said to be a kShaNa-trayAtmikA-vRttiH.  It will
arise, destroy avidyA and will also be destroyed.  Shankara refers to this
in the Mandukya Upanishad bhashya for the mantra no. 7:

 ज्ञानस्य द्वैतनिवृत्तिक्षणव्यतिरेकेण क्षणान्तरानवस्थानात् । अवस्थाने
चानवस्थाप्रसङ्गाद्द्वैतानिवृत्तिः ।
तस्मात्प्रतिषेधविज्ञानप्रमाणव्यापारसमकालैवात्मन्यध्यारोपितान्तःप्रज्ञत्वाद्यनर्थानिवृत्तिरिति
सिद्धम् ।

//...for knowledge (as a mental state) does not continue for a second
moment following that of the cessation of duality.  Should it, however,
continue, it will lead to infinite regress resulting in non-cessation of
duality. // (Translation by Swami Gambhirananda)

Shankara has talked of 'anubhavajnAnam' in a number of places.  One
instance, for example, is the Brahma sutra bhashya 4.1.2 (लिङ्गाच).:

तस्मात्सर्वदुःखविनिर्मुक्त एकचैतन्यात्मकः अहं इत्येष *आत्मानुभवः*    ।

न च एवं आत्मानं *अनुभवतः *किञ्चितन्यत्कृत्यं अवशिष्यते ।

तथा च श्रुतिः ऽकिं प्रजया करिष्यामो येषां नोऽयमात्मायं लोकःऽ (बृ. ४.४.२२)
इति आत्मविदः कर्तव्य अभावं दर्शयति । स्मृतिः अपि ’यस्त्वात्मरतिरेव
स्यादात्मतृप्तश्च मानवः    ।

आत्मन्येव च संतुष्टस्य कार्यं न विद्यते’ (गी. ३.१७) इति    ।

यस्य तु न एषः अनुभवो द्रागिव जायते तं *प्रत्यनुभवार्थ* एव आवृत्ति अभ्युपगमः
।


The Anandagiri gloss for the above says, among other things:
तस्मादेवानुभवात्कृतकृत्यता इत्यत्र मानमाह - तथा चेति । [From that
anubhava/experience alone will there be kRtakRtyatA (fulfillment/
attainment of the genuine state of 'nothing else need be done') arises for
which the proof/pramANa is the Gita verse: 3.15 cited in the bhashyam
above)


You can see the translation in Sw.Gambhirananda's book, at the concluding
portion of the bhashya for this sutra.  He uses the word 'realization'.
