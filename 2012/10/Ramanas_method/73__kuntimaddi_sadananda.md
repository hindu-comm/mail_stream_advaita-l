Sureshji
- PraNams - 
you have just pointed out another misconception related to
self-realization. 
Now please tell me- when is the time you are
not experiencing yourself? It is not experience where there is an experiencer-experienced-
experiencing - which is time bound; but clear understanding that I do not need
any specific experience and I am revealed in every experience - prati bodha
viditam matam - says Kenopanishat. Shankara calls Samyak Darshnam - clear
vision of the truth as I am that. Tat tvam asi. That is the reason why
Vedanta insists on a live sampradaaya teacher for Vedantic study. My best
wishes
Hari Om!
Sadananda


  
>Thanks, mr. K and mr. S. my concern at the moment is applying advaita to life. As of now, my advaita is theoretical. There is no experience of any sort, so I am wondering what to do. At least some sort of experience through meditation could help, that's why I thought of atma vichara. Vrttis are hard to stop. They keep going like a river, and suppression doesn't help.
