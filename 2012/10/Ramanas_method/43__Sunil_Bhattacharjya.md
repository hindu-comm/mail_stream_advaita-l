Actually, it is a rather simple matter to give advaitic interpretations 
to scriptural quotes from a wide variety of religions. I would venture 
to suggest that those who post on the Arunachala Ramana forums need to 
ask themselves what texts and quotes were proactively used by Ramana 
Maharishi himself. I'm quite sure that these would be the Upanishads and texts such as Vivekachudamani, with the addition of perhaps a few Tamil texts aligned more with Saiva Siddhanta of the advaitic kind.

I think Ramana Maharshi recommended the texts such as Yoga-Visishtha Ramayana, Tripura-Rahsya and Ashtavakra Gita to supplement the Bhagavad Gita and the Vedas. The main stream Advaitins on the other hand would fist think of the Sankarabhashyas, Naishkarmya siddhi, Advaitasiddhi, Siddhantalesasamgraha, Jivanmuktiviveka and Vivekachudamani etc. What I mean to say is that while ultimately it is advaita that both the camps aim at, yet pedagogically the approach is probably quite different. Kindly correct me if I am wrong.

Dear Sri Sanjay,

I think you have captured the crux of the issues involved in these kinds of discussions between followers of Ramana Maharishi and others quite well. While I cannot claim to be conversant with this level of detail as to who among Ramana's disciples said what and when, I would like to point out just a couple of constraints that need to be taken into consideration.

a. What is effective for one person is not necessarily effective for another, and 

b. An established paramparA cannot be firm if it is based primarily on the personal experience of one person or even a few people, no matter how exalted they may be. This holds true as much for Sankara bhagavatpAda as for anybody else, including Ramana Maharishi.

Perhaps those who wish to emphasize SAstra vicAra are really more concerned about the second point above than anything else.

For what it is worth, do consider the fact that Swami Chinmayananda was a disciple of Swami Tapovan and Swami Sivananda, the latter of whom was a disciple of Swami Vishvananda, who in turn, as per all accounts, was from the Sringeri Peetham. As such, purely pro forma, the contemporary champions of "traditional Vedanta" do have a living tradition to refer themselves to. That need not mean that they are official spokespeople of that tradition, nor need any of this mean that all Ramana disciples fall outside the same wider tradition.

I rather think that Ramana Maharishi himself would have merely smiled ironically, both at the criticisms of his teaching methods and the resentment generated in response among his followers. Let me close with the statement that in Sankara bhagavatpAda's view, both the general SAstra and the specific guru upadeSa are necessary and to be given due weight by a disciple. The exact mix that works for each person will necessarily be unique to that person. 

With best regards,
Vidyasankar
