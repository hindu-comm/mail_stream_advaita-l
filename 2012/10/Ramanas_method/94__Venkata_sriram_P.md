Namaste,

சும்மா இரு (Be quiet)

The devotee was none other than Tinnai Swami. 

Vicinity of great saints itself is a great sAdhana. We don't know how the spiritual instructions are imparted by them which depends upon the disciple's receptivity.

The Totakacharya, a dull student, was blessed by Sankara with just a thought ! 
And lo ! he became a great acharya and composed Totakashtaka.

Similarly, the spiritual instructions of Bhagavan varied from disciple to disciple which depended upon the maturity of them. A certan devotee was asked by Bhagavan to
chant the mantra *om namo bhagavate ramanaya*.

Among the methods of deekSa, there is a method of *drik deekSa* which is sufficient to make the disciple a full fledged yogi.

regs,
sriram
