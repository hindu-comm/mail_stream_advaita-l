In fact Dr.Mani Dravid SastrigaL who is perhaps unmatched in scholarship
had this to say:  It is enough for a mumukshu to take up just one text,
even a prakaraNa grantha like 'aparokshanubhuti' or 'Atmabodha' and
sincerely practice what has been taught there.  There is no need for
delving into countless texts, bhashyams, etc.

praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji

I dont know in which context Sri Mani Dravid shAstrigaL said some 
prakaraNa grantha is enough for brahma jignAsa.  Is he intended here to 
say even for the sAdhaka-s who have vedAdhikAra, prakaraNa grantha would 
suffice without any veda shAstrAdhyayana??  If prakaraNa grantha-s 
themselves act as valid pramANa for the brahma jignAsa why there is so 
much emphasis on shAstras' antya prAmANyatva??  Kindly clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
