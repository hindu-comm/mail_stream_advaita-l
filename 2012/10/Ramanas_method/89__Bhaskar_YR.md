OM Advaita is for understanding and no experience involved!
Understanding correctly can change the personailty by vision change WRT 
the
JAGAT.
One cannot say one has understood but wants to expeience  is wrong
understanding.

Your observation is interesting.  May I ask for little elaboration please. 
 Some of the advaita scholars are of the opinion that there is a gap 
between Atma jnAna AND Atma sAkshAtkAra and they argue that Atma jnAna or 
paramArtha jnAna  should be practically experienced in a state called 
samAdhi and mukti follows after Atma jnAna and the jeevan mukti is not the 
real mukti (gauNa) as he ( the jeevan mukta) still carries avidyAlesha or 
prArabdha and hence only videha mukti is ultimate (mukhya) mukti.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
