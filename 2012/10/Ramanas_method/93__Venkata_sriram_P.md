Namaste,
// What exactly is the point of the inquiry //
Every devotee of Bhagavan should study the book written by Sri K.Lakshmana Sarma.The name of the book is *Maha Yoga* and the author, even though a great scholar ofadvaita who studied the advaita siddhAnta in Sringeri traditionally, never bothered toexhibit his scholarship. So much so that, the book *Maha Yoga* was publishedwith an anonymous name *Who*.
Though this book *Maha Yoga* is a hard nut to crack during initial reading, constantmeditation on it and repeated reading would have a deep impact in one's spiritual quest.
But, first and foremost advice is study thoroughly Sankara's *Dakshinamurti Stotra* which has answers to most of the questions posed by layman of advaita.
