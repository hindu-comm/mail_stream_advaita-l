In my experience with many vedanta teachers the emphasis given to
shravaNa, manana and nididhyAsana is exactly in the reverse order with
shravaNa getting the highest importance followed by manana and
practically no emphasis on nididhyAsana.

I dont think we have to read too much and take sri mahA periyal's words 
literally.  shravaNaM, mananaM and nidhidhyAsana are the direct sadhana-s 
( sAkshAt sAdhana-s) prescribed for the brahma jignAsa.  If the sAdhaka 
does not get jnAna through shravaNa he has to continue his sAdhana in 
manana and nidhidhyAsana.  Ranking one over the other is not at all 
warranted here as all the three sAdhAna-s are equally important for the 
sAdhaka-s.  Shankara while recommending these sAdhana-s does not rank 
these sAdhana-s one over other, he simply says if mere shravaNa does not 
get you mOksha you have to do subsequent sAdhana-s like manana and 
nidhyAsana.  Some relevant observations of shankara we can find in tattu 
samanvayAt sUtra bhAshya (1-1-4) and in phalAdhyAya i.e. 4th adhyAya of 
sUtra.
