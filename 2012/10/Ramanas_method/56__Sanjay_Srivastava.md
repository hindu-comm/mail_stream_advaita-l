Viewed from this perspective it can be said that Sri Bhagwan only
restored the relative importance of shravaNa, manana and nididhyAsana
in self enquiry and brought it in line with tradition.

In my experience with many vedanta teachers the emphasis given to
shravaNa, manana and nididhyAsana is exactly in the reverse order with
shravaNa getting the highest importance followed by manana and
practically no emphasis on nididhyAsana.
