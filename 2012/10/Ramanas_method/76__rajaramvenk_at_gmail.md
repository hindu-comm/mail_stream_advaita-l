Intellectually I can infer that the perceived world is unreal. I also know that I exist as the basis of all my experiences. But how do I know for a fact that I will exist after death of the body? I can believe in sastras that tell me so but is there a way to know it directly?

Shree Rajaram - PraNAms 
A
simple answer is to recognize that I am there in the thoughts too. I have to
discard the reality that Ihave assumed to the naama-ruupa contents of the
thoughts. The trapping of the mind with naama - ruupa of the thoughts happens
due to lack of complete chitta suddhi, since the mind is getting trapped due to
remnant raaga dveshaas and I am still giving reality to them. Hence nidhidhyaasana
on the mahaavaakya that is understood by shravana and manana has to be
constantly applied by the mind. It is not an experience but understanding not
as objectified knowledge but understanding as I am the essence which is direct
and immediately presentin every experience. That is what Shree Subbuji explained recently
in response to Jnaanam and Vijnaanam question. 
Hope this helps.
Hari Om!
