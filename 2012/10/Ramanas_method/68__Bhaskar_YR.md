You seem to be of the opinion that only shruti vAkya AS IS is useful for
realization in the tradition while I feel that as long as any teaching is
derivative of the shruti, basing itself on the advaita tattva, it holds
good for realization.

Those who know the importance of saMpradAya & sAmpradAyik teaching would 
say sAmpradAyik teaching will be through shAstra only not by any other 
means or any bits and pieces from individual teacher's teaching.  shankara 
somewhere says if any teaching, however strong it is, comes out of the 
tradition that has to be discarded as invalid.  Anyway, this is what 
sampradAya vida-s stand on Agama and untya pramANa status of vedAnta 
shAstra.  But nowadays we hardly see this rigidity in practicality of 
advaita saMpradAya. Hence, I have to agree with your observation going by 
the current trend :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
