Dear friends,

Thanks for all the insights. It will take some time to study them carefully, but in the meantime I have a doubt related to this. This has been gnawing at me for a long time. 

In dualistic traditions, god vision is the objective, and even in Buddhism the seeker looks out for jhanas and such experiences. So my question is, Must something extraordinary happen in an advaitin's life to confirm that his advaitic realization is genuine, perhaps the advaitin equivalent of a jhana? If an advaitin has no such experience all his life (only theoretical understanding), does that mean his knowledge will not liberate him at death, and that he will have to take birth again?

Suresh
