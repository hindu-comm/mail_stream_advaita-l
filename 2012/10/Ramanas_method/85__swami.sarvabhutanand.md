Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Ramana's method

Vishy - PraNAms
Yes
- it is realization that the existence-consciousness that I am pervades this
entire universe of names and forms - I am in all and all in Me. That is what
Bhagavan Ramana also taught. The very first sloka of Sat Darshanam is essential
summary of Cha. Up. One needs to understand What Bhagavan taught. 
In
the self-realization of my true nature I understand also all naama ruupa
projects is my own
vibhuti
too - for formality one can say it is Iswara Vibhuti - by I have realized I am
the substratum of jiiva-jagat-Iswara. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda

>>Thanks, mr. K and mr. S. my concern at the moment is applying advaita to life. As of now, my advaita is theoretical. There is no experience of any sort, so I am wondering what to do. At least some sort of experience through meditation could help, that's why I thought of atma vichara. Vrttis are hard to stop. They keep going like a river, and suppression doesn't help.
