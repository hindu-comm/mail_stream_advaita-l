"" realization is to realize that there is nothing to realize""


Now I am understanding that in total and started meditating on the same

praNAms
Hare Krishna

As Sri sadananda prabhuji subsequently clarified, during the sAdhana 
period ( where jnAtru, jneya and jnAna triputi still intact)  we have to 
do sAdhana keeping the mOksha or paramArtha jnAna as the goal.  If we 
start doing sAdhana thinking there is 'nothing' then it is as good as 
shUnya.  So, IMO, instead of 'nothing' we have to start our sAdhana patha 
to realize 'something', and if we really realize that 'something' we would 
come to know that that 'something' is indeed 'everything' and one without 
second. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
