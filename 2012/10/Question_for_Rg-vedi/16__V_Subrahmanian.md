In my opinion no Rg vedic mantras/sukta-s are taught to Yajur vedins
if they are not going to engage in paurohitya.  In case they are going
to do paurohitya, they will require 'pavamAna sUktam' which is an
important one for Rg vedins.  This is often done as a pArAyaNam. Also,
sometimes when the purohit goes to a Rg vedin's house for prayoga, the
PuruSha/srI/narayana suktams in Rg vedic format might be of use to
make the yajamana of the house feel more satisfied.
