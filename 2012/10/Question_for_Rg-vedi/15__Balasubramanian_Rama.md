kR^iShna yajur vedins - if they don't undergo the full traditional study of
vedas - are taught commonly used parts like rudram, some suktas, etc. Can
someone post what important suktas are taught separately for prayoga such
as pUjAs? Please also give the exact reference if possible, i.e, which
maNDala it belongs to, etc.

Thanks!

Rama
