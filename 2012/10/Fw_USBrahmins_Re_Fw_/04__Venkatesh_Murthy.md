Namaste

Many years and centuries back the Dvaitis and Visistadvaitis
quarrelled with Advaitis. Not only that but also there was quarrelling
in Maths also. Sringeri Math followers are quarelling with Kanchi Math
followers. Like this in Dvaitis also one Math is quarrelling with
other Dvaiti Maths. In Srivaisnavas the Vadagalai group is quarrelling
with Tengalai. One person told me where there are Brahmins there will
always be quarrelling. Even if two Brahmins are there they will
quarrel. Why Brahmins are quarreling so much? Why a Brahmin wants to
find faults in other Brahmins so much? We must stop it.

Today we should have Broad Mind to say we are all Brahmins. All
Brahmins must be united.Today people from other castes are getting
more education and jobs than Brahmiins because of  reservation
system.I heard in learning Sanskrit also non Brahmins are coming up.
Brahmins are suffering very much. When Gandhi was assassinated they
killed many Brahmins. Why? Because Godse was Brahmin.

Vedic studies are suffering because  fathers are not sending sons to
Vedic education. In North India there is a very bad situation. There
are no Purohitas for performing Sraddha in Pitru Paksha.

We should unite all Brahmins and preserve our culture and stop quarrelling.
