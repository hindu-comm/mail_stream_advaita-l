It is a pity that even very learned scholars of Dvaita have made statements
such as 'when everything is same (for Advaitins) there is no difference
(for them) between a spouse and a parent. '  One blogger (not Dvaitin) told
me: 'you can eat excreta since for you both excreta and food are the
same.'  Such is the dismal understanding of Advaita on their part.  There
is a Sanskrit saying: 'abaddham paThitvA kuchodyam karoti' - a person
grasps a subject erroneously and raises inappropriate questions.

On another count I have it from the authority of top ranking Advaita
scholars that the objections against Advaita from the other schools is
solely because of a wrong understanding on their part of the Advaita
shAstra.  If only one understands Advaita correctly he will have nothing to
object against it.
