OM!

Recently, I saw this Sanskrit Only Bhagavatam Publication in the TTD Book stall located in the Free Anna Kshetram building, on the hills. I think all the Skandhas are now published. But, I did not see Skandhas 3 and 11. Probably those two were missing at that time in the book stall. As you can expect, the salesman in the book stall did not even mention this to me. All the other ten Skandhas were in 12 volumes. The price was Rs. 1200. Probably, if one takes the missing 2 volumes into account, the entire set may contain 14 volumes and cost Rs. 1400

It contains the Sanskrit commentaries ONLY of

1. Bhavartha Dipika of Sri Sridhara Swami
2. Bhagavata Chandra Chandrika of Sri Viraraghavacarya
3. Padaratnavali of Sri Vijayadhvaja Tirtha
4. Sudhi Sudha of Sri Radhakrishna

Om!

Srikrishna

TTD has published Sridhara Swami's Bhagavata Tika in sanskrit for some
skandhas
at a very reasonable price.
Contact TTD publications for details.
