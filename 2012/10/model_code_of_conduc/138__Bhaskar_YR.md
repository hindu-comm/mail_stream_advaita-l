gurubhyo namaha . could someone list out the codes for a householder
as advised by our samradaya.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

The list of codes depends upon the householder's varNa.  In general, an 
ideal householder should do the nitya & naimittika karma with 
bhagavadarpita buddhi, taking good care of his family members, serving the 
sAdhu-santa-s and should spend his leisure time in satsangha and 
svAdhyAya. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
