Namaste

Parent in laws have to be treated with respect like all elders. There
is no rule for special treatment by son in law. First look after own
parents. Then other elders including in laws. A son in law has to
avoid going to in laws house without reason. It will reduce his
respect. I know one family the brother in laws are controlling the
whole life of the son in law.  In Vishnu Purana and others they have
said in Kali Yuga sons will not look after parents and become attached
to in laws. This is a Kali Yuga defect. We must avoid it. We must look
after our parents first and if time is there other elders.
