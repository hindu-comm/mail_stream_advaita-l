PraNAms

I
agree with the contents of what Subbhuji wrote.
On the humor side, Swami Paramarthanandaji
told a sloka once - Do not remember it - but the essence is - After considering
that Lord Shiva took his shelter in his father-in-law place and that Lord
Vishnu also did the same thing, a fellow went to stay in his father-in-law's
place. First day he was treated with respect, the second was OK and the things
got deteriorated after the third day. After the fifth day, he wondering how
Lord Shiva and Vishnu managed took their permanent shelter in their in laws
houses, left the place learning that one should not stay more than 5days in
in-laws house.
Hari Om!
