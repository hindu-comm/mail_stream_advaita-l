Pranam Swamiji,

I have question with respect to duties of Son, and Son-in Law.
The reason I am asking this question is, I will be marrying in few months,
and due to grace of Acharya's and Guru's like you
I wanted to know, what all duties Vedas or Smritis prescribe if Son-in-law
to be done for his in-law.
And who should be prioritized, his own parents or in-laws. If you can
please list the reference from Veda's and Smritis I would be thankful.

Sadar Pranama,
Harsha
