Shri Subramanianji,
Namaskarams and Thanks.

I was in Sudharma that day and for an ignoramus like me,it 'seemed'
that were more mantras to Lord Shiva .The 'Narayana Suktam' was
chanted.Sri Rudram,chamakam,Purusha suktam,Taittriya Upanishad were
chanted to my untrained ear.

One last question.Is there any name for this black saligrama and why
is the other saligrama called Narasimha Saligrama?The mutt pandits
like Sri Krishna Bhatt were all very busy and couldnt ask them.
