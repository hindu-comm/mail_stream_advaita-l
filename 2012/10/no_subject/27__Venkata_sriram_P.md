'can advaitic jnaana be obtained independent of knowledge of upanishads and brahma sutra
//

The answer is Yes.  

This also happened with the Shri Satchidananda Nrsimha Bharati Mahaswamigal of Sringeri.
His Holiness was initiated into sanyasa at a tender age of 8 by Shri Vriddha Nrisimha
Bharati Swamigal. 

This happened just on the day His Holiness was given sanyasa.  Owing to the 
hectic rituals of sanyasa deeksha and mahavakya upadesa, the tender swamigal
of age 8 was extremely tired that day.   Shri Vriddha Narasimha Bharati fed
the young sanyasi (Shri Satchidananda Nrsimha Bharati) with fried grains
and made Him sleep on deer skin next to him while Shri Vriddha Nrisimha
Bharati Mahaswamigal was performing evening anustana.  The tender boy
soon fell asleep and was murmuring *sarvOhaM*. 

Mahaswamigal was astonished to hear this as on the very first day of 
sanyasa and that too at the tender age of 8, this young lad had
advaitic experience. 

Later, His Holiness used to say to one of His close disciples that
the subsequent studies of shAstrAs etc. just reiterated and reinforced
His experience.  His Holiness was a was a born jivanmukta like
Vamadeva.  

//
traditional vedantins -   read, advaitins - challenged him to provide
scriptural proof.
//

Some of the traditional vedantins themselves approached 
Bhagavan for paying their respects and clearing their doubts in shAstrAs and to 
name a few are Puri Shankaracharya, Sringeri Sivaganga Muttadhipati,
Shri Mouna Swamigal of Courtallam.  

Shri Satchidananda Nrismiha Bharati Mahaswamigal had highest
regards for Bhagavan.  One of the ashtottara nAmAvaLi of Ramana
Bhagavan is *shrI shringAdri-muThAdheesha-bhAvitAya namO namaH* 
ie., One who is held in High Esteem and respected by Sringeri Muttadhipati.

Regs,
Sriram
