Shree Ramjaram - PraNAms - the answer as provided is by clear understanding that whatever duality that I perceive is mithyaa that understanding comes  from mahavaakya vicaara - aitadaatmya idagam sarvam tat satyam - sa aatmaa - tat tvam asi.

It involves clear understanding that includes there is nothing else that is needed other than clear understanding - not as a thought but as a fact. 
Hari Om!
