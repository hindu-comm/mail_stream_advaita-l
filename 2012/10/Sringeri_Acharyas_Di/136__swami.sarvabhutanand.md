Subject: [Advaita-l] Sringeri Acharya's Discourses

A friend, Shri Lakshman, has shared the link to his video collections of
the various discourses/programs of the Sringeri Acharya during his current
vijaya yatra of the southern states of India, especially Tamil Nadu:

The collection is constantly updated.  It contains the Aradhana function of
Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha SwaminaH too (7.Oct.2012).
