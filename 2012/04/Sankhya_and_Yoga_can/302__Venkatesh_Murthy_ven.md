Namaste

But someone may object because the Svetashvatara Upanisad has directly
said Sankhya and Yoga can take you to Moksha. Adi Sankara will not
accept it because he is a Vedanti. He has to find some Vedantic
concepts and say Sankhya and Yoga are those Vedantic concepts only. He
is giving indirect meaning for Sankhya and Yoga when direct meaning is
available. Why?

How can you answer this objection?
