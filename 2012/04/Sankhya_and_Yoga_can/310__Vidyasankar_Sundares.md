The author of the commentary named jayamangalA was named Sankara,
but please bear in mind that through the history of Sanskrit writing, there
have been thousands, if not millions, of authors named Sankara. There is
no reason at all to believe that the author of this sAMkhya commentary
was the same as the advaita teacher Sankara bhagavatpAda.

Gopinath Kaviraj's publication of jayamangalA is perhaps the only one of
this text and the editor has argued forcefully that the author is the same
as the one who wrote a commentary on vAtsyAyana's kAmasUtra, also
called jayamangalA. Other scholars have opined that the author of the
jayamangalA was probably a buddhist and almost all of them express an
opninion that this commentary on the sAMkhyakArikA is of little value.

Actually, if you read through the set of links to posts made in the second
half of 2006, on the Yoga and Advaita Vedanta thread, you will see a lot
of references from the major prasthAna traya bhAshyas, which will tell
you exactly how Sankara bhagavatpAda addresses sAMkhya and yoga.
There is no need to speculate from dubious texts when you have direct
evidence from seminal texts.
