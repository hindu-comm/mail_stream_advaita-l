Namaste

In Holenarsipur Swami's book 'Sankara's clarification of certain
Vedantic concepts' there is a Svetasvatara Upanisad reference used in
Sutra Bhashya 2-1-3 'Yattu Darshanamuktam Tatkaranam Sankhya
Yogabhipannamiti' Adi Sankara has said the Sankhya and Yoga are not
the Sankhya and Yoga Disciplines but they are Vedic Jnana and Vedic
Dhyana. 'Vaidikameva Tatra Jnanam Dhyanam Ca'. What is Vaidika Jnana
and Dhyana? The Svetasvatara is saying Tat Karanam Sankhya
Yogadhigamyam Jnatva Devam Mucyate Sarvapashaihi'. It is saying
Sankhya and Yoga practice will give Moksha. But Adi Sankara is saying
that Sankhya and Yoga is Vaidika Jnana and Vaidika Dhyana. I am unable
to understand why he is not accepting Svetasvatara Upanishad direct
meaning.
