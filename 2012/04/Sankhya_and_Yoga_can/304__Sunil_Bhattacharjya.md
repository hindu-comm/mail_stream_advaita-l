Namaste,

At first sight it may appear that Sankhya advocates multiplicity of soul even on liberation but that may not really be be so. One identifies objects as multiples when they have different identities. When the multiple objects escape from prakriiit the multiple identities are also lost. A point to be seriously pondered over. It is probably for this reason that Lord Krishna said that some people can get Mukti from Sankhya jnana itself.


Regards,
Sunil KB

Namaste

In that case what is the meaning of Vaidika Jnana = Sankhya and
Vaidika Dhyana = Yoga? Where is Adi Sankara describing Vaidika Dhyana?
Is it meditation on Brahman?

Sankhya and yoga philosophies subscribe to plurality of jiivas in moksha too. Hence the upanishad statements have to be properly interpreted for samanvayam or consistency - tatttu samanvayaat.
