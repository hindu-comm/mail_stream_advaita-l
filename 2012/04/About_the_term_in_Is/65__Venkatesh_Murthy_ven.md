Namaste Sri Bhaskar Mahodaya

Your name is Bhaskar same as Surya but you are asking why is Surya
important? This is surprising.

In Aruna Prasna we have heard Surya Atma Jagataha Tasthushasca. The
Veda is saying Surya is Atma of all.

Surya is Pratyaksha Brahman only. No need to search for Brahman in
books and Idols. He is visible for everybody to see.

Like there is Atma in our body there is Surya for the Universe. If we
know the Atma in body is Surya in the sky this is highest Jnana.
