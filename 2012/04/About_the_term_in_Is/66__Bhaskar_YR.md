praNAms Sri Venkatesh Murthy prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Your name is Bhaskar same as Surya but you are asking why is Surya
important? This is surprising.

>  I am not asking why sUrya, am asking why ONLY sUrya??  I am happy that 
'my' name appears in sUrya gAyatri, (taitireeya AraNyaka) bhaskarAya 
vidmahe mahadyutikarAya dheemahi tannO AdityaH prachOdayAt :-)) But this 
should not prevent me from asking the question why ONLY sUrya and why not 
others.  You know, I've to be impartial to myself:-)

In Aruna Prasna we have heard Surya Atma Jagataha Tasthushasca. The Veda 
is saying Surya is Atma of all.

>  rigvedeeya & yajurvedeeya saura sUktaM says we have to pray sUrya for 
the nivAraNa of hrudrOgaM (heart diseases)  (hrudrOgaM mama sUrya 
harimANancha nAshaya), that does not mean sUrya is cardiologist :-)) the 
eyes of this jagat gets the light from THAT to illumine this jagat.  He, 
vAyu, agni etc. do their duties according to HIS instruction. 

Surya is Pratyaksha Brahman only. No need to search for Brahman in books 
and Idols. He is visible for everybody to see.

>  I do agree, but subjective attachment to any particulars is not 
recommended in advaita. 

Like there is Atma in our body there is Surya for the Universe. If we know 
the Atma in body is Surya in the sky this is highest Jnana.

>  Yes, if we know the Atma svarUpa, then we would realize that what is 
there in sUrya is there in me also and that is ONE and without second.. 
Rishi vAmadeva's exclamation says the same thing. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
