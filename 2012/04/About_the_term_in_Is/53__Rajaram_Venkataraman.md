In every instance, you are precluding any debate by saying how Sankara
should be interpreted without giving reasons. It is your interpretation of
Sankara and as you conclude that Ishwara is unreal, I am saying that you
belong to Nirishwara Advaitam. (Atheism is not wrong and many good people
are atheists. Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris are good people. They are
better than many religious people who commercialise religion). There are
advaitins who rightly conclude that Brahman = Ishwara = Self. Para Maya
essentially = Ishwara. In my very brief study from Krishnamurthy Sastrigal,
this is what I learnt as his view. Anyway, textual support for this
equation is inedeed strong.

If I point out the logical fallacy of you conclusion, it will be an endless
argument. I should ideally desist but am tempted to quickly point out.

Ishwara = Self and hence = Ruler

How is the inaccessible Brahman known?

Is Ishwara act in any sastra or Sankara's Advaitam? What is the point of
saying that here Sankara talks about Kevala Chaitanyam?

Its "prasada" as opposed to His? You can't ascribe mercy etc. to It.

You asked how there can be a king without a kingdom? I showed the 15 th
chapter reference where Sankaa refers to nirupadhika Brahman as Ishwaranila
- lord by nature. it is correct because rulership comes from being the
Self. The Self (Ishwara) does not cease to be just because the world can
and does.

If there is no sankalpa, then the cause of the world should be pradhana
according to you.

In its essential nature has to be supplied to the Karika?

How do you enjoy with your definition Nirguna Brahman very distinct fom
Saguna Brahman?

The word 'Ishwara' occurring in the BG 18.61 (ईश्वरः सर्वभूतानां

In the two birds verse, you will say both are achit?

I have countless times repeated that Ishwara is transcendental to names and
forms. To your position, does Brahman destroy Naraka? It will become an
actor or the act of realization will become the actor. What is your bhashya
for I was Manu, I was Surya, I am Gopala etc.? There is no destruction
here.
