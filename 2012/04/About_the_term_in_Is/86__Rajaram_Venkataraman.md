Please cross refer 8.22, especially from  ya: bhaktya ... gatadhi. The
Purusha, the cause in who every thing contained, is reached through one
pointed devotion to the Self! As opposed to rejecting Ishwara as anatma
Sankara says Ishwara is the goal reached by devotion to the Self. It is not
the dualistic Ishwara. The goal that you reach is the supreme state of
Vishnu (8.21) or "Ishwaram Sthanam" (8.28). Sankara keeps the context of
who is Vishnu from the beginning of the chapter.

The goal that is reached is the supreme state of Vishnu, Ishwara. If it is
not Turiya, then we should not even aim for it. First, He should do this
meditation on the Immutable and get liberated.

You seemed concerned that the term Parameshwara is missing in this
adhikaranam :) You can satisfy yourself in the next adhikaranam where
Parameshwara is equated to Paramatma.
