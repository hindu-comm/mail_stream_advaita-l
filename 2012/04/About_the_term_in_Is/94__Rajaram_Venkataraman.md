I think the only nature of Ishwara is pure consciousness. From vyavahara,
we think He appears and disappears. This is caused by His para maya,
essentially non-different from Him. He does not become non-Self during His
appearance. He does not become unreal. He does not become non-bliss. It is
not like dualists assigning Him a reality equal to jagat or slightly
higher. She remains absolutely real because pure existence is Her nature.

The true nature of jagat is also Brahman. But the jagat is ultimately
unreal. It is said to be Brahman only because it is an illusion created by
apara maya, which is in reality Ishwara's divine maya, though seen as cause
of samsara. Jiva is Brahman because it is an illusion created within
vyavahara realm by Ishwara's Paramaya, non-different from Him. In the
ultimate state jagat, jivatvam and ishwaratvam in relation to jiva and
jagat will be sublated but Ishwara is not because He is the Self. Paramaya,
which is seen as different from Him, exists as non-different from Him.

I don't think this is what is being said by others because they are talking
about Ishwara becoming anatma and effect of apara maya joining brahman.

Otherwise Brahman will be not be Purnam but Shunyam.

I am happy to be corrected as long as we don't (figuratively) kill Sankara
and Rama - bhashyam and god.
