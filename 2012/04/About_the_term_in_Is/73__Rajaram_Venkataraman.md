We know that Br. Up. states that one who worships the deity thinking I am
one and He is another is like an animal to the deity. By this, it teaches
that one should worship the deity as non-different from the Self and not as
an external object. That will reduce the deity to "idam" or mere "jadam". I
think that it is the same principle that is taught here using niyama and
parisankhya vidhis as indicated by Sankara. How is niyama vidhi applicable
here? In this world, atmatvam is wrongly ascribed to upadhis (forms of
Hiranyagarbha also known by the sabda Ishwara) and this statement  "na
idam" becomes essential to remove that misconception just as the statement
"same yajeta" becomes essential when an ejamana undertakes tharsapurnamsa
yajna in an uneven ground but becomes unnecessary when the ejamana on his
own undertakes the yajna on a level ground. In the same way, "na idam" is
unnecessary when the misconception of ascribing atmatvam to upadhis does
not arise in the first place. It does not mean that we worship with the
conception "I am jadam", "Ishwara is jadam" etc. as that will contradict
the injunction to consider the deity is non-different from the Self. How is
parisankhya vidhi applicable here? By denying brahmatvam to that which is
not pratyagatma, that which is pratyagatma is known as brahmam. By denying
brahmatvam to the deity (Hiranyagarbha) that is not the pratyagatma,
brahmatvam is automaticaly obtained for the deity distinct from it (Avyakto
paro Narayana), that is the pratyagatma. It is not possible to consider
both Narayana and Hiranyagarbha, indicated by the term Ishwara, as idam.
