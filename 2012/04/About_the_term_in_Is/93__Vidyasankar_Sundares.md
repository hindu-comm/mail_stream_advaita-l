But we talk of the objects as different from the energy localized in a field
and we talk of the energy density of a field and fluctuations in the field.

That is where the analogy stops. Because, by definition, brahman is infinite
and admits of no fluctuations. There is no such thing as density of brahman
in ISvara or jIva and there is no such thing as localization of sarva-vyApaka
brahman. So, I can still say God save us if and when the need arises, no
problem.

Perfectly okay, but what is primary to the nature of ISvara? Is it pure
consciousness or the appearing within vyavahAra? If you agree that it
is the former, then your argument is about a distinction without a
difference. The true nature of ISvara is brahman, but the true nature
of jIva is also brahman. That is all that anybody is really saying. If you
also agree that if not for appearing within vyavahAra, it would not be
necessary to even call brahman as ISvara, then I would remind you 
that advaita insists that the nature of paramArtha does not need
anything from vyavahAra, except to exclude it. It is only in that sense
that ISvara-tva is denied (transcended may be a better way of saying
it in English) in paramArtha.
