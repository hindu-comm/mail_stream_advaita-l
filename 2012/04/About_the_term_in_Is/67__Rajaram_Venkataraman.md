God save us! No, lets save God :)

The ocean was crying and running. A student enquired the reason. The oceans
said, "The waves are entering in to me. I will dry up." The student asked,
"How can that be?". The ocean pointed to a professor. The professor said,
"I did not say you will physically dry up but only logically". The student
asked,"How can that be?". The professor said,"The existence of ocean
depends on waves. If there are no waves, there can be no ocean - it is only
water". Though used to exist when no waves do as low tide, the ocean seemed
relieved, "I am water now, which means I will remain as such". The
professor said, "No. You are not water now because you are the ocean".  The
student asked, "How can that be?". The professor replied, "I am the
professor of oceanology". The student asked, "How can that be if oceans
don't exist?"

My serious response inset.

> It is an incorrect representation of the tradition. In pratibimba vada,
the reflection is held to be absolutely real. That is the basis in this
view to say that Isvara and Jiva are one. In abhasa vada, some say, that
the reflection is held to be unreal but I don't think so because even here
the reflection is admitted as consciousness. This does not mean there are
multiple realities but that one reality appears in multiple mediums without
losing its reality.

In BG 8.3, Sankara identifies the supreme Brahman, the Self, with Ishwara.
Sankara says, "Akshara means that which does not perish,the Supreme Self.
This agrees with the Upanishadic text, 'Under the mighty rule of this
Immutable! O Gargi (Br. 3.8.9).'" In 13.3, the Lord is identified with the
Self by Sankara - too long to reproduce here.
