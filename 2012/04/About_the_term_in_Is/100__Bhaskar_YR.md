With jnaani this traid reduces to binary format - aatma -anaatma. 
everything that is not chaitanyam reduces to anaatma - that includes 
everything - good or bad which themselves are at relative level.

I hope the intended meaning of the above vAkya is something different from 
your vAkyArtha.  Here jnAni does not see anything as anAtma, he sees 
everything as Atman only.  If he sees anything as anAtma (even tip of the 
hair) then that avasthA is called avidyAvasthA.  idaM sarvaM yadayamAtma 
says shruti, shankara echoing this says in bhAshya, yattu sarvAtmabhAvAt 
arvAk vAlAgramapi anyatvena drushyate nAhamasmeeti tadavasthA avidyA.  So, 
for the jnAni, there can be nothing that can be called anAtma, for him 
sarvaM Atma mayaM...that is what called samyaK bhAva or samyak darshana in 
advaita.  In that state it is ekameva adviteeyaM. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
