I'm reminded of the words of one of the acharyas of Sringeri(I cannot
remember who exactly it is-maybe Chandrashekara Bharathi) about Surya
as Brahman. A foreigner had asked him a similar question. His reply
was something like this-
The sAligrama is used to worship Vishnu. The Shivalinga is used to
worship Shiva. Although both are made of material perishable over time
they are nevertheless worshipped. Both are the abodes of their
respective gods. Similarily the Surya though being a mass of fire is
the abode of Surya deva.
For those who cannot perceive Brahman as achintya or nirguna the
manifestation as Ishwara is required. But for the mandAdhikari who
cannot perceive Ishwara in his form, he is seen through an object. In
this case the object being the mass of fire, i.e sun.
