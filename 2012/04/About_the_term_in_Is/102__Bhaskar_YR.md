I think there is no niyama that the jnani's dRShTi has to be that way 
alone
as you have said.  Shankara has also said, for example, in the BGB 2.16:
Arjuna, you too, following the dRShTi of the Tattvavits, consider the
transformations in life as mirage water, asadeva sadiva avabhAsate. (the
asat alone appears to be sat) In the BGB 13th chapter too Shankara says
this. And as you know very well, the BGB verses on 'guNaa guNeshu vartante
iti matvA na sajjate', 'indriyANi indriyArtheShu vartanta iti
dhArayan...'.

I think lord's teaching to arjuna is from sAdhaka's sAdhana drushti, 
keeping one of the sAdhana chatushtaya,  nityAnitya vastu viveka which is 
essential part of advaita sAdhana and another is the state of jnAni and 
his 'drushti' towards jagat.  One is instruction and another is 
explanation of jnAni/jnAna lakshaNa.  brahmArpaNam, svapAkecha paNditAH 
verses pertains to jnAna lakshaNa i.e. sarvAtma bhAva saMyak darshana. 
This is what lord clarifies somewhere in geeta, amrutaM chaiva mrutyuscha, 
sad-asdachaa.. in bruhadAraNyaka shankara explains this jnAni state 
beautifully, he says, tadidamapyetarhi ya evaM veda ahaM brahmAsmeeti sa 
idaM sarvaM bhavati.  So, IMHO, former (AtmAnAtma viveka) is 
discrimination that is required in the sAdhana stage, later is the real 
status of the Atma jnAna aka samyaK jnAna. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
