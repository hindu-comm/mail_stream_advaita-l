Namaskarams. But I have to say this.  What you said applies to you
also. "I mention
this as an aside, because the mere occurrence of a word need not mean what
people (no matter how scholarly they are) may think it means." anatma
ishwara refers to cosmic subtle body (Hiranyagarbha) not to parameshwara
who is maya sabalitha brahman. Kadalangudi is no fool to explain these
vidhis in a two page foot note. To write that off without even reading him
is close minded. Interpreting without reference to mimamsa as Sri
Subrahmanian does is wrong.

Please read Ishadhikaranam and BG 8.13 and 8.19 - 21 very very carefully with
an open mind. You will appreciate the clear difference between Parameshwara
(Atma) and Hiranyagarbha (Anatma).

My previous post summarises my position. It leaves no room for dualism and
your position that Ishwara is anatma and abrahman. It just leaves all the
room for Sankara.
