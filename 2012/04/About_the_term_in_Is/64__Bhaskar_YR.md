You are Atma. Like this Surya is pure Brahman.

praNAms Sri Venkatesh Murthy prabhuji
Hare Krishna

You might have heard taitereeya shruti, bhIshAsmA vAtaH pavate, bhIshOdeti 
sUryasya, bhIshAsmAgnischendrascha, mrutyurdhAvati paNchama iti.  etc. Who 
is this sUrya who is obeying the order of THAT and executing his duties in 
fear of that, if he himself is para or pure brahman?? Why not agni or vAyu 
pure brahman?? And if you see Rigvedeeya vAgAMbhruNi sUktaM in saMhita 
(popularly known as devi sUktaM) it says : ahaM mitrA varuNObhA 
bhibharmyahamidrAgnI ahaM ashvinObhA etc. Why do you want to pin point on 
only sUrya when somany other devata-s are propitiated  as parabrahman in 
vedA-s??  Please clarify. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
