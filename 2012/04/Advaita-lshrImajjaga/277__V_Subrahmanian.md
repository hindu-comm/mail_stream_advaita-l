Thank you Sri Ramakrishna ji for the efforts in bringing out the ITRANS
version after several rounds of verification/correction.  The notes are
also apt.  This is a fine stotram composed by the present Jagadguru of the
Sringeri PeeTham, HH Sri Bharati Tirtha MahaswaminaH.  The stotram can be
recited in the manner of the famous 'mudA karAttamodakam ...' of
Shankaracharya:
