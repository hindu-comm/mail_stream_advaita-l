Thank you for passing this information on.
This is a great loss at several levels.
He was my Sanskrit teacher andI heard him almost everyday for 2 years during my pre-university term at National College. I heard him just once after he became a Swami.
My life was greatly enriched by him, he was a teacher of true conviction, and every word he said, and every rebuke he gave us,left a deep impression on us. In fact, I used to write down all the impressive English phrases and examples he gave to chide us, and there were many exemplary ones. Sri Deshikachar (his brother from his pUrvAshrama days) was a great Chemistry teacher. 
I consider myself blessed to be taught by these great souls.
My obeisance to all great teachers. 
Savithri

Swami Rangapriya Mahadesikan, a sannyAsi of the SrivaishNava sampradaya,
passed away this morning at the Ashtanga Yoga mandiram, Hanumantha nagar,
Bangalore, his abode, this morning. *He was a scholar in Sanskrit and was
known as Sri Varada Deshikachar in his pUrvAshrama. * He was the Head of
the Department of Sanskrit at the National College, Bangalore. He had a
very large following consisting of both srivaiShNavas and smarta-s. His
motto was to promote Astikyam among people and under his mArgadarshana a
number of people walk the path of devotion and adhyAtma. His regard for
Shankaracharya is something unique. He used to often quote from the
Shankara bhashyas and has popularised a number of stotras of Shankara
among his disciples/followers. This website gives more information about
the Swami:

It was only yesterday that I was thinking of the Swami and this afternoon I
got to hear about his passing away. Being a resident of the same locality,
I quickly went to the Mandiram and paid my obeisance to the Mahatma. I
heard from the people there that the end was extremely peaceful.

I recall an incident of just two years ago. Sri Rangapriya Swamiji was in
the practice of observing the Shankara Jayanti every year. He would
address his devotees/followers and recount several events from Shankara's
life. An Iyengar neighbour who had gone there brought me prasadam from the
Swamiji.

Such persons leave a great impression in the society by their life, words
and deeds.
