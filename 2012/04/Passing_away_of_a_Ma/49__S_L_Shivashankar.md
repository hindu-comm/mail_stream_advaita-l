The demise of the great Srivaishnava scholar Sri Sri Rangapriya Swami is
indeed a great loss. He was a man of great learning and spiritual
refinement. I have a friend who is a student of the Swamiji, and with him i
once went to SwamijiÂ´s ashram in Hanumantanagar in Bangalore. It was great
to witness the puja, and afterwards I was fortunate to recieve prasadam
from the hands of Swamiji.

It is very true that Sri Sri Rangapriya Swamiji held Adi Shankara in a high
esteem. He used to recite Dakshinamurthy Stotram and other works by
Shankara. He often attended celebrations, functions, book releases and
special occassions at the Sringeri Matha and other institutions connected
to advaita vedanta.

Warmest regards
