Namaste,

vaishAkha shuddha saptami is the birthday of Shri Vidyaranya who
was also the acharya of Sringeri. 

There are certain controversies around this noble soul and 
Some of the historical facts have been distorted by vaishnavas
and madhvas. But the copper plate inscription which is preserved
In Andhra University portray the clear picture of who exactly 
was the Vidyaranya was. 

It cannot also be denied that there are 2 to 3 vidyaranyas by the same
name as there is a laghu shAkta tantra by the name *vidyAraNya tantra*.
Also, there are 2 versions of kali karpura stotra and the last line
Says that *iti shri vidyAraNya muni virachita kAli karpUra stotram
sampUrNaM* which details of certain vamachara rituals. 
So, going by the above lines, Shri Vidyaranya of Sringeri could 
have been different who advocated dakSiNAchAra / samayA 
mArga. 

Going by the historical facts inscribed on the coppers plates, 
the date of birth is vishAkha shuddha saptami and the place of
birth is a brAhmaNa agrahAra by name *mangakApuraM* 
which is near shrisailam and nandyala in the baDaganAdu 
mandalam. 

There lived a grihastha by name *mAyaNa* whose wife was
*shrImati*. Their iSTa devata was Lord Virupaksa of Hampi.
With the blessings of Virupaksheshwara, 3 sons were born to
mAyaNa. 

They were: 1) mAdhava 2) sAyaNa 3) bhOganAtha

Among them, mAdhava and sAyaNa were also sahAdhyAyis 
And learnt shAstras under *shankarAnanda* at kAnchipuram.
*vidyAtIrtha* was the birudAvaLi of shri shankarAnanda. 

Now, some of the people cooked up some stories that Shri Vedanta
Desika was also a sahAdhyAyi of Shri Vidyaranya which according
to the copper plate is wrong. 

Also the vAda-prativAda between Akshobhya Tirtha and Vidyaranya 
Tirtha which the madhvAs claim is also a fabricated story.

Meanwhile, with the death of the king pratapa rudra of kakatiya 
dynasty, the king Prolaya Nayaka gets demoralized. Shankarananda
teaches the kshatriya dharma to the king which acts as a morale 
booster. Meanwhile, Shankarananda also imbibes the dEsa-bhakti
into these young brahmacharis mAdhava & sAyaNa. 

Shankarananda make them aware of the mission of 
*vEda uddharaNa* and *sanAtana dharma rakSaNa*
which was wobbling with the mleccha rule. 

Both bid farewell to the shankarAnanda. mAdhava take en-route 
to Virupaksa of Hampi and performs Bhuvaneshwari Upasana.
He takes vidwat sanyAsa and proceeds to Sringeri and 
assumes the yOga paTTa *vidyAraNya* under Bharati Krishna. 

Subsequently, converts harihara & bukka raya brothers into hindu fold
and establishes *vijayanagara*. Interestingly, the day on which
Vijayanagara Kingdom was established is also *vaishAkha mAsa
shukla pakSa saptami tithi ravivAsara makhA nakSatra*.

Father = mAyaNa belonged to bhAradwAja gOtra & bOdhAyana sUtra
Mother = shrImati

Sons of mAyaNa = mAdhava (eldest also called vidyAraNya), sAyaNa & bhOganAtha

b) mAyaNa = second son of sAyaNa ;a great poet
c) singaNa = third son of sAyana and a great vedic scholar
