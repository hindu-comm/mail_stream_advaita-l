Namaste,

In fact some people think that Madhava (who wrote the Sankara-Vijaya and Swami Vidyaranya may not be the same person. I also read somewhere that the Sankara-Vijaya could have been written about two centuries after passing away of Swami Vidyaranya. Of course, these are historical issues and the Sringeri math may not bother about such issues.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Subject: [Advaita-l] shri vidyAraNya jayanti - a remembrance

Namaste,

///

The pancadasi text was supposed to have been written half by Vidyaranya and half by Bharati Tiirtha. There may be lot of mix up in these details - not sure which is authentic

//

Whether shri bhArati tirtha and sAyaNa are one and the same is also a debatable issue. 

As you said, it is also said that panchadasi was written by both vidyAraNya & bhArati tirtha. Some scholars are of the view that the original name of panchadasi was *brahmAnanda* because vidyAraNya hints by saying that *brahmAnandaM pravakSyAmi..*. Commenting on this, shrI rAmakriSNa paNDita says that
*brahmAnandAbhidhaM granthaM vyAkarvE bOdhasiddhayE*. 

Some of the great scholars in Andhra Pradesh like Prof. S.S.Suryanarayana Sastry,
Shri D.V.Gundappa, Shri Vemparala Suryanarayana Sastry, Shri Gadiyaram Ramakrishna Sarma have done extensive research of the life & history of mAdhava-vidyAraNya based on
the copper plate inscriptions available in Andhra University.

Many of the myths around vidyAraNya that he was defeated by madhva scholar akSObhya tirtha etc. etc. is just a myth only. 

Frankly speaking, the vidyAraNya didn't have enough time for debates etc. as his mission 
was vEda-mata saMrakSaNa, sanAtana dharma uddharaNa. He was a 2nd shankara who
incarnated for a particular mission. Accomplished it. 

Mission Accomplished !!!!
