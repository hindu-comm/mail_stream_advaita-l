Namaste,

///

The pancadasi text was supposed to have been written half by Vidyaranya and half by Bharati Tiirtha. There may be lot of mix up in these details - not sure which is authentic

//

Whether shri bhArati tirtha and sAyaNa are one and the same is also a debatable issue. 

As you said, it is also said that panchadasi was written by both vidyAraNya & bhArati tirtha. Some scholars are of the view that the original name of panchadasi was *brahmAnanda* because vidyAraNya hints by saying that *brahmAnandaM pravakSyAmi..*. Commenting on this, shrI rAmakriSNa paNDita says that
*brahmAnandAbhidhaM granthaM vyAkarvE bOdhasiddhayE*. 

Some of the great scholars in Andhra Pradesh like Prof. S.S.Suryanarayana Sastry,
Shri D.V.Gundappa, Shri Vemparala Suryanarayana Sastry, Shri Gadiyaram Ramakrishna Sarma have done extensive research of the life & history of mAdhava-vidyAraNya based on
the copper plate inscriptions available in Andhra University.

Many of the myths around vidyAraNya that he was defeated by madhva scholar akSObhya tirtha etc. etc. is just a myth only. 

Frankly speaking, the vidyAraNya didn't have enough time for debates etc. as his mission 
was vEda-mata saMrakSaNa, sanAtana dharma uddharaNa. He was a 2nd shankara who
incarnated for a particular mission. Accomplished it. 

Mission Accomplished !!!!
