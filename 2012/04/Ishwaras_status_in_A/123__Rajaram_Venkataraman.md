The popular view held by even a well read scholar such as yourself was that
Ishwara's form is pancha bautika. I pointed out that it is not
pancha-bautika according to Madhusudana. If Madhusudana or Sridhara says it
is Saguna Brahman, then will it change popular opinion? Even quoting
Sankara won't help because traditional belief has a strong influence on our
mind.

Try telling a Christian that evolution theory is as true as saying earth is
a sphere.
