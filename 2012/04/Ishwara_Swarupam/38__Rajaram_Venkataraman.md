I did not mean avyakta means immutable. I meant avyakta, the unmanifest is
akshara, the immutable. In my understanding, avyakta can refer to the
sleeping state of Hiranyagarbha and also Brahman. Immutable       can also
refer to both. Right?

Why do you say avyakta is insentient? I think it is the basis of both
sentient and insentient whether it is used to refer to apara brahman or
para. Is it used to refer to pradhana?

In SB 5.1.13, avyakta dishtam meaning directed by avyakta is used.
