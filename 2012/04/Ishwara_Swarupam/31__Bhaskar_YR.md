praNAms
Hare Krishna

I am not referring to a particular manifestation within vyavahara such as
lakshmipati. I am using tha names such as Narayayana, Vasudeva etc. 
because
sastras use them and so does Sankara. I am specifically referring to
Nirupadhika Naryana that Sanara talks about in Chapter 15.

prabhuji, in that case he is NOT ONLY nArAyaNa, he is aNu, bruhat, krusha, 
stUla, uttara, pUrva, pashchima, dakshiNa and what not??  svetAshvatara 
maNtra tvaM stree, tvaM pumAmsi explains this beautifully.

sattva as Sankara explains. Right?

>> who is sOphAdhika brahman here??  vAsudeva or vaishvAnara??  vAsudeva

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
