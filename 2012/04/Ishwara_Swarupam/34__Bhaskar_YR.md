After saying that I am the light in sun, vaishvanara etc., the lord says
He is different from the mutable and immutable in 15.17. So, I think that
vaishvanara is apara. He is said to be one based on aikya jnana. Right?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Yes prabhuji, point to be noted here is  though this parApara prakruti is 
none other than  vAsudeva (parabrahman, hence ahaM vaishvAnara) 
parabrahman is devoid of all these.  Thus purushOttama is beyond the 
kshara ( kArya rUpa) akshara ( the kAraNa)...This reminds me lalita 
sahasranAma, kArya-kAraNa nirmukta kAma keli tarangita..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
