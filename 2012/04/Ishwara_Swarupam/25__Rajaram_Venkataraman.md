Sankara clearly says that Narayana, who is beyond Hiranyagarbha and Avyakta
is nirupadhika. Therefore He is paramartika. His maya is non-different from
Him and therefore not an upadhi. Please let me know if you think this is
wrong and if so why.

Any vedic conception of Him as Vaishnavara, Surya etc. is due to
vishishtopadhi. It is saguna and sopadhika. It is not paramartika.
