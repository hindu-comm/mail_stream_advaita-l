> As shishya jana of Sripadaraja mutt at mulubhagalu (on
> bangalore-chennai highway near the state border), we have seen the
> ankAra narasimha painted by Sri Akshobya Teertharu.  Also, my brother
> has visited this hillock with the sthambha and described it as noted
> in the text.  i donot think it is mentioned that sri vidhyaranya  was
> the peetathipathi and mahaswamin.  the name appears to be teh same; at
> the same time  i have not read the moola granthAs of dvaita and
> vishisthAdvaita schools that have chronicled this.
