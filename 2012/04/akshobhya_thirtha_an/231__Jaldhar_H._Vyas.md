This has come up on the list before but I don't recall a firm conclusion. 
What sounds fishy about it to me is that a vishishtadvaitin would have 
just as much object to the Dvaita understanding of Tattvamasi as an 
Advaitin would he not?

Supposedly this verdict is inscribed on a commemorative stone edict at the 
place where the debate occurred.  The sources on the net which tell this 
story mention the inscription but none seem to have seen it first hand. 
Have any list members who are familiar with the area seen it?
