The Mulabagal debate between Akshobhya theertha and Vidhyaranya,dvaita
followers
claim to be defeat for Vidhyaranya and advaita.I am interested to know what
was the
actual verdict from Vedanta Desika?My understanding is he only gave the
verdict as''
with the sword of Tatvamasi,Akshobhyathirtha pierced the forest of
Vidhyaranya''.
