The entire stotra collection that is part of this 'pArAyaNa' is available
here for hearing/downloading:

http://www.vedantabharati.com/index/uop/shankara-stava-maalaa

This one stotra is available on the sringeri mutt website, in Devanagari.
If someone can convert it to ITRANS it is fine.  I think conversion tools
are available:

The rest I shall intimate as and when I find them.

Q: Also in reference to the five days, is it from Vaishaka shukla pratipada
to panchami or panchami to navami or something else?

Reply: The start is on 22nd of April and culminating on 26th (Jayanthi Day).
