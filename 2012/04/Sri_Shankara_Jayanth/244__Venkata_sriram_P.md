Namaste,

///

The procedure also mentions shodashopachara puja to Shankaracharya. What is the mantra for this or is it just the same as in regular puja? (purusha sukta etc.)

//

Shankaracharya Puja Paddhati that is followed in Sringeri can be downloaded from here:

If one doesn't know the elaborate rituals as prescribed above, a simple shodashopachara puja with purusha suktam and rudra parayana can be done. For ashtottara namavali, any 
three can be adopted shankaracharya ashtottara / dakshinamurty ashtottara / shiva ashtottara. 

Also,vaisakha shuddha saptami is celebrated as vidyAraNya jayanti. 

BTW, the best way to celebrate sankara jayanti is to study prasthAna traya bhASya 
rather than doing ashtottara / sahasranama pujas. 

regs,
sriram
