Namaste Sri Rajaram

There is Soma Yaga with animal sacrifice and Soma drinking. I heard
from elders this Soma Yaga is compulsory for Brahmana with Agnihotra.
In the Spring he must perform Soma Yaga with animal sacrifice and
drink Soma.

There is no sin in Soma Yaga with animal sacrifice but some do it
without animals also. The Soma drink is also intoxicating but it is
not sin like drinking Alcohol.

There is also Scientific Angle. Nowadays the environment is so
polluted. If we eat animal meat it is dangerous because the animal has
eaten very bad and polluted things like rubbish on the streets or lot
of chemicals and artificial food. In olden days the animal was eating
only good things. The animals were going to forest for eating nice
herbs and plants. It is safe to eat the Organically fed animals.

None of the daily and mandatory ones do. So, there is no room for animal killing for just satisfying the tongue.
