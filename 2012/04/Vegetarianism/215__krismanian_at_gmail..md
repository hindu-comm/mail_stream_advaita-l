I have not seen a sane reply to Mr. Rajaram's discussions on why mass  
killing and abuse of animals is unethical thing to do.
I am so disillusioned to read the right wing replies. After all Buddha  
refined the vedic religion and brought the Ahimsa concept to Vedic religion
and paved the way to stopping mass sacrifices of animals in Yagnas.  
Shankara refined it more. You guys are now reverting back to the  
barbarianism that was. It is unthinkable.
