Dear friends,


Even in the yajnas the offering of meat was introduced only by the hypocrites (obviously to get a license for eating meat in a round-about way) as stated by Bhishma in the Mahabharata. Of course in the Pitrikarya the offer of meat was sanctioned.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Namaste

Brahmins were probably meat eaters in olden days. But there is strong
prohibition of cow meat in Smrutis and Sruti also. The Sruti has
called the cow as Aghnya. This says Brahmins were eating other animal
meat but not cow meat in Kali Yuga. But nowadays even other meat is
contaminated because of polluted environment an polluted food eaten by
the animal. For this reason also and health reasons like high
cholesterol and fat the Brahmins must not eat any meat now. Only
exceptions may be in Yajnas. But even in Yajnas Brahmins will take a
minute quantity and swallow it without touching it with the tongue.
