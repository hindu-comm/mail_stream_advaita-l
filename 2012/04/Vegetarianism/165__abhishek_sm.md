Pranams to all list members,

I know this is a bit out of context but i need opinions of learned list
members.

Brahmins always consume vegetarian food and refute from consumption of
meat,etc on the grounds of ahimsa.
I was recently questioned by a friend-"If killing animals is a sin and is
himsa then what about killing of plants? Don't we cut the plant to get
rice?"
I was unable to give a satisfactory answer to this question. Hope our list
members could give me some valuable opinions.

Regards,
Abhishek Madhyastha
