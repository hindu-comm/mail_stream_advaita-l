Namaste

It is correct to say meat eating is allowed in Yajnas than meat eating
in secret. Many people say meat eating is bad in open discussion but
in private life they take meat when nobody is watching. But god is
watching.  We should not have hypocrisy. Some students are not eating
meat at home because the parents are veg but they secretly go to
MCDonald and KFC to have chicken. This is bad. But the man who has
correct knowledge will not behave like this. Parents should not
suppress curiousity and desire of meat by children. Instead of that
suppression they should give correct picture of Hindu view of
vegetarianism. Hindu view is not against meat in Yajnas.
