Even muslims chant their mantras when they kill and eat only Halal meat.

But here you are, who claims to be a vaidhika, who says that animals can be brutally slaughtered without chanting mantras in a vedic yajna. And calls me a buddhist! You can't show one mandatory paka yajna where animals are killed and hence your argument is shunya. But I won't call you a Buddhist because they will feel disgraced - at least they follow their tradition.

dharma is defined by shAstra-s and not by some one else. You know the cause
because you were a part of apauruSheyatva-discussion.
Again, meaning of shAstra-s is determined very well by mImAMsaka-s.
The conclusion is that vaidika-hiMsA and any other hiMsA which is supported
by smR^iti-texts is not adharma at all.
So, the nature of dharma is not to 'not destroy lives' or 'to save lives'.
It's nature is that 'it is defined by veda-s and smR^iti-s, etc.'
It is also very clear that hiMsA has basis in shAstra. It is here that
we(vaidika-s) are different from bauddha-s.
If you are supporting bauddha-matam of ahiMsA, then better understand our
differences.
