I agree that :
one should refrain from hiMsA as much as possible,
and,
even non-veg hindus consider veg as superior
only because
bhagavAn manu says :
न मांसभक्षणे दोषो न मद्ये न च मैथुने ।
प्रवृत्तिरेषा भूतानां निवृत्तिस्तु महाफला ॥

and bhagavAn vyAsa in bhAgavatam :
लोके व्यवायामिषमद्यसेवा नित्यास्तु जन्तोर्न हि तत्र चोदना ।
व्यवस्थितिस्तेषु विवाहयज्ञसुराग्रहैरासु निवृत्तिरिष्टा ॥

So, again we are following shAstra-s.

We are not against ahiMsA proposed by rAjArAma or PETA, we are saying that :
defining hiMsA and ahiMsA according to shAstra is safer
and
definition of rAjArAma doesn't stand tests.

Moreover, his counting the number of yaGYa-s with and without hiMsA is
obviously not a good answer. So, he was opposed.
