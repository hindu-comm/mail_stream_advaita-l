Dear Abhishek,

             I am exactly not sure if "ahimsa" is the only reason of
brahmins not consuming meat / non vegetarian food.

             Recently, I was also discussing about this (specifically
with respect to Beef eating, though) with a few friends, and a friend
mentioned a book called "The myth of the holy cow" by an Indian
historian named D.N.Jha, which talks about beef-eating prevalent
during vedic times.  I have not read the book, but only the reviews,
which tell me that it is a very well researched book. Interestingly,
to get an objective view of the same, I searched for any other book
which counters the claims made in the book, but sadly found none. This
book is in my reading list, and if you get your hands on this book,
please do read this.

            If any other members in this group have read that book,
please do share your thoughts too...

Hope this helps,
--Jayasimha
