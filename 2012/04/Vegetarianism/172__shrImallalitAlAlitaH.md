That supports shAstrIya definition of hiMsA.

It's not a poll booth where we count votes. So, number of yaGYa-s which
involve or not is not important at all.

 We will reform UK and then come to UP :)

Actually, there is a work by vishvanAtha pa~nchAnana which is named -
mAMsatattvavivekaH. It supports eating non-veg and is based on
dharma-shAstra-s, itihAsa, purANa, etc. It was written to refute south
indian view that no hindu(esp. brAhmaNa-s) should eat mAMsa. People of
mithilA and ba~NgAla still follow shAstra-s in this respect. People of
kAshI are not too different and so they eat mAMsa, etc.
Your social reform is definitely not a shAstrIya one. So, shAstrIya people
don't need them.
And, you will be unable to reply to objections of common people, as that of
abhishek's friend.
So, you must try some reforms to your views.
