It is obvious. An act which causes pain is himsa. There is inadvertent

I am not opposed to shAstrIya definition on ahimsa. You don't need shastras
to define what is himsa. If I slap you, we will know it is himsa. We don't
need dharma shastras to tell us that. We need dharma shastras only to tell
us when himsa is allowed.

People eat meat because it satisfies their tongue. If someone tells that
sastras allow that, they will accept it because it makes them feel less
guilty. The instruction of Lord Krishna and Sankara in this matter is
crystal clear. Are the people who are eating meat performing yajna
according to Kalpa sutras? We know they don't and as per our sastras they
verily eat sin. They will suffer the karmic reaction. Those of you who
 mislead the ignorant using the respect that your position as a brahmana or
sannyasi gets you.

If the grace of Ishwara can bring about change in the UK, have no doubts
that it will change UP. If at all you get mamsa as bhiksha, please start
training your tongue to accept rice, roti, dhal etc. Kashi is on the radar
for change.
