I am glad that you want to explore this in Singapore la :)

I am ccing the group because your enthusiasm will give hope to others who
want to do selfless service to protect the cows and animals slaughtered for
food.

If you don't already worship go, please start performing go puja at
Srinivasa or Murugan temple there.  You can also start doing go-seva in
India (e.g. amrtodhara goshala or govindapuram or vrindavan). This will
give you the atma balam to achieve your dharmic goal.

I will advise you on practical steps.
