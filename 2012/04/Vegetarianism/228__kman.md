I am sorry but I couldn't answer those questions. However I'll make my
point clear:

One can have an opinion about what is right and what is wrong. But for a
hindu, Vedas are the ultimate guide. Whoever thinks vedas might have little
flaws here and there, might be termed as 'svecha-chari'(one who acts upon
own will). However, It is not the vedas which has defects, but Karma. This
idea of perfection will be shattered every now and then for wannabe
rationalists. Krishna says in geeta, every action is mingled with flaw
arjuna, like fire with smoke. So the one who seeks perfection, complete
ahimsa, shall renounce the world and seek perfection.
>>
You are tying yourself in to knots. If action is mingled with flaws,
and Vedas say to perform (action) animal sacrifice, that is flawed
also. So Vedas are flawed then!!

Are you going to follow Krishna or Vedas?

But it is Pratyaksha and you know it in your heart that killing an
animal for your
selfish needs is immoral, unethical. We do not need Veda to come and justify it.

To reach brahman you need compation and when you kill or profess to
kill you do not have any compassion, any amount of reading upanishads
and Shankara will not help. Bakti has no place where there is no
compation.
