To say none of them does yaGYa needs sarvaGYatvam.

Even higher goods are for self and so are selfish in nature. Anything which
is prescribed in veda-s and has a phala needs a adhikArI and adhikArI is
that which has phala-kAmanA essentially. So, any yaGYa including
prANAgnihotra is selfish in nature. Then why to hate eating meat ?

OK. It's justified now.
Moreover, how could any person, having understanding of shAstra-s, show you
anything as you are not counting their words at all.

When you are not bothered about pain arising from your words, why should I
bother about killing of animals which supported by veda-s and opposed by
you.
I never said that 'mass slaughter' is vaidika or avaidika. I just said that
eating meat has basis in smR^iti-s and killing animals at places is
supported by both veda-s and smR^iti-s.

Anyway, I give up here. Best wishes for your studies and debates.
