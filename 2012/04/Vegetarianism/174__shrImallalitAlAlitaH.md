This definition is not going to solve problems which were posed by
abhishek's friend. So, one must find some better definition.

Only slapping happens barely. It has always some background and that plays
a part to determine hiMsA. See examples provided by vidyAsha~Nkara.

To your surprise you must know that even nitya and naimittika karma has
adhikArI, etc. So having adhikArI, etc. can't prove vaidika-hiMsA 'bad'.
Moreover, if you accept veda-s as pramANa for nitya-karma-s, you must also
do same in the case of kAmya-karma, etc. for both are prescribed by the
same veda-s. So, either accept both type of vaidika-yaGYa-s as good, i.e,
prAmANika and hence conducive to good OR shun the validity of veda-s in
case of nitya-karma-s too as it prescribes 'bad' karma-s.

That's correct.
But, that is definitely not the single cause.

So, do you want to say that whatever not fits your definition is a bad part
of shAstra OR the whole shAstra is bad ?
OR, Do you want to say that vAkya-s supporting mAMsa-bhaXaNa doesn't exist
at all ?

The instruction of Lord Krishna and Sankara in this matter is crystal clear.


sha~Nkara and kR^iShNa were not dealing with mAMsa-bhaxaNa in bhAShya or
gItA. So, how could you say that their view is crystal clear in this
respect ?
Rather, they were talking of validity of hiMsA which comes from veda-s and
smR^iti-s.


> Are the people who are eating meat performing yajna according to Kalpa
> sutras?


Yes. Do you think only vegetarian people know shAstra-s ?

We know they don't and as per our sastras they verily eat sin.


Many are not included in 'We'.
Don't call 'our shAstra', because you are following PETA. Say our PETA.
Again, those people are eating mAMsa allowed by shAstra-s. So, they are not
eating any sin.

Without studying shAstra-s with a competent guru and without a mind ready
to learn you can't expect to know many things.

May Ishvara provide logical support to you too !!

Every word reveals your identity. Be careful.
