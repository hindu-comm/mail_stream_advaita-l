First of all define hiMsA, both of you, rAjArAm and shrI V subrahmanian.
Why ?
Because we need to determine that you are talking about same hiMsA.
Only then your different views will get success in marking the impression
that you both are in conflict. Otherwise, it appears that you both have
different versions of hiMsA, one decided by shAstra-s and other by PETA,
etc.

It is possible only if both versions of hiMsA are different.

If the war is righteous, then you are yourself saying that pain and killing
are justified.

Those all support hiMsA as defined by shAstra-s.
What about your version ?

You mean PETA-vegans, isn't it ?
