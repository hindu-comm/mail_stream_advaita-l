I think that no one can give better solution than the one provided by shrI
V Subrahmanian.
Leaving shAstra-s aside will not help to get a solution.
If your friend knows shAstra-s OR atleast have shraddhA, i.e.
prAmANikatva-buddhi, in them , then tell him the solution. Otherwise, leave
him with his doubt and get it solved for you with the help of shAstra-s.
