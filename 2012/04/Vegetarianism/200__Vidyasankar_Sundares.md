Rajaram, if you are satisfied that a Puja was done before growing the rice
and vegetables that you buy in your local grocery store in the UK, great. If
you think that this somehow grants you superior credentials to talk about
dharma, as compared to countless generations of Bengali Brahmanas who
may have eaten fish on a regular basis, or others who may have eaten
meat, you are welcome to your opinions. Just don't expect that all others
have to agree. After all, you are the one who does not need SAstra to tell
you what is right and wrong; it is all very clear to you! Others want one or
more reference points in history and tradition.

That said, I give up. This is officially the last time I respond to anything you
have to say. If ever I respond to something you post in future, please feel
free to point to this email and tell me to go away. 

Thanks too for the quite unnecessary reminder about attachment to the list.
Yes, as a moderator, I have a duty to keep discussion threads on track, but
rest assured, I am under no illusions that this is "my" list.

Best wishes for your pursuits,
Vidyasankar

> If I say that raso vai sah is the mantra to chant when you eat rasam :), you can argue that I am making flippant remarks. I am asking you to protect dharma whose purpose is to nurture not destroy lives indiscriminately for selfish gains in the name of custom and without sastric basis. If you don't understand the dharma point being made by me, you should spare the list of your posts giving up any sense of attachment that this is my list and I am the moderator.

> To your point, there are pujas done even today when you plant vegetables, harvest etc. So, we don't need to chant specific mantras for eating vegetables etc. For animal sacrifices, as you must know, there are specific rules on what mantras to chant when you kill, who should eat what part etc. So, it is fair to ask you to tell me the yajna to kill fish. Kanchi Mahaperiyava specifically says that brahmins did not eat meat but only pea nut size from yajnas.
