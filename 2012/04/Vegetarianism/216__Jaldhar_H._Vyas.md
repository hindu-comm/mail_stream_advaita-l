You have achieved the remarkable feat of making an error in every 
single sentence of your post.  You might be comfortable with such 
sloppiness elsewhere but on an Advaita Vedanta list it will not do.  After 
all error and delusion are the most unethical things an Advaitin can be 
involved with are they not?  Nobody is reverting to anything.  Go back and 
read the thread again and you'll see that what we were trying to do is 
place the practice of vegetarianism in its proper dharmic context.  If you 
think placing truth over emotion is "right wing" there is something wrong 
with you.
