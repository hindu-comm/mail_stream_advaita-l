Please read again if interested. I was trying to bring out the complexity
of form, formless, indeterminate form, form of formless and formlessness of
form even with respect to entities within five elements. Let us keep it
simple. We dont know have experience of any entity which is formless. So,
when you say Ishwara is formless, what meaning can the word formless
communicate to you? If you had no experience of sweetness in life, what
will you understand if someone says sugar is sweet?
