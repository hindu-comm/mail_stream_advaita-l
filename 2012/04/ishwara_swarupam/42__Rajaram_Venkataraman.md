which have a form. The mind is also able to assume the form of an object of
perception. Space is formless but when reflected in water, it reveals its
form which is different from the form of the reservoir. That is why you
perceive depth etc. (ref. siddhanta bindu).

So, what you are saying when you say Ishwara is formless, you are indeed
saying He is beyond forms and formlessness. Otherwise, you would have just
said He is formless like the space.
