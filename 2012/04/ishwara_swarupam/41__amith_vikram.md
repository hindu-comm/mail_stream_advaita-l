You said formlessness is an attribute of objects from which you derived
form of formlessness. In that case, an object simultaneously has a form and
is also formless which is absurd.

When I say Ishwara is formless, I mean to say that Ishwara is not an object
of perception, like sugar. However, when someone says sugar is sweet, I'll
have some sugar and then I'll have an experience of sweetness, since it's
an object of perception.
