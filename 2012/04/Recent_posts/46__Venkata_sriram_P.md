Namaste,

Unless such a person has unlearned the wrong stuff, it would be futile to teach him/her anything.

These *baggages* are called vartamAna pratibandhAs. Shri Vidyaranya in *dyAnadIpa-prakaraNa* says:

pratibandhO vartamAnO viSayAsakti lakSaNaH
prajnAmAndyaM kutarkascha viparyadurAgraH

The vartamAna pratibandha includes vishaya asakti, manda buddhi, kutarka vAda,
vitaNDa vAdana etc. 

The subsequent sloka advices us how to remove this vartamAna pratibandha with
shama-damAdi shaTka and shravaNa, manana & nidhidhyAsana under competent
achArya.

regs,
sriram
