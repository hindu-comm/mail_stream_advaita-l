Kindly excuse me for sending the personal mail. 

On 14th April I'm with my family (wife & 2 kids) leaving to Shirdi. Return 
ticket booked on 20th from Sholapur.  We are planning to visit places like 
Nasik,  Shani singaapura, trayamakeshwara, panchavati, ajanta, ellora, 
krishneshwar, pandharpur etc. Could any prabhuji suggest me anything with 
regard to boarding & lodging, local travel agents etc. to make my trip 
trouble free. 

Kindly do respond to my personal ID : bhaksar.yr at in.abb.com.

Thanks in advance.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
