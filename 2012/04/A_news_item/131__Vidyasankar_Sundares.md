It won't prevent others from misusing them, because that genie is already
out of the bottle and you can't put it back. However, it will inform, at a very
deep level, how we respond to such misuse. The only thing I would blame
ourselves for is a failure to truly understand what our own texts mean.

Thanks for the compliment, although I don't know if I have any one solution,
except to state that each one of us needs to have our own solutions. 

The first two steps  for all these solutions, is to develop a sufficient knowledge
base and confidence in our own heritage, to be able to turn the conversation
around; to move on from being the objects studied by modern academic
disciplines, instead becoming those doing the studies, whether within the
modern disciplines or outside of them.
