My immediate reaction to this was the importance of sampradAya in what 
lessons we
learn from difficult texts of philosophy. Of course, any true vedAntic 
teacher would have
sent back Hitler and Himmler with a solid admonition to develop basic 
adhikAra before
even venturing to read the gItA.

Yes, it is very important that one should get the teachings of our sacred 
scriptures under the able guidance of orthodox / bona fide traditional 
teacher.  But IMHO, the 'saMskAra' of the outside individual reader also 
plays an important role in reaping the benefits of his/her reading & 
interpretation.  I heard that though Japanese do not belong to any 
saMpradAya, they have been adopting the teachings of geeta very 
effectively in their social & economic routines & administration.  This 
shows they have 'saMskAra' to understand the intricacies of geeta in a 
right way.  OTOH, the socalled saMpradAyavAdin's interpretations of geeta 
distorted the very essence of this smruti text, as we can see in 'as it 
is'.
