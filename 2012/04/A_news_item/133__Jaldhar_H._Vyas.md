One other thing I would like to add is that Hitlerism was only the most 
extreme variant of a way of thinking that was considered quite respectable 
by educated people of all political stripes in those days.  And Hindus 
were quite eager to embrace the same to prove how "scientific" their 
religion was.  Nowadays there are people who latch onto quantum physics 
etc. to demonstrate "scientific" Hinduism.  In a 100 years time will we 
look at them as we do the "Aryans?"  Better to leave scientific theories 
to rise and fall on their own merits and practice dharma on its own 
merits.
