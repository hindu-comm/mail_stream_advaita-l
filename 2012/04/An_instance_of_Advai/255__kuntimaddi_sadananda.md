The world is neither real or unreal - that is what is referred to as mithyaa. sat asat vilakshNam. If jnaani cannot see the world, it is about the time he has get an appointment with his opthamologist as something wrong with his eyes or with his eye-sight. Jnaana kshakshu is different from physical eye and phisological funtions. It requires wisdom-eye or viveka to see the oneness that pervades the apparent duality. Then only he is a jnaani not when his physical eye stops seeing duality. 

I agree with Subbuji that not understanding advaita properly and making comments pervades lot of dvaita and vishiShTaadvaita literature, and is also obvious in these posts too. Not understanding is not a problem but misunderstanding and claiming that is what advaita says is bigger problem. It requires lot more unlearning before real learning can take place, since one has already concluded and therefore not open to learning.

Hari Om!
