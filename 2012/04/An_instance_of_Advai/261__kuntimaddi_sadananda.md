Sunilji - Mithyaa does not involve confusion. Confusion comes from error which is adhyaasa when mithyaa is taken as satyaa. A jnaani recognizes the world is mithyaa - jagat mithyaa as one of the three dictates of adviata vedanta -while ajnaani assumes that jagat is satyaa. Here it is not confusion but ignorance of the fact.  

Jagat exists as it is as existence is the very basis or foundation or as sloka 5 of ch. 7 that we discussed says - para prakRiti - idam jagat dhaaryate. Jnaani recognizes this fact after Vedanta shravanam while ajnaani operates taking the world as satya and suffers as a consequence of that lack of understanding. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
