The conclusion of top ranking Advaita scholars who regularly interact with
Dvaita/vishishtadvaita scholars is that both these schools, right from
their inception, have not understood Advaita correctly.  Their objections
reveal their poor level of understanding of Advaita.  One can see that
Shankara Himself has raised a number of objections (against Advaita) in the
bhashyas and answered them already and what these schools now object to
are pretty nothing new.

Lists dedicated to Advaita cannot accommodate those who have in them the
only goal of attacking Advaita.  There is nothing wrong if Advaitins,
however, point out the non-Advaitins' wrong understanding of the Advaita
shastra.  They should know that their criticism of Advaita is founded on
their erroneous understanding of Advaita.
