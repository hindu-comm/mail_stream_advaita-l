The PanchadashI (6.130) of Swami Vidyaranya) says:

tuchChAnirvachanIyA cha vAstavI chetyasau tridhA .

j~neyA mAyA tribhirbodhaiH shrautayauktikalaukikaiH .. 130..

[130. Maya is looked upon in three ways. From the point of view of
knowledge and Shruti it is non-existent; for empirical reason it is
indefinable and for the ordinary people it is real.]
