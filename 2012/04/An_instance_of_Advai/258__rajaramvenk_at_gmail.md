I don't know if you or Sri Sadananda does but I get regulatory notice from the moderator if I exceed number of posts which is inevitable if there are so many responses. If I have to conserve my posts I would rather focus on the foundation - dharma. I don't think you can understand Sankara as long as you implicitly support selfish slaughter of animals for food, dress etc. with no regard to the regulations prescribed in the vedic yajnas.

Could you pl. quote Shankara's sentences to the efect that satyasankalpa,
etc. pertains to the nirupAdhika Brahman?

Again, quote Shankara's sentences to substantiate your view.  I have also
pointed out that in BG 8th chapter the word avyakta occurs twice in one
verse with two different meanings: one as anAtmA and the other as Brahman.

Seeing the distinction between the body and soul is the core of Vedanta
sadhana.  The whole of BG 13th chapter is about this.  In fact the very
first verse starts with this declaration.  Pl. get your basics right.

All completely wrong ideas.  Pl. do not confuse the members here.

The teaching about the sthitaprajna is about how the Jnani stands insulated
from delusion and sorrow despite being exposed to their possibility.  pl.
study the second chapter of BG with the bhashya.

It is 'seeing' (not ocular perception) the underlying reality that is what
is being aware of this reality.  Shankara says in the 13th chapter: asadeva
sadiva avabhAsate:  That which is non-existent alone appears as though
existing.  If only you go through the several quotations from the Bhashya
that I have provided in this thread you will  understand how far from the
reality is your understanding.  Especially see the one from BSB 4.1.15
where Shankara talks about the co-existence of the body along with the
experience of Self-realization.  Then you will realize the error in your
comments.
