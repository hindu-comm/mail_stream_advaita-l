Please first understand what is form and formless in clear terms. And make up your mind on whether space and mind are formless or not. Then you will be clear what you mean when you say Ishwara is formless. And what I mean when I say He is beyond forms and formless.

In that case we will have to differentiate 'me' from 'my mind' and when we
try to do that we realize that mind cannot exist independently without
'me'. Then that would ultimately lead to the conclusion, the 'I' is
formless which i am not denying.

??? Does this mean space is formless but then it has a form?

Since we are defining Ishwara assuming it to be seperate from the one who
is defining, we can say that Ishwara is formless like space. That doesn't
contradict with Ishwara not being an object of perception. If Ishwara is
beyond formlessness, then we will have to explain how.  Otherwise It
becomes a mere expression of words without any meaning. For example, we can
say ishwara is beyond words, but we cannot say ishwara is beyond Infinite,
which is defined only in a relative sense.
