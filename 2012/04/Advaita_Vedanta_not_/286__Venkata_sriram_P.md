Namaste,

///

the ShAnkara bhAShyam too is significant in the wake of the misconceived idea of non-Advaitic schools

//

Even some of the greatest scholars have a problem with shankara and i dare not say that
they have *misunderstood* advaita. Shri Abhinava Gupta in tantraloka supports jnAna-karma samucchayavAda.

I am reading the book *mOkSa swarUpa nirNayaH* written by Mahamahopadhyaya Mudigonda Nagalinga Sastry Garu who happens to be one of the greatest scholars
Andhra Pradesh has produced. A great vyAkaraNa shAstra paNDita and a shaTkAla
shiva pUja dhurandhara. He was instrumental in propagating shrauta shaiva siddhAnta
in AP and also taught vyAkaraNa shAstra to many stallwarts of advaita in Andhra Pradesh. 

Shri Nagalinga Sastry refutes thevAkya *brahma vit brahmaiva bhavati* in a very silly way
saying that how does one knows brahman who is beyond perception. Even if one becomes brahman, how can he be called as brahman who is nirvikAra, niranjana, nirguNa.
How can he be a niSkriya and yet think that *bahusyAm prajAyEti* and creates the jagat.
He raises these issues and ultimately says that it is Shiva and Shiva Advaita which is 
the ultimate truth. 

Just thinking aloud why the great scholars didn't feel the pulse of Shankara Bhagavatpada.

regs,
sriram
