'Sankara's philosophical conquests are unique in the world. He had his
triumphant tour all over India. He met the leaders of different
schools of thought. He convinced them by arguments and established the
supremacy and truth of the religion that he expounded in his
commentaries. He went to all the celebrated seats of learning. He
challenged the learned men to discussion, argued with them and
converted them to his opinions and views. He defeated Bhatta Bhaskara
and condemned his Bhashya (commentary) on the Vedanta Sutras. He then
met Dandi and Mayura and taught them his philosophy. He then defeated
in argument Harsha, author of Khandana Khanda Kadya, Abhinavagupta,
Murari Misra, Udayanacharya, Dharmagupta, Kumarila and Prabhakara.'

How is it possible Adi Sankara defeated Abhbinavagupta and
Udayanacarya living in 10th Century and Sriharsha in 12th Century?
