For those of a scholarly disposition the attached learned paper on the
technicalities of Vedic chanting by Dr. S. Yegnasubramanian should be very
interesting,. Dr. yegnasubramanianis asometime researcher at Bell
Labs.He isalso one of the very few traditional Vedic scholars who also
has advanced education in the hard sciences, and hence can convey the beauty
and sublimity in English.

This is one of the most authentic examples of traditional Hindu nee Sanatana
Dharma liturgy and worship that you are likely to see in the US. In fact,
this is something which is a rarity even in India, outside the State of
Kerala, Sringeri, Karnataka and Kanchi, Tamilnadu.

It is being conducted under the auspices of the Sringeri Matha, Karnataka,
India.

This was the first of the four principal Shankara Mathas established by Adi
Samkara Bhagavadpada at the 4 corners of India.

The lecture-cum-demonstration on various types of Vedic recitation practice
is something truly unique for scholars and those interested in practices and
culture of Vedic India. 

Please do inform all your friends.
