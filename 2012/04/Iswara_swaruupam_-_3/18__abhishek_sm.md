Pranams,

Evil and good are only relative terms. Just like hot and cold. Fire
can cook food as well as burn forests. Fire is good at some times and
evil at other. For that reason, Sankara describes samsara through the
words- "Mayamayam idam". It is illusionary. Ishwara is also a product
of this Maya and hence is illusionary. Maya is not evil, neither is
Ishwara. Ishwara+Evil,etc woul be incorrect. Para, apara,etc would be
the adhishtanam of Brahman only. Since good, bad,etc are not known as
opposites, neither Brahman nor ishwara can be called evil. This maybe
possible in dvaita where Ishwara can be accredited to the creation of
evil, but certainly not in advaita. Bifurcating Brahman by taking out
Ishwara,etc from Brahman, like as if it were taking out a mug of water
from the sea would be wrong. Even a mug of water though insignificant,
still makes a difference. But this is not true in the case of Brahman.
As said by Bhaskarji, Ishwara+Para+Apara,etc = Brahman but
Brahman=?!!?(Simply undefined). Any description would be incomplete.
