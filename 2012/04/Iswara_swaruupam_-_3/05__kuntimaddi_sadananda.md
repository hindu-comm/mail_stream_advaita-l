PraNAms 

I let other scholars address the questions posed by Shree Rajaram, since I failed miserably in my attempts to answer his persistent questions posed in private mails, to his satisfaction.

One should examine the Virat swaruupa of Bhagavan discussed in 11th Chapter where every thing good and bad are included - One who transcends this aparaa prakRit is pure sat chit ananda swaruupa Brahman.

If you say that Ishwara = Brahman + apara prakrti, it is tantamount to
saying that Ishwara = Brahman + impure prakrti or Ishwara = Brahman + evil.
Sankara clearly says (BG 7.5), that the apara prakrti is "impure" and the
"source of evil" whereas the para prakrti is "pure" and "essentially
myself". There is only one "divine power called Maya" (rf. BG 7.4), which
is seen as Higher when spoken of as Jiva Bhutam and Lower when described as
ahankara etc. As Sankara says in 7.6, "the omniscient Lord is the source of
the Universe through these two prakrtis". If I say, "That boy Rama created
the pot with skill and clay", it does does not mean he is a combination of
 skill and clay! It means that he is different from these though the skill
is his real nature. If the pot is known to be unreal, then we can infer
that it's source clay is also unreal and the act of creation but not Rama.
If the boy called Rama is naturally intelligent but acts stupid in a game,
we don't say that Rama has intelligence and idiocy in equal measure. We say
that his real nature is to be intelligent. In the same sense, para prakrti
is Ishwara's real nature and apara is superimposed on Him due to ignorance.
This is what I understand by reading Sankara. To conclud that there is no
Ishwara in reality, I just need to read God Delusion by Richard Dawkins or
End of Faith by Sam Harris.
