There is nothing else for Isvara/Brahman to see. That does not mean before
creation and after dissolution, Isvara, transcendent to names and
forms, ceases to exist. Sankara specifically uses, with respect to your
king without kingdom, the term Isvaranila (rf. chapter 15) but that is
beside the point. I made a specific objection to Shri Sadananda's use of
Ishwara = Brahman + Apara Prakrti because it is equal to saying Ishwara =
Brahman + Evil. As evil has to be destroyed, Nirishwara Advaitins have to
kill Isvara. I suggested an easy way out - atheism.

When the pot is broken, the space within the pot does not exist anymore,
but the space is not destroyed. The illusion with respect to the great
space that it was within the pot and outside as two distinct entities is
what is destroyed. Isvara is never destroyed. The illusion that He is
distinct from Jiva is.
