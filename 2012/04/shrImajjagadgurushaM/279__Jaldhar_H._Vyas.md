Thankyou for working on this.  Unfortunately I was called away on business 
to a place without proper Internet connectivity so I was unable to get 
this up on the site until now but now you can get the collection of 
stotras in PDF format at:

http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/texts/shankaracharyajayantipathamala.pdf

Or just go to http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/texts/ and you'll find the 
link at the bottom of the page.

The PDF consists of each stotra in Devanagari and on the facing page in 
roman transliteration for those who cannot read Devanagari well.  It is 
meant to be printed on US Letter or A4 sized paper.  If you only want the
transliterations just print the odd pages.  If you only want the 
Devanagari just print the even pages.

We are still missing:

* Shankaracharya padavalamba suvarnamala stuti

* Acharya padavalambana stuti.

If anyone can provide these in ITRANS format I will update the PDF with 
them.
