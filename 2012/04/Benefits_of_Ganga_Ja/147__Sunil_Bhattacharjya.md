While agreeing to the fact the Ganga water is heavily polluted and the Ganga purification project had not been totally successful so far, please permit me to say thet from ancient times Ganga water was collected from Gangadwar (ie. Hardwar) for using in the Vishwanath temple in Varanasi. That shows that it was known in the ancient times also that the Ganga water gets gradually polluted and more so after Ganga meets Yamuna. One should best collect gangajal from Hardwar, or upstream of that.

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Benefits of Ganga Jala

I am surprised that people go GaGa over ganga jal. Do not they read about
the pollution due to industrial wastes and the drainage. Unless it is
collected
high up in the Himalayas it is no more safe.

Hare Krishna

Dont we adore & worship 'bhUmAta' though she is the abode of all sorts of 
things today!!?? gAngA mAta could still maintain her purity & sanctity 
despite all these impurities & contamination. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
