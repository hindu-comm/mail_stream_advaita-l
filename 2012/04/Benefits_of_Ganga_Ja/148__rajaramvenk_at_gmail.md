It is because she is not lady gaga but pavitra ganga :)

You can sprinkle ganga water from anywhere though drink only the tap ganga. I would discourage going upstream. We should work to purify what comes downstream. Getting people to sign the petition is the least we can do.

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Benefits of Ganga Jala

I am surprised that people go GaGa over ganga jal. Do not they read about
the pollution due to industrial wastes and  the drainage. Unless it is
collected
high up in the Himalayas it is no more safe.
