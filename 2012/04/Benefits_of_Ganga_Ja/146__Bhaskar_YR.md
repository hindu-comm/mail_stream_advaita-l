I am surprised that people go GaGa over ganga jal. Do not they read about
the pollution due to industrial wastes and  the drainage. Unless it is
collected
high up in the Himalayas it is no more safe.

Hare Krishna

Dont we adore & worship 'bhUmAta' though she is the abode of all sorts of 
things today!!??  gAngA mAta could still maintain her purity & sanctity 
despite all these impurities & contamination. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
