Namaste

I heard elders saying for Brahmins four Ga s are very important. First
Ga is Gayatri Mantra. We have to do Sandhyavandana without fail 2
times daily in morning and evening. If 3 times possible do it.  Second
Ga is Ganga. But South Indians if they cannot reach Ganga and take
bath in it they can do Japa Gange Gange while bathing and imagine they
are taking bath in Ganga. Third Ga is Gau the sacred cow. We have to
worship and feed cows. Fourth Ga is Gita. We have to study Gita
everyday.
