Namaste

http://gangajal.info/site/benefit.php

Nowadays Ganga water is available in shops for Puja items. Is it pure
Ganga water? Cost is Rs. 30 for one small 200 ml bottle.

I have tasted it. It is very delicious and not like any water in South India.

I want to use it for Abhisheka for idols in Puja. Is it allowed to mix
small quantity of Ganga water and regular water. Some people say we
have to use bore well water only for Puja not other water touched by
people.
