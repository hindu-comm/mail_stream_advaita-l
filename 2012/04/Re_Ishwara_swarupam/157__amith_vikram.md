The real nature of narayana is nirguna brahman and therefore nirupadhika.
Upadhi is a limiting adjunct and form verily limits ishwara. To say " his
maya is non different from him" is one thing, where as to understand how is
another. For one who asserts the ishwara with name and form to be
paramarthika, It doesn't really matter if maya is an upadhi or not.
