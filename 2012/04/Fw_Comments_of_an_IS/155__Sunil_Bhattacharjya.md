Sadanandaji,

Technically you may appear to be right . If I goofed up with word then you may, of course, come to help by putting the right word in place of the word "wanted". If I am permitted to say I will point out that "bahusyaam prajaayeti" appears in Upanishad (Vedanta) and not in Veda and that to me appears to refer to Brahman. Of course none can really know Brahman.

Regards,
Sunil KB

sunilji - when you say Brahman wanted .. you are already at the Iswara stage. There is no wants in Brahman since it creates distinctions. 
Iswara wants are dictated by samaShTi vaasanaas. 
Hari Om!
