The habit of people (especially from Tamil Nadu) to transliterate
Sanskrit letter 'द' as  'dh' is causing problems. Besides the wrong
addition of 'h' which indicates prana to a non-pranyakshara 'द'
there is a tendency to retransliterate it as 'ध'. Thus  Vidhyaranya
is retransliterated as विध्यारण्य.
