The words are: gurupungava pungavaketana

'O The Best among Gurus ! You are none other than Shiva who is
RShabhadhwajaH.'

The first address (sambodhana) is akin to Krishna addressing Arjuna as
'bharataRShabha' (the scion/foremost among the Bharata race)

In an earlier verse ToTaka had said: bhava eva bhavAniti mey nitarAm.. [I
consider You to be none other than Bhava (Shiva)..]

So, here he addresses Shankara as Shiva who is  RShabhadhwajaH.

This is my understanding.
