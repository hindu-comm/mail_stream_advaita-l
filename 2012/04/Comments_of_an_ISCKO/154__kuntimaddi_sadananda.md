sunilji - when you say Brahman wanted .. you are already at the Iswara stage. There is no wants in Brahman since it creates distinctions. 
Iswara wants are dictated by samaShTi vaasanaas. 
Hari Om!

When the Brahman wanted to be many there was modification even. At that stage there was Nirguna and therefore saying that he could have had modificatiuon like gold having shapes as ornaments may not really hold good.
