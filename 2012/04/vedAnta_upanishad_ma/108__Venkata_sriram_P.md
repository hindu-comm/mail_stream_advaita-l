Namaste,

////

how can we concludethat there are ONLY four mahA vAkya-s in the whole cannon of vedAnta?? what are all the special features that determines the mAhAvakya-s & 
distinguishes it from other shruti vAkya-s??

I am sure, you might have studied *types of sentences* in English Grammer during your school days. So, you might be aware of 2 types of clauses ie., a) Main Clause b) Subordinate Clause. The Main Clause is independant of itself that conveys a definite meaning to the sentence whereas Subordinate Clause is dependant on Main Clause to give a complete meaning. 

Similarly, Mahavakya is like Main Clause which stands independant of itself in the upaniSads that are pointers towards the identity of Jiva & Brahman. Whereas, other shruti vAkyas which may seem like mahAvAkyAs are pointers to this mahAvAkyAs only. 
They cannot be termed as mahAvAkyAs. There are only 4 mahAvAkyAs corresponding to
4 vEdAs. 

The upanishad vAkyAs corresponding to the veda where *tat tvam asi* is defined are only
pointers to tat tvam asi only which have to be understood with *bhAga-tyAga lakSaNa*.
Similarly, rest of the 3 mahAvAkyAs. 

BTW, there are dhyAna slokAs, anga / kara nyAsAs for the mahAvAkyAs also but method
of japa prescribed is nidhidhyAsana. These cannot be chanted like rAma nAma etc.

regs,
sriram
