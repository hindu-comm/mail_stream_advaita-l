Respected members,
While on the topic, can someone throw light on other types of vakyas which come in the shruti.
What I know of is that there are two types of pramanas in vedas.
1. Shashanatmak : dealing with what to do and what not to do. and2. Shansanatmak ; dealing with the unity of jeeva, jagat and Ishwara.
Kindly throw some light on this so that any error in understanding can be corrected.

Bhaskarji,

Pranams. The main & secondary clause examples were analogies to show the difference between the 4 mahAvAkyas & other similar shruti vAkyAs. 

Anyway, sukarahasya upanishad details about the anga / kara nyAsas and says that
*mahAvAkyAni chatvAri*

Formal initiation is only given to yatis accordingly as per their amnAya pitha representation.

sriram
