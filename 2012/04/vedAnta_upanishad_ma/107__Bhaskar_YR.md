There are many statements in the Vedanta which directly or indirectly 
provide the identity relation and therefore are many mahaavakyaas. The 
four that are provided are crisp and sample mahavaakyaas, one from each 
Veda -  to show samanvayam or self-consistency in the teaching. 

praNAms Sri Sadananda prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for your kind clarification.  I am happy to note that in 
upanishads,  there can be more than four  mahAvakyA-s.  Who, first, picked 
these four mahAvAkya-s from the upanishads??  Just an inquisitive 
question.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
