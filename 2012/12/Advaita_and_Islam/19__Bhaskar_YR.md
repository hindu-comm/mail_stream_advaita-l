A similar conclusion through yukti will remain invalidated until veda 
pramana is used to validate it. 

praNAms Sri Rajaram prabhuji

Do you prabhuji insisting here, vedA-s which is available (I am afraid to 
say 'written)  today in the language of Sanskrit  & in the text format 
bearing the names like Rig, yajur, sAma, atharvaNa veda??  My question is, 
 if the purports of veda-s available in any other language and bearing a 
different name tag (say some grantha 'X') cannot be considered as pramANa 
for the yukti??  For that matter even veda-s themselves admit that they 
cannot teach brahman as such and such categorically...yato vAcho 
nivartante, na tatra chakshur gacchati, na vAggachati nO manaH, na vidyO 
na vijAneeyO yathaitadanushishyAt, kO addhA veda ka iha pravOchat, kuta 
AjAta kuta iyaM visrushtiH etc. from veda-s would definitely imply that 
even veda-s cannot objectify Ishwara/brahman.  Under these circumstances 
why we should always hold veda-s, available in Sanskrit language as the 
ONLY antya pramANa for the brahma jignAsa ??  an alternative work serving 
the same purpose would not suffice for the sAdhana in jnAna mArga??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
