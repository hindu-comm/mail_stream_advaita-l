If you could read the story you would realize that there is something
called 'adhikAri bheda' in Vedanta.  Shankara talks about shravanamAtreNa
sAkShAtkAraH in the BSB 'lingAccha'.

Also, participating in discussion groups on the internet demands a minimum
access to sites through URLs.  This facility is now very easily available
for anyone to own at home at very low prices.
