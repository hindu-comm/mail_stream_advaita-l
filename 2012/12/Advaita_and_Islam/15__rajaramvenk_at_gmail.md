In a lighter vein, internet access is a precondition for the rise of jnana. 

I had a detailed discussion with my father and am satisfied with his answers - both truthful and clear. I will post sometime.

If you could read the story you would realize that there is something
called 'adhikAri bheda' in Vedanta.  Shankara talks about shravanamAtreNa
sAkShAtkAraH in the BSB 'lingAccha'.

Also, participating in discussion groups on the internet demands a minimum
access to sites through URLs.  This facility is now very easily available
for anyone to own at home at very low prices.
