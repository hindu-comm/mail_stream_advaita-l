I tend to agree with Sri Jaldhar Vyas. Islam (and Christianity) teach adharma. They give codes to live by for the followers, some good mental imagery and a congregation to help each other.  To that extent they are valuable to their societies but their predatory presence is dangerous to non-believers and partially harmful to even believers as the codes are absolute - not set within a framework of dharma. A good muslim boy from a nice family going to a  madarasa risks getting brainwashed in to terrorism, a concept unthinkable in a gurukula. The boy who bombed glasgow airport was a Ph. D. and son of doctor family in B'Lore.

Adi Shankara defeated paths of adharma. I am trying to understand why we don't have such efforts these days. On top of it, instead of at least remaining silent, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Swami Vivekananda etc. seem to give these paths a stamp of approval. I'm trying to understand the position of traditional mutts such as Sringeri on Islam (and Christianity).

It is not a matter of approving of it but the conceptual differences are 
so great.  The various nastika mats may have had different views on karma, 
mukti etc. but atleast they had views.  Now you can certainly criticize 
the effects of Islam (On a case by case basis.) but what debate can you 
have about its concepts? They are indeed adharmic.  Saying anything more 
than that is shouting not debate.

Advaitins are supposed to be out to conquer ignorance and I'm sorry to say 
that this idea that mainstream Christians and Muslims are 
"misunderstanding" their religion at the behest of later, selfish, priests 
has no factual basis whatsover.  Treading the path of those religions 
will not result in jnana because their God insists against jnana and 
demands an exlusive, dualistic relationship.  If there are individual 
Muslims or Christians who wish to transcend that then all well and good 
but they (and especially we) need to understand that they are deviating 
from the mainstream of their faiths.
