praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

One can look at it this way too: The good principles will generate chitta
shuddhi and take that jiva upwards in the sadhana marga.  When he is fit 
to
get the Advaita jnana he will find himself in the circumstances conducive
to that. 

>  Kidnly clarify what are those conducive circumstances, whether the 
sAdhaka (who is pakva) would find these conducive circumstances in the 
vaidika mArga/sAdhana or outside of this vaidika mArga??  is it 
like'saMparka' of some shrOtreeya / brahmaNishTa jnAni?? (like Paul 
Brunton finding the ways with ramaNa maharshi) or something else within 
his own religion and religious leaders?? 

It may not demand a birth in vaidika sampradaya.

>  It may not require a birth in vaidika saMpradAya, but he has to do his 
sAdhana according to vaidika saMpradAya to get that upanishad pratipAdita 
mOksha!! is it not??  if not then we have to admit that there is an 
alternative to vaidika mArga / saMpradAya !!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
