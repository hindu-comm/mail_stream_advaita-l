Namaste,

Shri Madhusudana Saraswati in Siddhanta Bindu says "aupaniSadaM mataM prAmANikaM iti siddhaM".

Which implies that upaniSad mata is the only pramANa here. That which is non-compliant with shruti is dur-mata only. As simple as that.

IMHO, this synthesis of advaita & islam was started with Sant Kabir Das (i presume ??). Not sure whether this trend existed prior to Kabir Das. Some of the songs of Poetess Lalleshwari of Kashmir Saivism does have some synthesis like this. 

Basically, this was comprehended to bring unity among hindus & muslims. 

regs,
sriram
