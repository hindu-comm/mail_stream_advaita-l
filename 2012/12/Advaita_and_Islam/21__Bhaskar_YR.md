You have to discard  the vedic dharma also along with other things in 
order
to become a mukta. Why do people constantly forget this?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Yes, veda too says atra veda aveda..but question here is not about what to 
discard and what to retain in order to become mukta..the question is about 
indispensability of veda-s as an antya pramAna for the sAdhaka-s and 
importance & role  of vaidika mArga for the jnAnOtpatti. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
