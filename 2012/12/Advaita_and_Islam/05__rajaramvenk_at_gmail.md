How can an avaidhika marga give purushartha or be valid? I'm not against the good principles in these religions or the good people.

When a Christian wanted to convert to Hinduism, Sri Chandrashekhara 
Bharati
SwaminaH asked him to get back to his religion and seek proper guidance 
and
thereby ensure his emanicipation in that system itself.  This shows that
the ShankarAchArya did not hold Christianity to be adhArmic or
non-mokShaprada.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I read somewhere that there was a dubious intention behind this request 
from that Christian, hence HH asked him to stay where he is!!  Anyway, 
another way of taking this incident is, HH knew that the prApti/labhya of 
this Christian in this janma is ONLY Christianity hence asked him to stick 
to his own religion even though it (Christianity) is NOT mOkshaprada if 
not adhArmic.  If that is not the case and HH is implying here that 
Christianity is also one of the ways to attain mOksha (if it is 
non-mOkshaprada, it is mOkshaprada only), the 'upa-siddhAnta' that we can 
arrive would be that there are multiple ways for mOksha in all available 
religions on the earth, so it is not an exclusive property of veda dharma 
followers!! that means veda or vedAnta which is having the antya pramANa 
status  to attain mOksha would have the restricted boundaries and called 
as the ONLY patha ( the only way) for those who follow vaidika dharma in 
general and dvija-s in particular. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
