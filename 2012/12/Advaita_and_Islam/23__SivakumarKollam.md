*I'm trying to understand the position of traditional mutts such as
Sringeri on Islam (and Christianity)*

The views of Acharyas are  clear from the discussions of  Sampoojya
Chandrasekhara Bharathi MahaSwamikal, compiled and translated into English
by one of the illustrious disciples of Acharya, Sri Jnananda Bharathi
Swamikal and published by Sringeri
under the title "Dialogues with the Guru."It is an indispensable title for
every Indian, especially Hindus.
