sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes, sAtvikatvam, sajjana-s or satva guNa saMpanna souls are not the sole 
property of hindu dharma, in other religions also we find somany noble 
souls.  But dont you think prabhuji, when it comes to 'philosophy' & its 
repercussions of other religions (like Christianity, Islam etc.) our 
jagadguru-s  should be more 'formal' atleast to the extent of educating 
the 'needy' about the problems of these religions !!?? 

Just thinking loudly without knowing anything negative about the other 
religions.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

PS :  I had made a request off the list sometime back, if your time 
permits, kindly look into it prabhuji.
