A contact with a Jnani can be such a conducive circumstance.  His paripaaka
is such that he accepts that sage, his words as the exact ones required for
his liberation.  Even a book on this topic can bring about such an effect.

Even in laukika jnana like learning any subject such as physics or
mastering a fine art like music one has to apply his mind to the template
of: shravaNa, manana and nididhyasana (practice).  These terms may not
matter but their meaning is clear for every seeker of knowledge. When
Vedanta sampradaya accepts that this knowledge can come to a person through
puraaNa shravaNa also, any other kathA or essay on the topic can work.

When an advanced jiva starts believing in his Self, the belief in the Veda
becomes only secondary; it being stressed only to bring about the former
conviction.  That is why the Vivekachudamani says:  shaastram yuktiH
deshikoktiH pramANam....antaH siddhA svAnubhUtiH pramANam.   Such a
sadhaka, whoever he might be, yaH kashchidapi, will get a feel of things
when the appropriate message is placed by providence in his range.
Everything will fall in place for him.
