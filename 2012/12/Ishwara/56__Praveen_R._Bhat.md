Hari Om, Sureshji,

While quoting what Krishna says in Bhagavadgita, you must also be aware
that the creation itself is Ishvara's leela. If He were to remove all
karmas of all jIvas, that defeats the point of leela. Moreover, Ishvara,
though in the control of Maya, has a role to play as karma phala dAtA; that
is, to give phala as per the karma. He cannot go beyond that role and give
phala irrespective of karma.
