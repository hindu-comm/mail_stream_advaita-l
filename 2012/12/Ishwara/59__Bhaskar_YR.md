In terms of Advaita, what do you mean by "ASK HIM"?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

In terms of advaita & its sAdhana also there should be an unconditional 
'sharaNAgati' to guru & Ishwara...yasya deve parA bhaktiH yathA deve tathA 
gurau, tasyaite kathithA hyarthAH prakAshante mahAtmanaH says one of the 
shruti-s.  So, to get advaita's paramArtha jnAna, first we should learn to 
'ASK' the same at the lotus feet of guru & Ishwara.

However, it is unfortunate that, nowaday, the traditional stand has been 
changed and there is an argument that 'guru' & Ishwara kAruNya is not so 
necessary, a yOgya sAdhaka can realize the jnAna through any mundane means 
without aid/guidance of guru or Ishwara. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
