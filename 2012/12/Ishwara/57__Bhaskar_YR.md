I have a doubt on Ishwara. 

>  good that you have doubts on Ishwara & his duties :-))

It is said that Ishwara is not like jivas subject to prakriti. Krishna 
says so in the Gita, that he is always free and unconditioned. 

>  yes prabhuji, he is mAyi who has complete control over his mAya.

So my question is, why can't Ishwara simply remove the karmas of the 
jivas in bondage? 

>  why should he??  Ishwara does not give katrutva to jeeva-s nor 
karma...na katrutvaM na karmANi lOkasya srujati prabhuH, clarifies lord in 
geeta itself. 

Why go through the elaborate and painful process of sadhana when Ishwara, 
being almighty, can liberate jivas instantly? 

>  again I am not able to understand why should he!!??  Anyway Ishwara's 
kAruNya is there everywhere and he is also willing to help us to get rid 
of this karma bandhana, but first, we should learn to'ASK' him!!  you 
'ask' him it shall be granted to you..

If there were no such thing as Ishwara, then I'd understand why we 
must do all the hard work ourselves - since unconditioned Brahman is not a 
performer of actions. 

>  to 'know' that unconditioned brahman is not a performer of actions...In 
Sri Sada prabhuji's style, we have 'run' to realize that there was no need 
for any running!!

>  I just saw Sri praveen prabhuji's reply to your queries, I shall stop 
here,  you can take his clarification as more authentic and credible.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
