PraNAms
>From my understanding:
1. As per VishisTaadvaita one has do the Veda vihita karmas with an attitude
of kaikaryam for the Lord. Nitya aaraadhana and other things are essential even
after sharaNaagati or baharanyaasam. Sarva dharmaan parityajya .. is
interpreted by Bhagavan Ramanuja as not giving up the puja and other actions
associated with it.
2. From advaita point actions of jnaani become
spontaneous as part of the vibhuti of the Lord or the self. Just as father
plays sports with children–nothing to gain or lose – but the very play become
glory. The beauty of creation is the nature of the Lord as stated in the 10th chapter of Geeta. Flower blooms beautifully. The spring comes with explosive
beauty. Beauty of every butterfly, every leaf glorifies the vibhuuti of the
Lord. So is the jnaani’s actions – He does not have to do it but he does it out
of compassion. 
3. Life involves action; action need not be at
the physical level. Prayers for everyone’s happy are also a contemplative
actions – sarve bhavantu sukhinaH .. or kalE vashatu parjanyaH.. are prayers of
a jnaani since there is nothing he himself wants for his happiness. A jnaani
cannot but teach when a worthy disciple comes to learn. In a way Lord himself
takes uses the BMI of the jnaani to do what is required. Hence we pray –
gurubrahma guruvishnuH..
Hari Om!

______________________________________________________________________________-All actions are limited.They cannot give the "summum Bonum"of life.The Mundaka sruthi states:".Nasti akrtam krtena"Sri Shankara declares that "Action cannot coexist with Jnana just as darkness cannot coexist with light".Sri Shankara explains throught his Bashya on the "Brahmasutra"that just as the knowledge of a 'padartha"or an thing brings the knowledge of that thing,the knowledge of Brahman releases man.For that only "Awareness"is important and not actionThis can be obtained by "Atma vichara"and not action.By their very nature,all actions are limited and binding.A "Jnani"doesnot worry about anything.For him there is nothing which is left to be done.The Bhagawadgita says:Naiva tasya krtenarthah".
