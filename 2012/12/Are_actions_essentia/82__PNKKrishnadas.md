Surely the true way to understand your question is to watch the
arising of action in yourself;  watch the thoughts which motivate you
and lead to action; watch the incessant rajas which makes us move and
act and always want to do something.  Only then will you find out for
yourself the answer to your important questions.  

If someone gives you an answer to your question, your mind will say:
"Now I know the answer", and you will have missed a wonderful
opportunity to find out first-hand from your own self-observation, and
to overcome the manomaya kosha, which keeps you bound to the mind.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Are actions essentially meaningless?

Dear friends, thanks for the responses. 

I'll rephrase my ideas. Let us consider Ramana Maharishi - he didn't
have to act like a normal person, he could be in the samadhi state
without any need for action. We are not on that level, which means we
still have some karma to work out. Maybe, that's why we are restless. 

So my question is, is prescribed action simply a way to do away with
this restlessness (caused by our vasanas)? Is it simply a means to an
end? That's why I gave the prison example - doing something until we
are free of all residual karma.
