Even in dualistic traditions such as gaudiya vaishnavam, action is not
required to please god to earn his grace. Only bhakti is required and it is
not a result of action. It is nitya siddha svarupa shakti of Jiva. this
svarupa shakti in the Jiva is non- if fervent from the internal potency or
heading shakti of Bhagavan. They perform action only to have this Bhakti
shakti manifest in the mind ( Manogati ).

Even an advaitin has to perform Bhagavad Bhakti - not mechanically but with
genuine enthusiasm from within the heart - if he should experience bliss.
Otherwise, his mind will suffer the effects of prarabda karma. Of course,
he can take recourse to karma, yoga etc. but that will be of interest only
if he has not attained bhagavad bhakti ruci.
