Namaste

Jnani will treat the actions like a dream. Good actions and bad
actions are dreams only. If he is doing bad actions it will not
disturb him. If you kill some person in your dream will you get
disturbed when awake? If he is doing bad actions they are coming from
Prarabdha. He is not doing any bad action with his own will. Because
he has killed his ego. He will not feel I am doing this action. All
his actions are happening without his ego and will power. They are
happening from Prarabdha. This Prarabdha is like a force. It will make
him do actions but he will not feel I am doing the actions.

Some Jnani may smoke. But this is coming from Prarabdha. He did not
start smoking after he became Jnani. He will see smoking like a dream
action. He may get cancer because of smoking. Even cancer disease also
he will see like a dream because disease is for body only not Atma.
But we are not like Jnani. We cannot see actions like dreams. We have
to avoid bad actions.
