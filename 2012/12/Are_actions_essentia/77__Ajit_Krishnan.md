>From a practical point of view --

If "we are already Brahman", we are brahman before death, and after death.
If, in this instant, your heart would not cry out inspite of being
destitute, handicapped and reviled by society, you are already that. If, in
this instant, your ego would not rise inspite of accomplishing your most
cherished life goal (including renunciation and mukti), you are already
that.

Until then, we should be honest with ourselves -- "we" are nowhere close to
"that". And sadhana and the pursuit of dharma is all that matters. Anytime
we let our ego run free, and anytime we engage in selfish action, we are
"killing time".

sasneham,

    ajit
