RV: Every action is preceded by a desire and decision, implicit or
explicit. The desire comes out of past karma vasana due to a memory of what
is desirable and not. But the decision is made based on what sastras (or
conscience) say even when we over-ride the injunction impelled by the power
of desire. I, the person who decides, can have an intellectual
understanding that it is only the prakrti that acts. But this sankalpa - I
shall do this and I shall not do this - is inevitable. How can I possibly
think that I am not the doer when I decide to do or not? Even a jivan mukta
does not feel the pain and plesures (prarabda) of some other body and even
he has to decide between different courses of action possible in any
situation.
