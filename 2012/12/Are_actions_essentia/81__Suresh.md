Dear friends, thanks for the responses. 

I'll rephrase my ideas. Let us consider Ramana Maharishi - he didn't have to act like a normal person, he could be in the samadhi state without any need for action. We are not on that level, which means we still have some karma to work out. Maybe, that's why we are restless. 

So my question is, is prescribed action simply a way to do away with this restlessness (caused by our vasanas)? Is it simply a means to an end? That's why I gave the prison example - doing something until we are free of all residual karma.

Suresh
