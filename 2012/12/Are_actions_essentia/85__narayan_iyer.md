For the student advaitin, yes, doing prescribed action is a way to discipline the mind. For the realized person, it is usually only a pedagogical tool, to set an example for disciples in how to discipline oneself. If one is at the point where one is still and undisturbed by anything, including a need to teach others, action will indeed be meaningless. To that extent, think of actions as not being "essentially" meaningless, but as "ultimately" meaningless. 

For the non-advaitin, actions remain meaningful always, in one form or the other, whatever verbal construction they may put on the relationship between karma and jnana.
