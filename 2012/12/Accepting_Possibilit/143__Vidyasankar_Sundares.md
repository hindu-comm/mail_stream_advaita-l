These sorts of questions should not really arise. Along with pramANa-s, there is
an accepted mode of the realms in which the pramANa-s operate. One need not
look to the SAstras for things that are amenable to ordinary pratyaksha-anumAna
and one should not attempt to bracket the SAstra-s within the bounds of reason
either. Any contradiction that seemingly arises can be easily explained and in fact,
have already been explained, as and when appropriate.
