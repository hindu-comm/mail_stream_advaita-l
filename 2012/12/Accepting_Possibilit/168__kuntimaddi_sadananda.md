PraNAms

Subbhuji is absolutely correct. Dis-covering the laws of Nature are only dis-covering the vibhuti of the Iswara - All within the realm of vyaavahaarika satyam. 
Vedanta is also a science science of absolute reality and Yoga shaastra provides a means to appreciate that science. 
Conflicts arises only when one mixes the reference states within which each science is valid. 
Hari Om!
