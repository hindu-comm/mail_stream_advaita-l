While we would like to see what exactly is said there by Madhusudana
Saraswati, it is the siddhAnta of Advaita Vedanta that the entire portion
pertaining to duality in the Veda - the description of creation, karma,
jiva-s, lokaantara, upAsana, etc. is only an 'anuvAda', a restatement of
what is naturally available to people due to avidyA based on the nAnAtva of
jiva-s and finitude, paricchinna bhrAnti, of jiva-s.  The famous
'dvA-suparNA' mantra of the Mundakopanishad is one such anuvAda of the
avidyAprApta dvaita by the Upanishad.  In fact according to Shankara, in
the adhyAsa bhAshya, even the Upanishadic literature dealing with mokSha
sAdhana is only a statement based on the avidyA-born notion that one is
bound.  The Upanishad comes to remove this notion by teaching the means of
release and thereby enabling the jiva to realize that there was no bondage
in the first instance.
