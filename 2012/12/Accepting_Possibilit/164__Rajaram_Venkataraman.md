I am not suggesting that we blindly reject shastras as untrue. When
shastras contradict pratyaksha and anumana, we have to examine and accept
whatever is true.  This is not my position but what I think is the correct
traditional position. Please read my original post with quotes from
Gaudapada, Sankara and Madhusudana. Sri Subrahmanian also independently
posted on the concept of anuvada, the exact term used by Madhusudana.

In fact, I was thinking that shastras should be the authority on unseen
matters such as posthumous result of karma, jivEshwara bhEdA in vyavahara
realm etc. But according to Madhusudana even that can be a mere reflection
of human delusion.
