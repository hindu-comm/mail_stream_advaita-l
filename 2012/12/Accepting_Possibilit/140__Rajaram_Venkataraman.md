RV: Pratyaksha and Anumana are also valid pramanas. If they contradict
shruti, then do we reject them and accept Shruti? If you refer to my quotes
from Gaudapada, Sankara and Madhusudana, it does not seem to be the case.
But I would like to know the opinion of the traditional scholars as they
know best how our acharyas react to reason that contradicts shastras.
