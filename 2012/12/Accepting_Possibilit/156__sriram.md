Dear
It is fully true that the earth not only moves around the sun but also turns 
around its axis thus creating day and night whose duration variations are 
because of the tilt in the axis of rotation coupled with the position of the 
earth in the orbit in which it journeys around the sun.I dont think our 
scriptures have ever denied this aspect.They have been saying day and night 
are created by sun who is also responsible for the seasons.Perhaps what you 
are not able to reconcile is certain portions of the shruthi which talks 
about astronomical phenomena like grahanam,appearance of comets,planets 
movements across the sky and diseases which afflict humans from time to time 
etc does not give logical reasons  for such phenomena  and its suggested 
remedies donot work always.The stock reply is -from your point of view -one 
should have faith.Attempts have been made by scholars to explain the logic 
behind all these and it is going on.My point is it is all personal 
problems.You have to reconcile science and shastra by proper enquiry and 
deep study.If you feel that science is correct in certain matters accept it 
and passon.There is no point in telling shastras are found wanting.Or if you 
are a die hard vedantist stick to its prescription and move on.Like some 
Christian groups-Penta costsI think they never go to a doctor for any 
illness.-.It is your life and you have to take care of  it according to your 
intellectual capacity.Nobody can answer all the questions to your 
satisfaction is my view.You have to find the answers using science or 
vedantha.Both are correct in their own spheres.Truth is a truth is 
truth.R.Krishnamoorthy.
