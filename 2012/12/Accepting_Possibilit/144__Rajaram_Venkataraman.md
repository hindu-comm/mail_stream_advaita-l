RV: When shastras talk about yajnas, it is beyond the realm of pratyaksha
and anumana. But when shastras talk about the structure of the solar system
or the growth of a fetus in the womb, they co-exist with pratyaksha and
anumana (science) in providing knowledge. In such cases, what is the
traditional position on accepting shastras versus science?
