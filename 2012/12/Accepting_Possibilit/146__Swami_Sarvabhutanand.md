*OM
The prerequisite for Sruti vicArA is SHRADDA in shAstram, shraddA in
SampradAyA,shraddA in GURU.
Logical analysis does not hold good in BRAHMA jnAnam.
Logical analysis cannot accept the pursuit!
I appreciate your effort in analysing shAstrA.
It is the paramparA and sampradAyam to help the student understand!
wishes and love.
Sw.SrvabhutAnandA
