Namaste,

alpashca kAlo bahavashca vighnAH /
Yat-sAra-bhUtam tad-upAsitavyaM
Hamso yathA kshhIram-ivAmbhu-rAshau //

Scriptures are infinite and much has to be known. Time is short and there
are too many obstacles. So what constitutes the essence has to be
propitiated. Just as a hamsa bird separates  milk from  water.

Best Wishes,

Vinayaka
