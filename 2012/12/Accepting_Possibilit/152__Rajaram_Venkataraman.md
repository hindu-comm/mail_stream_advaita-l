RV:

1. I would like to know if you consider the creationist model in purusha
suktam as conflicting with scientific view of how universe and life came
about. Let us say, hypothetically, that a shruti vakya is contradicted by
scientific discoveries, what should be taken as true?
2. When Madhusudana talks about shastras reflecting the delusion of people,
he is not isolating smrti shastras but also including shruti as he is
talking about jivEshwara bheda. I do not know if you are justified in
insulating shruti vakyas potential defects.
