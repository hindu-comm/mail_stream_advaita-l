Yes, tureeya is not a peculiar state, we have to realize that we are 
always tureeya, shankara says sushupti avasthA viveka ( the knowledge of 
sushuptAvasthA) would tell us about the tureeya, who is Ota-prOta in all 
the three states.  And for the tureeya Atman shruti says all the three 
other avasthA-s are mere dream..(trayee svapnAH).

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
