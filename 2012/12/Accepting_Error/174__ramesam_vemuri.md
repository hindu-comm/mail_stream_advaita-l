"Scientist discovering the helplessness in the process of research has the
right attitude and the MIND to appreciate and understand VEDANTA!"
SWAMI SARVABHUTANANDA


* Helplessness * leads to dejection, confusion, to depresssion -----> inability to take decision/action 
(e.g. BG - I; Verses 36-41 Vivekachudamani).


For Self-inquiry / scientific research one needs a healthy, balanced mind, robust enthusiasm, child-like curiosity and a sense of wonder.

regards,
