Namaste,

Both, "Optimists and Pessimists" are essential for the progress. Fundamentally, scientists are trained to look at and evaluate the possible potential problems in advance.

"Optimists" invented the "Plane", 


where as,

"Pessimists" invented the "Parachute "


Best wishes for 2013

Dr Yadu
