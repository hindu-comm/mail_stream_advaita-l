In short, your doubt is whether bhagavAn ramaNa maharshi's teachings (who 
am I?? ) conform with the traditional teachings of Amnaya advaita 
saMpradAya??  If you see the traditional approach to jnAna mArga it is 
someway different from bhagavAn's teaching.  adhikAra bedha, anubandha 
chatushtaya, sAdhana chatushtaya, shravaNAdi sAdhana-s  etc. holds the 
key.   I dont think these requirements would be insisted in ramaNa's way 
of teaching.  Having said this, I am not saying ramaNa's teaching is 
ineffective, it has its own flavor in its own realm. 

BTW, Sri lakshmaNa sharma (pen name 'who') observes in his book mAhA yOga 
that living sage's words (upadesha) is more sacred and efficacious than 
the scriptures/shAstra !!??  As you know this will not go well within the 
orthodox circle as they hold shAstra is the ultimate pramANa for brahma 
jignAsa or mOksha sAdhana.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
