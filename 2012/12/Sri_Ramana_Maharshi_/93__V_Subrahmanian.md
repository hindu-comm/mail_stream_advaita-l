In the book 'Exalting Elucidations' of Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha
SwaminaH of Sringeri, in the chapter 'Jnani' on page 311 we find this:

Quote:

Disciple: What is the reason for two jivanmuktas giving differing advices
to their disciples?

Acharyal: Jivanmuktas are those who have realized the Truth and are devoid
of vasanas (tendencies of the mind). They may have practiced different
spiritual disciplines and so may advise others differently.  Instructions
are given keeping in mind the competence of the disciple.  This is another
reason for the differences in their advices.
