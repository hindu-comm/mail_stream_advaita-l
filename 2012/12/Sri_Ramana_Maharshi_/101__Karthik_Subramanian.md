While at this, can members please shed light on whether the Maharshi actually approved of all this puja and deifying. I can understand a puja needs to be performed for the Mahalingam, but what about making it out as a pucca ritual and etc. Isn't this steering away from the self-enquiry path?

Regards,
Karthik

Dear Kartik,

///
I am not looking forward to comments such as quoting the appearance of Sringeri Mutt's name in an ashtottara version 

On the other hand, I have had the good opportunity of meeting the descendants of Sri Ramana Maharshi and got the information that the only accepted Ashtottara version is the one in vogue, being followed by the ashram, composed by Sri Viswanatha Swami. 

//

The Ramana Ashram itself had published a book through it's ashram by the name "Ramana Puja Kalpa". In that book, one of the ashtottara namavali has been published which was composed by none other than Sri Jagadeesha Sastrigal. 

The 8th name is "srI sringAdri muttAdhIsha bhAvitAya namO namaH". 

Upon asking Bhagan by a devotee,Bhagavan replied it points towards Sri Satchidananda Sivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati Mahaswamigal of Sringeri. 

Also, Sri Jagadeesa Sastrigal composed Ramana Sahasranamavali which is adopted by devotees for parayana. 

Hope it is clear. 

regs,
sriram
