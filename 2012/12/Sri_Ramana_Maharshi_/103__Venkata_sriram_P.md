Namaste,

//
While at this, can members please shed light on whether the Maharshi actually approved of all this puja and deifying

//

While editing Ramana Gita, Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni asked about which form ofBhagavan to be contemplated upon. Bhagavan approved this which was 
later incorporated in Ramana Gita.

The rough translation goes as:

"In showering grace, He is like the Moon, the friend of the Blue Water Lilly. 
In the same way, in Lusture, He is like the Sun, the Kinsman of the Lotus. In
His Brahmic State, He reminds us of His Father Lord Dakshinamurthy, abiding
under the Banyan Tree. Him, the Moveless One, we lovingly remember".
BTW, at the time of consecration of Matrubhuteshwara Temple, the Srichakra which was brought for pratiSTa, was made to touch by Bhagavan for few minutes and later on formal kumbhAbhiSeka was performed.
