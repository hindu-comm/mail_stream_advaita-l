In any case, I remember that one lady had
mentioned to Bhagavan that she had absolutely no time left to practice
self-inquiry after having attended to her husband and children, and asked
if she could instead do Ramana nAma japA and Bhagavan said okay. That's
just one example I remember and there may be more.

I was not in an argumentative mood when I was asking for the relevant 
quotes, I was sincerely looking for the appropriate 
quotes/incidences...anyway, thanks for your time.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
