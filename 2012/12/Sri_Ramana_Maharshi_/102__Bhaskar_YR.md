I can understand a puja needs to be performed for the Mahalingam, 

>  May I know what is the purpose behind doing this  mahAlingArchana?? 

but what about making it out as a pucca ritual and etc. Isn't this 
steering away from the self-enquiry path?

>  for that matter to take self-inquiry path ( i.e. sanyAsa) in a 
traditional way, the aspirant has to perform/undergo several rituals, like 
shirOmundana, yagnOpaveeta visarjana, virajAhOma etc.  BTW I am not able 
to understand the word 'pucca' here, what is this?? pls. elaborate.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
