In deep sleep,the Mandukya upaishath clearly states that the jiva is 
merged with Ishwara,but it is a state of "ajnana".

>  The hetu for this not knowing (jnAnAbhAva) in sushupta is 'ekatva' 
clearly clarifies shankara.

The karika states that
 the jiva is 'bijanidra yutah".This state is with the state of 
"sleep"that is "ignorance".

>  here beeja nidra is not avidyAbeeja..Sri SSS clarifies this doubt in 
paramArtha chitAmaNi and 'rahasya vivrutti'.

That is why the "jiva"cannot see or aware of 
"Brahman".

>  he cannot see or aware of brahman or his svarUpa because of 'ekatva' 
again clarifies shankara in chAndOgya by giving the 'honey' example. 

The Mandukya clearly states that the fourth state,the 
'caturtha avastha"is "all awareess"ad states that"Sa Atma, sa 
Vijneyah".The karika also further explains this.

>  again tureeyAvasthA is not a separate state, it is the samyak darshana 
or samyaK bhAva of the realized ones. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
