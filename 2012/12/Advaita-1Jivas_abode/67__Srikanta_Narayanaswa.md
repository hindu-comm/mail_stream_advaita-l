In deep sleep,the Mandukya upaishath clearly states that the jiva is 
merged with Ishwara,but it is a state of "ajnana".The karika states that
 the jiva is 'bijanidra yutah".This state is with the state of 
"sleep"that is "ignorance".That is why the "jiva"cannot see or aware of 
"Brahman".The Mandukya clearly states that the fourth state,the 
'caturtha avastha"is "all awareess"ad states that"Sa Atma, sa 
Vijneyah".The karika also further explains this.
N.Srikanta.
