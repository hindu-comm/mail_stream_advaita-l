Namaste,

I am starting a fresh thread as I do not want to
add anything to the topic of apaurusheyatva of veda-s.
(a topic that has been discussed many many times)

Here are some thoughts on veda and breath association:
- paramAtmA is yogeshvara
- paramAtmA performs His yanjna-s via breath control alone
- in this sense, yajna vidyA (veda-s)is His very breath
- rAma rakshA stotra says "ghrANam pAtu makha trAtA"

hari Om

Regards,
Shrinivas
