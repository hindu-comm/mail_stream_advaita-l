In fact there can hardly be a more unambiguous statement and detailed
explanation by Shankara than the one cited in the Mandukya kaarikaa bhashya
on the state of the merger during sushupti.  He gives the extra detail in
the meaning of the 'prANa bandhanam hi somya manaH' of the Chandogya, goes
on to explicitly say that only in true realization we have to understand
the Sat as 'freed' from kAraNatva (saguNatva).  So, Shankara is very
explicit, most unambiguous here.  In fact this is the best reference for
everyone in the matter of deciding the state of the jiva in suShupti.
