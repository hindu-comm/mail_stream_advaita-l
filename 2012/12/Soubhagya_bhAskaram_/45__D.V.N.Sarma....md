Lalita - Sahasranama With Bhaskararaya's Commentary

(Hardcover - 1999)

*by K Kunjunni Raja*

*Publisher *: The Adyar Library And Research Centre

This book is out of print I think. You can write to them and try. Here is
another from the same publisher. I remember the translation is based on
Soubhagya Bhaskaram.
