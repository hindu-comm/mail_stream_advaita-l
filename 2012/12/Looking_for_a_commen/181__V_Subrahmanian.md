Namaste

There is a Sanskrit commentary on the Jivanmukti viveka of Sri Vidyaranya
by a great scholar Sri Achyuta Rai MoDak. [ He has also penned a commentary
on the Panchadashi (which I have)]. I would like to procure this book
either by purchasing or downloading.  Any help in this is greatly
appreciated.
