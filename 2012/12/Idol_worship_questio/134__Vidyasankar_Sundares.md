If that anyone has the capacity to see brahman in any stone, then absolutely no problem.
Although, someone with such an advanced level of sama-darSana may not see any need
to do any special pUjA to even a properly consecrated vigraha in a temple.

Why confuse the supposedly historical with what is at the level of individual sAdhana?

In the time when there was only vaidika yajna, electric power was not available and nobody
could get light at the flip of a switch. Are we prepared to live without the convenience of 
electricity today? If you can accept change in secular matters, what is the big deal about
religious matters that are an intrinsic part of the tradition you have inherited? True, advaitins
do not particularly agree with vaishNava conceptions of the vigraha in a temple being an arca-
avatAra, but no AcArya in the advaita tradition has argued that you should not go to a temple.
