Then what is the purpose of doing Pooja to Idols? Anyone can pick up a
stone and worship it.

Some people say the Idol worship in temples came afterwards. Before
there was only Vedic Yajna. They offered things to Agni and Agni
conveyed the same to Gods. But Idol worship is not necessary. If Idol
worship was not started the Muslims could not have attacked our
temples and looted us.
