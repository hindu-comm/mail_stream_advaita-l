Namaste,

Lord Krishna said "Pratima alpabuddhinam, sarvatra samadarshinam"


Pratima worship is for the beginners. The advanced sadhakas see god everywhere. There is a story about one saint in Maharashtra. Once the saint was preparing his chapati / roti and one dog suddenly came near him and took away his chapati. The he ran after the dog like a mad man and he also carried a pot of ghee / toop with him. He was shouting and telling the dog "O' Lord please don't take the dry chapati. Let me apply some ghee in it".

Regards,
Sunil KB

Then what is the purpose of doing Pooja to Idols? Anyone can pick up a
stone and worship it.

Some people say the Idol worship in temples came afterwards. Before
there was only Vedic Yajna. They offered things to Agni and Agni
conveyed the same to Gods. But Idol worship is not necessary. If Idol
worship was not started the Muslims could not have attacked our
temples and looted us.
