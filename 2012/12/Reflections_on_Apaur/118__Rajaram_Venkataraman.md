Dear Friends, please find the link to my blog on the topic and share your
comments. I dont think there is a way to conclusively resolve this. But it
is worth looking at the challenges and the solutions. Of course, it is at a
high level and does not deal with the importanct of Veda Apaureshyatva from
Advaita point of view.
