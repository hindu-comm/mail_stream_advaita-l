Dear Anandji,

There could be two reasons for not doing Tirtha-yatra during the Chaturmashya. 


One reasons could be that the Chaturmasya period is the period of Vishnu-shayana, ie. the period between the Shayana-ekadashi and the Utthana-ekadashi. Lord Krishna went for the final round of talks with the Kauravas on the day after the Utthana-ekadashi.

The second reason could be a practical one as the people would face a lot of inconvenience due to rain. It is for this reason that the parivrajakas stayed in one place during the Chaturmasyas. Now-a-days Chaturpakshas are observed and not the Chaturmasas and that may probably be due to precessional changes that have occurred.


Regards,

Dear Shri Sriramji,

Please see the section "atha malamAse varjyAni" in the first
pariccheda. The very first sentence contains the word "tIrthAdiyAtrA"
under the list of prohibitions. Later he
clarifies it as "apUrvatIrthadevadarshanam", visiting a tIrtha not
visited before.

Please let me know the reference which recommends against tIrtha yAtrA
during the chAturmAsya period.

Anand
