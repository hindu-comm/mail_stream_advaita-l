To answer the larger question, one should follow the dharma of ones 
sampradaya and locality.  Consider a similar issue.  South Indian 
Brahmanas are vegetarians but in the North there are some jatis that eat 
meat.  Should a person from Bangalore who moves to Kathmandu take up meat 
eating?  No.  Same for calendars.

This was my understanding too.

The nirNayasindhu (of which dharmasindhu is an abridgement) has a section 
in 2nd parichheda shrAvaNamAsa karmANi on nadInAM rajodoshaH where it 
quotes a shloka from Hemadri quoting Atri Smrti:

siMhakarkaTayormadhye sarvA nadyau rajasvalAH |
na snAnAdIni karmANi tAsu kurvIta mAnavaH ||

"During the simHa and karkaTa solar months, all rivers are 
menstruating[1].  Men should not do karmas such as bathing etc. there."

[1] Rivers have feminine gender in Sanskrit.

Not all tirthas are on river banks but many are so this could explain why 
tirthayatra is not allowed during Chaturmasa (or atleast those months of 
it.)
