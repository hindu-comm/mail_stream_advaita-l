As many of you may know, this year there is an extra ("adhika") bhAdrapada
month. An interesting question has arisen, studying the list of mala mAsa
varjyas (prohibtions) listed in the dharma sindhu. One of the prohibitions
is visiting a tIrtha hitherto not visited. One may visit a tIrtha that
he/she had already visited before, but there is a prohibition against
visiting a new pilgrimage spot. Now, as per the South Indian amAnta
Panchanga, the adhika bhAdrapada mAsa begins on August 18. However,
following the North Indian PUrNimAnta system, the adhika bhAdrapada mAsa
begins on August 3. Suppose a person living in Bangalore ( or somewhere
else where the amAnta system is followed) wants to undertake a tIrtha
yAtra, he may do so before August 18. Suppose further that he intends to
visit Kashi Vishwanath on August 16. This is permitted as per his locale in
South India, but the temple he intends to visit follows the North Indian
pUrNimAnta panchanga, and as per that panchanga the adhika bhAdrapada mAsa
is already in effect on August 16! Is the visit to the shrine on August 16
permitted or not, as per the dharma shAstras?
