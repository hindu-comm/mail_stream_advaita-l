Namaste Dear Anand Ji,

I have a copy of dharma sindhu and referred to the vidhi & nishedhAs of tirtha yAtra.
But could not find the clause that one should not do tirtha yAtra during adhika mAsa.
If you don't mind, could you please share the sloka, adhyAya details etc. I will try to
find out again. 

As per the skAnda purANa (avanti khaNDa), adhika mAsa is supposed to be
very auspicious month for dharma kAryAs & tirtha yAtra. However, since the
forthcoming adhika mAsa falls during the chAturmAsya vrata, IMHO, tirtha yAtra
to any place is not advisable during this chAturmAsya period. Corrections are
welcome.

regs,
sriram
