Namaste,
Chaturmasya vrata can be undertaken not only by Yatis but also
Gruhastas. The norms for Gruhasta is that during the 4 month period
they should refrain from taking certain kinds of food during each
month of the 4 months. If the Grahastas have taken Sankalpa for the
Chaturmasyas only travel is not advised. Visiting one's Guru during
Chaturmasya and taking Vedanta Pathas from Him has usually been the
norm.

Thanks and Regards,
Sriram
