Dear Shri Sriramji,

>I have a copy of dharma sindhu and referred to the vidhi & nishedhAs of tirtha yAtra.
>But could not find the clause that one should not do tirtha yAtra during adhika mAsa.
>If you don't mind, could you please share the sloka, adhyAya details etc.  I will try to

Please see the section "atha malamAse varjyAni" in the first
pariccheda. The very first sentence contains the word "tIrthAdiyAtrA"
under the list of prohibitions. Later he
clarifies it as "apUrvatIrthadevadarshanam", visiting a tIrtha not
visited before.

>As per the skAnda purANa (avanti khaNDa), adhika mAsa is supposed to be

Please let me know the reference which recommends against tIrtha yAtrA
during the chAturmAsya period.

Anand
