Namaste,

///

This is perhaps due to the overall inspiration and spiritual guidance of Swami Chidananda (Sri Subramanya Iyer in his Purvasrama).

//

A small correction in the above statement.

Shri N.Subramanya Iyer is not a sanyasi. He was a grihasthA only and *chidAnandanAtha*was his srividyA dIkSa nAma. It is not Swami Chidananda.

Pls note the correction. He was lovingly addressed as *sir* by his disciples. He was devi kAmAkSi in human form ! Shri Goda Venkateshwara Sastrigal belongs to this parampara only.

regs,
sriram
