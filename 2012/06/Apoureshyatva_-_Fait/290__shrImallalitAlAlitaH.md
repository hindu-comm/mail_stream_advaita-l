This will need study of purANa-s.
Although, I think that the texts about sR^iShTi do not go in this much
detail.
They just say brahmA came and gave it to manu, etc.
Moreover, R^iShi-s are accepted in deva-loka, etc. also.

If this happened then those people got birth for bhoga only. Although
practice of satya, etc. is also dharma, is to be remembered.

Talk of unfairness doesn't apply to facts. If the above said happened, then
it was result of their karma, is to be accepted. There is nothing without
cause.

'Along with' means to say that in the same time. But, was this time a
second, is the wuestion.

Because they are common to both or distinct from both. They have some
qualities which are uncommon to manuShya and devatA-s.

Again the same question arises about the time called sR^iShTi. Is it a
specific second or vast flow of time ?
In first case, there could be no solution other than illusion for such
thing(sR^iShTi-kriyA) to take place.
In second case, which is accepted by mImAMsaka-s as well as scientists,
words quoted above don't fit.
mImAMsaka-s generally don't accept sR^iShTi and pralaya. They take this
world as pravAha-nitya.

apauruSheyatva and prAmANya, both are different things - is to be
understood first.
If apauruSheyatva is not established and prAmANya is established anyhow,
then there is not problem for vaidika-s.
But, if prAmANya can not be established, either by establishing
apauruSheyatva or pauruSheyatva, then everything said by veda-s loses it's
validity. If words are not pramANa, then they must be generators of bhrama
or saMshaya. So, this option is not acceptable.

Your question and answers are not in harmony.
You question is related to people who feel that evolution theory is opposed
to prAmANya, etc. of veda-s and you answer talks about people unaware of
this problem.
