RV:  Sri Vidyasankar's argument is well presented. However, the problem of
accepting modern scientific position on evolution is truthfully highlighted
by Sringeri Acharya (rf. Sri Subrahmanian's post).

The notion of evolution (albeit with room for god) is there in vaiseshika
world view but it was not acceptable to other Vedic traditions. Please note
that the theory of evolution does not accept intelligent design, where god
guides evolution, because the evolutionary process seems to be highly error
prone and random.

Even if I did nothing about it, the scientific and traditional view stand
opposed to each other.

RV: Origin of the Universe or life forms is atindriya only. It may not be
beyond the manas as we can think about it but they are not matters for
pratyaksha to deal with. Vedas talk about how universe is created, life is
formed etc. in  great detail.  When it contradicts observed facts, we
cannot selectively reject those portions. By the same logic, if
neuroscience  or physics explains the nature of self or consciousness we
should reject Vedic view of the same. Sringeri acharya rejects evolution
not because the genetic or fossil evidence is not convincing but because it
is not in alignment with the principles of Veda dharma.
