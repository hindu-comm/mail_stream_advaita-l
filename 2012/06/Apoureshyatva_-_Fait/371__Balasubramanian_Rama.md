I am on travel and don't have the books with me. It's however
irrelevant whether it's under this sUtra or anywhere else. For the
simple reason - shankara could have said "Your model of creation
violates so and so sentences in shruti about creation". Instead he
says "Make pradhAna subservient to brahman and I have no problem with
your theory of creation by pradhAna". This clearly shows that these
theories of creation are orthogonal to what Shankara thinks is
important and as long as they don't violate the essential things it's
irrelevant to him where the theory of creation sprung from - shruti
texts themselves or from sAnkhyA texts.
