I think you are referring to a different sutra's bhashya above.  What I
have spoken about is regarding the sutra   तर्काप्रतिष्ठानादपि....2.1.11
where the entire bhashya is about the topic of tarka.  That it is chiefly
to address the pradhAnavAdin, sAnkhya is not in doubt:

नच प्रधानवादी तर्कविदामुत्तम इति सर्वैस्तार्किकैः परिगृहीतो येन तदीयं मतं
सम्यग्ज्ञानमिति प्रतिपद्येमहि |

Could you pl. show me the exact bhashya sentences, *from the BSB
2.1.11*that represent what you say above?
