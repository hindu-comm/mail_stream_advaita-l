RV: Religion has also caused a lot of damage to lives. In the pursuit of
truth, I see no difference between a scientist and a philosopher. Both deal
with matters such as self, consciousness, origin etc. If what Sri Sadananda

fundamental difference even in the methodology adopted by rishis and
scientists though conclusions are different.
