I had a detailed talk about the theory of evolution viz-a-viz the Vedic
tradition with the widely admitted authority in pUrvamImAmsA shAstra, Dr
Mani Dravid SastrigaL.  In just one remark, a true mark of an eminent
scholar of his genre, he dismissed the possibility of accommodating the
above theory into the Vaidika method of thinking:  He said, in Tamil: 'avA
tarkattai vecchunDuthAne chollara, adu eppaDi oru tIrmAnamAgum?' [They say
only based on tarka, logic.  How can it be a conclusive proof?] And went on
to allude to the Sutra bhashya on tarkApratiShThAnAt where it is
established that 'a conclusion based on tarka today can be unsettled by a
more efficient tarka of tomorrow.  It is impossible to bring together at
one platform, at one point of time, the logicians of all the times of past
present and future and determine things.'

And he approved the arguments the Sringeri Acharya had given on the topic
as the correct view to hold on this.
