Unfortunately this quote refers to the true nature of reality or
brahman which cannot be settled by tarka and is quite different from
the way it is being used here (in the realm of "creation" or rather
transformation of one thing into another). Ramesh has already referred
to the passages on creation and the interpretation by Sankara in the
sUtra bhAShya. There seems to be a concerted effort in misinterpreting
what Ramesh is saying - all he is saying is that the vedantic view is
*not contradicted* by theories of evolution. Whys is this so difficult
to understand?
