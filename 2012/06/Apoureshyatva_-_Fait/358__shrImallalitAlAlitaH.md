This is correctly said.
We must remember that we are talking in terms of If and then here. It shows
that we are talking about possibilites only and not truth.
That's why I told somewhere that anumAna is different from saMbhAvanA.
Moreover, test of validity is applicable of both apauruSheyatva of veda-s
and theories of science. Granting any one validity without tests is just a
fancy show of faith and lack of wit.
