Let me gently remind you, a veritable master of the Acharya's Bhashya
vAkyams, that it is a case of laukika and vaidika karma.  In the
janmAdyasya yataH (second sutra bashyam and not the fourth as I had
doubtfully mentioned erlier) 

>  If memory serves me right, shankara, similarly, does talk about dhyAna 
in 4th sUtra bhAshya.  dhyAnaM purusheNa kartuM, akartuM anyathAvA kartuM 
shakyaM ( exact words cannot recall, but it should be something similar to 
this!!). 

Hence there will be no 'doSha' from choosing one or the other options
provided by the shAstra. 

>  I agree that if anyathAkartuM is an alternative option provided by 
shAstra itself.

Of course, if one refrains from either of the options, within a main 
karma, there will be karma lopa.  This kind of dosha/lopa is there for any 
act/abstinence, even laukika. 

>  Yes, but shAstra vihita vidhi/nishedha plays an important role in the 
sAdhaka's path unlike laukika 'akartuM' option :-))

Anyway, this topic is not directly related to 'aparusheyatva of veda-s', 
so let us stop this discussion. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
