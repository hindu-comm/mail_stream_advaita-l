RV: But mimamsakas and vedantins tried to provide logical arguments in
favour of apaureshyatva. They did not ask us accept it on faith or as a
given. They tried to reason why Vedas are apaureshya. They don't tell us
why only sruti is apaureshya and not any sentence. Or I don't understand
their logic correctly. But there was definitely an effort to prove it.

RV: Such an exercise will be like the Intelligent Design of the church.
Vedas hold a position on the origin of the inverse, life and languages.
Science holds a different position. We cannot say both are equally valid
and pair them up.
