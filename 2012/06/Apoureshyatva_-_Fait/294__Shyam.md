Pranams Shri Subbuji and others following this thread.

Abrief response.

Following this line of thinking we have to conclude that our SaptaRishis were barely done brushing their gorilla ape hair off their bodies when they received their revelations and we, with brainsfar more evolvedthan theirshave to take such revelations as pramana? And extending this further,in a hundred thousandyears,with monstrous foreheads to accomondate their nowenlargedprefrontal lobes,will ourdescendants now receive far better revelations of unauthored nature to guide Dharma?

I really think it isunwarranted to try and accomodate Vedic truths into the framework of evolutionary theory - not because of the reason that such an accomodation is impossible, which it is, but because such a evolutionary theory is mere flight of fancy and not anything that is established on factual basis.

If youhear amelodioussong, and asked me whois the composer,and I told you that different random sounds, gradually evolved from rudimentary notes, into more complex arrangements, and finally over many many centuries, manifested forth as this composition that you now hear, you would very likely advice me urgent psychiatric help. And yet there are many thinking individuals who, in the name of scientific thinking, freely consume of theabiogenesis/evolution Koolaid. 

Whatis readily evidentis that human clairvoyance has only deteriorated, severely at that, from the time of Vyasa, and in more recent history, Gaudapada and Sankara to our own modern times, and that Dharma as the Veda/Itihasas themselves express and predict, only deteriorates with the passage of time yugA upon yugA. 

May I humbly suggest that we are better off understanding scripture with a standpoint of faith, and approaching Science with a healthy scientific spirit of skepticism and rigor,instead of using logic toaccomodate an understandingof Scripture that is line with the current status of Science's ignorance. By its very definition Veda pertains only to that which is outside the purview of pratyaksha and Science by its very defintion deals with that which is only in the realm of pratyaksha.

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Apoureshyatva - Faith or Logic?

On this topic I have some questions that could get resolved by inputs from
learned members:


 1. If we have a situation where the Veda has to wait to get revealed
 till a proper Rishi evolves, then there is this question: Are there no
 human beings before such a special human being evolves to be called a Rishi
 to receive the Veda?
 2. In the Vedic or rather traditional thinking an evolution of a person
 is owing to his having practiced the veda vihita anushthanas and thus
 having qualified to the exalted status either in this or earlier birth or
 even in a future birth.
 3. If the vedas can get revealed to a Rishi, an evolved person, and only
 then get propagated and available for other humans, what is the fate of the
 humans who evolved and remained before the Rishi-human evolved and received
 the Veda?
 4. There is a verse: tenaivoktam nigamavachasA.....kArayAmaasa...which
 means: the Lord, what He Himself has said through the Vedas, got them
 spoken through the smRtis composed by others...Rshis, etc. for the benefit
 of humans.
 5. The BG verse 'saha yajnAH prajAH sRShTvA purovAchaH prajApatiH. anena
 prasaviShyadhvam eSha vo'stviShTakAmadhuk - says 'the PrajApati created the
 beings (especially the humans for whom the veda is addressed) along with
 the Vedas (containing the yajnas, etc.) and made them available for the
 humans to use the Veda for fulfilling their purusharthas.'
 6. If the veda has to wait till a rishi is evolved, the humans, the less
 efficient ones than the rishi, who evolved logically before the more
 efficient one evolved (progressive), will be deprived of the means to
 purushartha. This is unfair.
 7. The former Sringeri Acharya, Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha
 SwaminaH in His replies to the (modern-educated scientist) disciple who
 asked Him about the admissibility of the modern theory of evolution into
 the Vedic thinking exactly cited the above BG verse and had said that along
 with creation of humans the vedas were made available, along with many
 other points in support of His explanation. (see the Book: Exalting
 Elucidations (formerly known as 'The Jagadguru Replies' published by Sri
 Vidyatirtha Foundation, Chennai)
 8. In fact the BGB introduction also talks of the creation of MarIchi,
 etc. and the sanaka, etc. for the practice of pravRtti and nivRtti - the
 two-fold Vedic dharma for the benefit of the humans.
 9. The Vedic method is peculiar in that there are the Devatas who are
 admissibly highly evolved beings. Yet, these have become so only by their
 performing vedic yajnas, etc. which are also invariably addressed to
 devatas. Thus, there have to be devatas even before devatas come into
 existence owing to their past karma directed at devatas. That is the
 reason why an anAdi concept is invariably attached to creation, jiva,
 avidya, samsara, bandha, etc.
 10. There is the Br.Up. mantra: tad yo yo devaanAm pratyabudhyata,
 tathaRShINAm tathaa manuShyANAm ...which says that whoever from the human,
 rishi or devata classes comes to realize this Brahman, becomes Brahman,
 with sarvAtmabhAva. This mantra recognizes the categories of manushyas
 distinct from rishis and devatas.
 11. There is the statement of a krama sRShTi (a gradual creation) and a
 yugapat sRShTi ( a simultaneous creation of all beings) in the Veda. Both
 these are recognized by the traditon. The Mundaka mantra: tadetat satyam
 yathA sudIptAt pAvakAt visphulingAH sahasrashaH utpadyante...meaning: just
 as sparks, in thousands, emanate from the blazing fire, the various beings
 come into being. A similar mantra from the Kaivalya upanishad and the
 Br.Up are quoted to support yugapat sRShti. The Vedic sRShTi is always of
 the type where all the beings, with their classes and sub classes, are
 created, rather manifest, at the time of sRShTi, after pralayam ends. The
 Veda is also available at the very beginning for the humans to apply it in
 their lives. For, as soon as a child is born, or rather even before the
 birth of a child, the Veda-based rituals are to be performed for
 samskara.

Maybe members have suitable explanations to the above while accommodating
the evolution theory into the Vedic method. Also, a question arises: Is it
a flaw if for some reason the Veda apaurusheyatva/prAmANya is not
understood/explained logically within the context of the modern evolution
theory? My answer is: In the past there have been a number of jnanis who
have followed the Veda as the traditional pUrvAchAryas followed and
obtained freedom from samsara. The so-called illogicality behind veda
apaurusheyatva/pramANya did not come in their way of becoming
self-realized. The modern theory of evolution was completely unknown to
them.

Some loud thinking, to evoke further thoughts...
