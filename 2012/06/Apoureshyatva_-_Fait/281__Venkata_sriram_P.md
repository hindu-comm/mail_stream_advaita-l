Namaste,

Swami Tattvavidananda Saraswati, a great scientist in his pUrvAshrama, writes as:

///

The concept of apaursheyatva of vedas is, after all, not unscientic and not an irrational dogma. A statement or word, the veracity of which is not adversely effected by time
and space, is deemed to be universal law. It is called *trikAlAbAdhitaM satyaM*.
Such truths which existed before they were discovered and which will exist even if
man would forget them in future, are called reveletions. Veda is a bunch of such
reveletions, unadulterated by man's weaknesses. Vedas are considered to be
anAdi and ananta. This idea is again rational, because veda is a collection of
spiritual experiences and revelations of various sages from times immemorial
and the universal truths enunciated in vedas will be valid for ever. In this way,
Vedas are unique in their scope and content and are different from any other
book written by man.
