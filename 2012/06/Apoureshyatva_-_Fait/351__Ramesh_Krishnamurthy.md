I am talking about the ability to take into account something more
than just instinct (such as ethics) in one's decision to act, not act
or act differently. The common laukika view is that animals act on the
basis of instinct, and that only humans can take into account ethical
and other such considerations. The traditional association of
puNya-pApa with actions is based on this ability that humans have. In
general, tradition does not associate puNya-pApa with the actions of
cows, horses, etc

So the point is that it is this ability to rise above instinct and
take autonomous decisions on actions (on the basis of ethical and
other considerations) that makes the dharma puruShArtha relevant for a
jIva.

I am aware of this and it supports my argument.

So you accept that this 12th century Peruvian guy is a
dharma/mokSha-puruShArthI?

If yes, do you see that you are actually agreeing with my views?

As long as you are accommodating the Peruvian guy into the framework
of dharma and mokSha, you are essentially agreeing with what I wrote
earlier.
