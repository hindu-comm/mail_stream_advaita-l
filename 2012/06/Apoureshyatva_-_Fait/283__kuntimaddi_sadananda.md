Subbiji - PraNAms

Wonderful explanation. 
I was going to write exactly the same as Vedas themselves declare that they are also apara vidyaa. In addition not only Vedas even the objective knowledge is also apourusheyam, as I think Noble laurate Dr. Chandrashekar put it, in that even the scientific knowledge is dis-covered by intuition. Intuition is nothing but a mind in meditation. The Rishis are also veda drashtaas as veda (knowledge) is revealed to them when they are in meditation. Intuition is like jnaana kshakshu.

Hari Om!
