I thought my reference would have been obvious in my first post, but
will expand a little. It seems that people are more interested in
finding which page numbers references occur rather than to get the
basic idea which runs through the entire text of the bhAShya. Note
that the sAnkhyA theory of pradhAna modification is *not* from shruti.
It is formed by using tarka. Shankara makes it clear that his problem
is not the theory of creation per se, but rather pradhAna being
independent of brahman. While he could have claimed that this theory
was not found in the shruti texts and is obtained through tarka, he
merely remarks that the true nature of *brahman being the cause of the
world* cannot be determined by tarka. However if one wants to posit a
transformation of a substance such as prakR^iti as the cause of the
world, he is ok with it *as long as it is subservient to brahman*.
Positing such a theory is again through tarka, but making it
subservient to the fundamental tenet of vedAnta - viz brahman is the
cause of the world - makes it ok in Shankaras eyes. This is quite
different from what has been claimed, viz, "a theory of creation
cannot be determined by logic whether or not it violates the basic
tenets of vedAnta". Please go back and read what Ramesh and I are
trying to say.
