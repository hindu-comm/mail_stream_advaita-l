Coming to the 'kartum...' this has been said by Shankara with respect to
both laukikam and vaidikam karma.  That is, both these types of karmas are
'capable' of being done or not done or done in a different way. 'kartum
akartum anyathA vA kartum shakyam laukikam vaidikam cha karma.' (BSB 4th
sutra, if I am not wrong).

I think shankara  talks about 'dhyAna' (purusha tantra)  here not on 
vaidika karma in 4th sUtra.  Because for the vaidika karma shAstra is the 
ONLY pramANa.  Hence, akartuM anyathA vA kartuM invites 'pApa/dOsha' and 
more importantly shAstra viruddha.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
