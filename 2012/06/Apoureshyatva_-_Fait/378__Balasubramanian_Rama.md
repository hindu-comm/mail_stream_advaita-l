First of all, as Ramesh pointed out these are questions bereft of
context and we have to be careful in using such conversations.

That said, using your own logic, Sankara could have told the SankhyA
that there is no pradhAna since life was created and given some vedic
statements in support.  But no - all he says is that pradhAna cannot
be *independent* of brahman and also clearly adds that if the sAnkhyA
wants to posit a pradhanA which has that function they want of it, but
is subservient to brahman, he is acceptable to that view. It all boils
down to the fact that theories of creation are orthogonal (to use
Ramesh's phraseology) to what is important.

Can I ask you if you have actually read any pUrva-mImAmsA arguments on
apauruSheyatva? If yes, can you tell me which part of  the argument is
contradicted by any theory of evolution, be it the pradhAna of sAnkhyA
or the modern evolution theories?
