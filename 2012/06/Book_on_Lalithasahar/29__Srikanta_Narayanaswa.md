Before doing parayanam of "Laitasahasranama"one will be richly benifitted by doing parayanam of "Lalitha Trishathi"which is an epitome of Lalitha Sahasranamam.The entire "SriVidhya"worship is condensed in Lalitha Trishathi,which describes the Mother as "Sarva prapanca nirmatri" and "sarva vedantha tatparya bhumi".
N.Srikanta.
