Namaste

It depends on Jnani's Prarabdha Karma. Some Jnanis may have some
habits before. But the habits will continue after Jnana.

Like some Jnani may have habit of drinking very frequent coffee and
tea and smoking also. He may not stop them after Jnana. Other Jnanis
like Krishna may have other habits like dancing and playing with
women. They are all Prarabdha only. This is why we must always follow
the oral instructions of Jnanis but we should imitate the acts when
the acts are not against Dharma. Other acts we should not imitate.
