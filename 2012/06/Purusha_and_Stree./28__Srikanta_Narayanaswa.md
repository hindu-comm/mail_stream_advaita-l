Like an earthly mother tells the child born to her as to who is its father ,Vedha Matha 
points to the Brahman as the cause of all causes.So from our loukika angle 
Brahman may be taken as Male Supreme.R.Krishnamoorthy.

shrutimAta is called vEda-garbhA, dhEnuH etc. 

The brAhmaNa who performs niyamapUrvaka swAdhyAya,the shruti in the form of chandas protects & nourishes him,like a mother. The essence of mAtr tattva is protection and nourishment. During swAdhyAya and tapas, the shruti nourishes 
the adheeta with saraH (in other words rasaH) and bestows chitta shuddhi. 

Such a mind which is endowed with chitta shuddhi is called *saraswAn* and his vAk is called *saraswati*.

It is wrong to say that the Vedas describe "Brahman"as either Purusha or Stree.Only the "apara Brahma"or the "Hiranyagarbha" is called Purusha.But, the Supreme Brahman is given the neuter gender.We see in Vedanta texts,though the name "Purusha"is given like in "Asango hi ayam Purushah"for "Atman",it is referred to by the neuter gender(napumsaka linga).In the Gaudapadakarikas,in the Agama prakarana,Gaudapada says that all the three lingas are used.So,Brahaman is niether Male,nor female,nor even neuter gender,it is something which is inexplicable(anirvacaniya),yet,Positive.It is the reality,uncontradicted in all the three periods of time.Yet,by the power of "maya",it can take all the forms.
