I am attaching below a couple of responses from the retired neurologist Dr.
Srinath Bellur who had written the article on Jivanmuktas cited earlier.
Sri V. Subrahmanian  had pointed out a couple of corrections needed in the
article.  Accepting those corrections, Dr. Srinath Bellur went further to
shed some light on the subject line Cotard Syndrome as a (retired) medical
professional.

The two sets of email texts are listed one below the other.  First, is the
explanation of Dr. Srinath Bellur about Cotard Syndrome. Below that is Sri
Subrahmanian's comment on the article pointing out some specifics in the
article and Dr. Srinath Bellur' s response.

Kindly go over this if you are interested.  My sincere thanks to Dr.
Srinath Bellur and Sri Subrahmaniam for their mails.

sincerely,

***Mail 1: Text by Dr. Srinath Bellur on Cotard Syndrome within the current
context


Incidentally, the mention of Cotard syndrome in the Subject-line of our
communications caught my attention.

I have attached below a useful link, which summarizes the cardinal features
of Cotard Syndrome, published in the current psychiatric literature:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7625193

>From a Vedantic perspective, Cotard Syndrome represents a state of
malfunction of the Antahkarana with ensuing symptoms that are characterized
by :  Brhama/भ्रमा (delusions), Pramada (Errors in judgement due to
delusions) and Aalassya (psychomotor retardation secondary to depression).
 As is well known, the Gita annunciates that Brhama, Alassya and Pramada
are the archetypical characteristics of Tamo Guna.  Thus, Cotard Syndrome
is the result of Prarabdha Karmas that result in an Antahkarana seeped with
an excess of Tamo Guna.

The Nihilistic denial of one's self and the Samsara surrounding one, seen
in Cortad Syndrome, is the product of Brhama(भ्रमा) and not Brahma Jnaana
(ब्रह्म ज्ञाना).

In Brahma Jnaana there is a total dissolution of Samsaara and one's
Dehabhimaana secondary to Svarupa Jnaana.  Just like the disappearance of
the snake with a correct knowledge of the rope.

Whereas, in Cortad Syndrome there is no Svarupa Jnaana but a mere Brhanti
on account of which Samasaara and one's own Deha may appear unreal or
absent.

There is total Mano Nasha in Brahma Jnaana, with unending Bliss.  However,
despite denial of one's self, or the surrounding Samsaara, there is
continued functioning of the Antahkarana in Cortad Syndrome. Thus, Cortad
Syndrome is always accompanied by extreme distress, depression and intense
psychological pain.

I do hope you will forgive my unsolicited comments regarding Cortad
Syndrome.

Despite being retired, the Vasanaas of my being an ex-neurologist just wont
shut up.

With warm regards to all,

Srinath
