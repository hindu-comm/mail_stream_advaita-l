Though I have not read these books, I have heard of Appayya Dikshitar's
'madhva tantra mukha mardanam', and one or two more titles, an attack on
Dvaita.  These have been 'replied' too by scholars of that school.
Dikshitar has also authored another work 'chatur mata saara sangrahaH'
dedicating one section to each of Advaita,  Shiva advaita, Vishishtadvaita
and Dvaita, showing how each of the last three can be progressively leading
to Advaita.  This is published and available.

And another 'mANikya manjari' by a more recent author, a retaliation to the
'maNi manjari' of the Madhva school.  This is more of a character
assassination than a work on the philosophy.
