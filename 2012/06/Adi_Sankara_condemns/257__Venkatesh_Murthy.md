Namaste

Adi Sankara lived many hundred years before Ananda Teertha who is Madhvacharya.

But Adi Sankara has condemned Madhvacharya's Jagat Nimitta Karana
Vada. Madhva is saying God is Efficient Cause of World but not
Material Cause.

This is against the Vedic teaching and it is Veda Bahya non Vedic
teaching may be coming from Agamas.

In the Sutra Bhashya 2-2-37-

Tasmat Aprakrutir Adhisthata Kevala Nimitta Karanam Ishwaraha Ityesha
Paksho Vedanta Vihita Brahmaikatva Pratipakshatvat Yatnenatra
Pratishidhyate |
Sa Ceyam Vedabahyeshwara Kalpana Anekaprakara ||

God cannot be acting like a Superintendent of Nature and Souls. If He
creates Superior, Mediocre and Inferior creatures he will have defects
like likes and dislikes.

Then He is no God at all.

Questions - Which Agamas accept God as Efficient Cause only? Did
Madhvacharya read the above condemning from Sankara Bhashya? Why did
he still say God is the Efficient Cause only?
