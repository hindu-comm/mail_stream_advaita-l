Subbuji - PraNAms

swaruupa guaNa may be contradiction in terms. 

In essence swaruupa is not a guNa - like H2O is not guna of water - it is necessary and sufficient for H2O to be water and water to be H2O. Similary satyam - jaanam - anantam is necessary and suffient for Brahman. Since Guna requires a locus which is different from Guna, and since Brahman is non-dual it cannot have guNa. In Advaita Makaranada Lakshidhara kavi argues that sat is not guna since if it is guna it should have a locus for it to be which has to be different from sat. Only thing that is different from sat is asat and asat cannot be locus for sat. Further is asat has to exist it should have sat which is again a guNa and we run into infinite regress. 

Just my 2c

 But the svrUpa guNas are not of prakRti.
They have a category of apraakRta.Only bodies made of prakrti transform
and perish but not apraAkRta ones.
