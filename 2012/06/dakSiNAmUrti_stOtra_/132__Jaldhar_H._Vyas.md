If Atharvaveda = tantra = "black magic" then it might be plausible.  If 
you remember over a decade ago there were a number of ritual child murders 
in UP which led to widespread panic about "tantrikas"  If I recall 
correctly the chief culprit arrested was a Muslim.

Vasanta Panchami is a somewhat important utsava in Bengal which is what I 
assume he means by "the North" though if Gujarat can be considered north 
it is less significant for us.  Saraswati puja is done on that day and it 
is a tradition as part of it to read the first rk/sutra/shloka of the 
various shastras.  (This is actually part of the brahmayajna which should 
be done daily but for many this might be the only day in the year they do 
it.)  Even then I have never heard of the upanishads being read especially 
not this Allah upanishad which it seems only came to notice due to the 
Theosophists who are totally unreliable as informants.

Did Schrader ever even visit India?  I think he was one of that old 
fashioned breed of Indologist who did all his research in Sanskrit from a 
desk in Germany.  Most of these comments seem to be based on garbled 
gossip he might have heard or read about from people who actually had been 
to India.

Having "established" that it was accepted in North India there had to be 
some explanation right?
