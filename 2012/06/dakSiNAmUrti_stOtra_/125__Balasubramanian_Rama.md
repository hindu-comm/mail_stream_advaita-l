First of all, I think you need to understand some basic mImAmsA. No
one is blindly following any Sanskrit shloka. This is the sUta samhita
which has been accepted as pramANa buy shiShTas such as Vidyaranya.
What is an "authentic" scripture comes from shiSTAchAra and not by
relative study of texts by oneself and discarding shlokas which do not
*seem* correct. Then there is no point in calling a text prAmANa -
instead we become the pramANa! When a straightforward interpretation
does not seem correct one has to look for other avenues of
interpretation, Please consult the tantra-vArttika and such texts on
mImA.nsA.

That said, let us accept that there is a whole lot of tantra which is
essentially advaita, if not exactly the same, and advaitins have no
problem with that. So the verse must essentially be pariplava of a
certain mArga or must refer to some tantric text(s) which is not
advaitic. Surely you must agree there are branches of tantra even
within the shAkta paradigm that do not agree with advaita. I don't see
any problem with this verse. People interpret texts literally without
understanding how to interpret them - this is a very Western concept.

The example of Allah upanishad is irrelevant since shiShTAchara - not
just in advaita but everyone else - does not recognize Allah
upanishad.

That said I think you need to examine yourself and ask why you need to
engage in Dennis Rodman like trash talk in any discussion.
