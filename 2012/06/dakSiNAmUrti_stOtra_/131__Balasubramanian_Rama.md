It is quite a ridiculous theory for various obvious reasons, and is not supported by any evidence save this very assertion of Schrader. The other footnoted claim that the Atharvaveda is "nearly unknown in Southern India" is perhaps more true though gratuitous and unnecessary to state as a cause of the lack of acceptance of the अल्लोपनिषद् in the South -- why not grant that people there (like the unnamed former librarian of the Adyar Library) do not accept the text because they consider it spurious, a view held by Schrader himself?

Shrisha,

You are right. Moreover the Atharva veda is as known or unknown in the
North as well as the South. The recitation tradition was and continues
to be sparse.
