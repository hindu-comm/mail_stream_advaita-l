Recently I came across a book on the above Upanishad published by the Adyar
Library, in 1933 edited by the Pundits of the Adyar Library under the
supervision of Dr.Kunjan Rajah.  This 'upanishad' is listed no.5 of
'shaakta-upanishads'. It is very short and reads like a 'ghanam'
recitation.

This is just for information.
