Just like one puts into a trash can something called Allah upanishad even 
though it is titled an upanishad, 

praNAms Sri Satish Arigela prabhuji
Hare Krishna

'allah' upanishad is not on muslim god 'allah', 'allah' means sister, this 
upanishad is about devi mAta, though I have not see this upanishad 
personally, this is what I heard from the very reliable source :-))

I request someone,  who knows the contents of this upanishad,  to  share 
more information. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
