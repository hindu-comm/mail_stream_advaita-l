Dakshinamurthy gave Vidya and Jnanam to Lakshmi and Saraswati.

//

The essence of the teaching is that vaidika mArga & upaniSad vidyAs are
superior to tAntrika mArga and tAntrika rituals. The *abhEda-bhAvana* 
of upAsaka and upAsya dEvata is the uttama mArga which culminates
in advaita siddhi.

This is what Acharya Sankara took from sUta saMhita. Acharya studied sUtam saMhita
18 times before writing sUtra bhASya and sUta saMhita left an indellible mark on 
Him.

regs,
sriram
