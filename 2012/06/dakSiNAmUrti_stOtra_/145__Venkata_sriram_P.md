According to that verse there are two types of shruti. 
One type is the Veda (Nigama) and the other type is the Tantra (Agama). 

//

The above statement is from kulluka bhatta. However, Devi Herself says in Devi Gita as:

dvividhA mama pUjAsyAt bAhyAbhyantarApi cha
bAhyApi dvividhA prOktA vaidika tAntrikI tathA

vaidikaschApi dvividhA mUrti bhEdEna bhUdhara
vaidiki vaidikaiH kAryA vEda dIkSA samanvitaiH

tantrOkta dIkSa vadbhistu tAntrikI saMshritA bhavEt
itthaM pUjA rahasyaM cha najnAtvA viparItakaM

Devi says that:

I am fond of 2 methods of worship. One is external worship and other is internal. 
The external worship is again of 2 types : One is vaidika mode and other is tantrika.

So, the sAdhaka who is initiated in vaidika mode should only worship Me with vaidika paddhati only. And the sAdhaka who is initiated in tAntrika mode should only worship Me
with tAntrika paddhati only. A vaidika initiate should never tread the tAntrika path also a tAntrika initiate should never tread the vaidika path.

The rough translation goes as:

Even though some of the smritis & dharma shAstrAs have the mention of tAntra, it should
not be taken as a pramANA by the vaidikAs who consider shruti as the parama pramANa.
So, the sAdhakAs who opt for mOkSa and whose objective is chitta shuddhi and mumukSatva, should only consider vEda as parama pramANa. 

Devi says that I am the Supreme Queen of this Universe and this is the command to be
followed by everyone.
