What is the basis for this statement? Which tAntrika-s do you speak of? Have you met all of the tAntrika-s or did you learn about all the tAntrika paths to make this statement?. Are you sure all tAntrika-s have the same opinion on the matter?

Perhaps you could clarify these for a start and we will see if more detailed discussionis required.
