Definitely.  However in the popular imagination, if you ask the man in the 
street anywhere in India, tantra means spells for making money, seduction 
or harming an enemy.  As we have seen even Shankaracharya who was 
certainly well acquainted with higher tantric philosophy assigns some 
sorts to the tamasika worship of bhutas and pretas.

I agree.  It must be acknowledged though that for many tantrics the 
acquistion of power--spiritual yes, but also material--is an explicit 
goal.  The reputation though sensationalized is not entirely without 
basis.

Most of the contents of the Atharvaveda are the same rks found in other 
shakhas but there is also a lot of material concerned with "magic."  that 
is quite different from the grhya/shrauta vidhis.  So it has developed a 
reputation in some corners as being the origin of the tantras particularly 
by those eager to show their harmony with the Vedas.

It is not just there though.  We recently discussed how in the concluding 
parts of brhadaranyakopanishad khilakhanda there are procedures for 
compelling a women to have intercourse and to ensure the birth of a son or 
a daughter.  There is a whole class of Vedangas called vidhanas which have 
vidhis for "magic" using the mantras of their respective shakhas.  This is 
probably one branch of ancestry of the tantras.  In fact when M.S, Bhat 
wrote his edition with translation of rgvidhana he called it "Vedic 
Tantrism."

I did not mean to bash Muslims but what struck me about that story was 
there should be such a thing as a Muslim tantrik at all.  It seems rather 
infertile ground don't you think.  But this shows how Tantra is not more 
of a conceptual framework that expresses itself in different religions 
rather than being a particular religion itself.  So there are "Hindu" 
tantras both Vedic and non-Vedic, Jain tantras, Buddhist tantras, and 
apparently Islamic tantras.  And sometimes the votaries of these different 
traditions recognized the kinship but other times they were just as 
inclined to sectarian squabbling as non-tantrik traditions.  But to get 
back to the main point, if one can make the equation Muslim = tantrik and 
Atharvavedi = tantrik than the conclusion Muslim = Atharvavedi is simple 
(though wrong) to make.

This is why I think it is just based on gossip from his informants rather 
than any solid research.  If he actually was in India its even more 
inexcusable.

The Arya Samajists no but the Theosophists maybe.

No because you can have a general rule with particular exceptions.

Tantrikas (or bhaktas or yogis) get moksha if and only if they happen to 
be Advaita Vedantins.  This is what it means as far as we are concerned to 
be in harmony with Shruti.

Right.  Not as is.

Could be.  And in other cases the flow was the other way around.  The same 
with the Buddhist tantras and non-tantric Buddhism etc.

Not at all.  This is simply the editorial process.  As I mentioned before 
the dividing line between "inside" and "outside" is not always sharply 
defined but it does exist.  This is what the shloka in question says.

Maybe so but you cannot deny that historically they have been more 
secretive and exclusive.
