Namaste,

Acharya did what you mentioned, in the first half of his life. Later on he wrote the Laita Trisati Bhashya (a Samayachara tantric text) as well as Saundaryalahari. Also please consider Gaudapada's works such as Subhagodayastuti and Srividyaratna sutra.The past acharyas have not belittled the Samayachara in any way. On the other hand the Tantra considers itself superior and calls its privacy as akin to the privacy of a honorable lady and it says that the Vedas are open like public woman. Just telling you the other perceptions. Any comment?

Regards,
Sunil KB

Subject: [Advaita-l] dakSiNAmUrti stOtra from sUta saMhita


//
Dakshinamurthy gave Vidya and Jnanam to Lakshmi and Saraswati.

//

The essence of the teaching is that vaidika mArga & upaniSad vidyAs are
superior to tAntrika mArga and tAntrika rituals. The *abhEda-bhAvana* 
of upAsaka and upAsya dEvata is the uttama mArga which culminates
in advaita siddhi.

This is what Acharya Sankara took from sUta saMhita. Acharya studied sUtam saMhita
18 times before writing sUtra bhASya and sUta saMhita left an indellible mark on 
Him.

regs,
sriram
