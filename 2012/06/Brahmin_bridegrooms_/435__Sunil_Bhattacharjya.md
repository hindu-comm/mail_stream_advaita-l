Namaste, 


In the same vein one may aske what was the Varna of the sage Vedavyasa, who had a brahmin father (Parashara) and a Kaivarta mother (Matsyagandha turned Satyavati).

It is very true. One can never be sure, maybe beyond three generations
backwards about the varNa of one's ancestors unless family tree records are
maintained. Someone known to me, a brahmin, has a close relative who has
married a non-brahmin girl. He says: after six years of her living in this
house, she gets the varNa of this family. I do not know if there is any
scriptural support for this. In any case, I am also told that some
Peethadhipathis have said that brahmin boys may marry vaishya girls if
there is no other option. But then what varNa does the offspring get? I
suppose there are some specific varNa names for the offspring of such
marriages. I remember to have seen some of these names in the
Br.Up.Bhashya/or gloss. Someone may pl. show that.
