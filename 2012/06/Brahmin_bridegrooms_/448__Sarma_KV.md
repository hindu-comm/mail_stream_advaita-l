The only school run completely under Sringeri Sharada Peetham is Jnanodaya
School. It is the second out of the *two* educational institutions run by
the peetham (there is a Jnanodaya PU college also, but it is run from
within J'School campus.)
The other school - the The  Women's Peace League School - has a certain
kind of close affiliation only.

See the list under "Educational Activities" in this link:
