If at all martial arts is the requirement of the hour, then why not
learn the oldest of all martial arts- Kalaripayattu? The art form was
introduced to the world by Bhagavan Parasurama and 21 of his best
disciples(all brahmins) were made as the heads of the kalaris he
established. Kalaripayattu is considered the mother of all martial
arts and even Bodhi Dharma was an expert in this art itself. It has
over 3000 years of documented history. Wouldn't it be more suitable to
learn such an art which has its origins fixed to a brahmin?
