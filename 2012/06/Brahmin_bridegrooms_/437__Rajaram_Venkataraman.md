The solution is exceedingly simple. Brahmin boys should be intelligent in
managing finances whether they do vaidhika or secular profession. They
should work out right from school or gurukula days. My karate master
Shihaan Husseini used to say,"My students should be fit and masters in
karate like the priest in ashtalaksmi temple". I strongly recommend the
following for all normal healthy individuals of any age who have doctor's
permission to exercise.

The boys should know Kama Shastra before getting married. They should abide
by dharma like Rama. The daughter-in-law should be treated with affection
by the patents-in-law. The girls should in their heart of hearts accept
their in-laws like their own parents.
