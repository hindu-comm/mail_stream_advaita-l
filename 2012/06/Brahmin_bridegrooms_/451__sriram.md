Dear
The reluctance of father/mother /both to marry off their daughter to a 
vaidhika brahmana also contributes to this state of  affairs.Here the 
parents think that the status of a vaidhika brahmana is lower in society not 
due to absence of wealth but it is perceived to be lower for declaring in 
society that their son -in-law is a vaidhika brahmana.Iam no exception.
So also a businessman as a son -in-law is only a second or third 
choice.Parents want their daughters to be well above wants and also society 
accepted status levels.May be there is no logical reason but it is 
there.Like preference for a fair skinned girl to a swarthy.These are all 
unexplained but these prejudices do exist.Only education by our Upanyasa 
Karthas -like our Velukudi Krishnan Swamigal -will remove this type of 
prejudices.R.Krishnamoorthy.
