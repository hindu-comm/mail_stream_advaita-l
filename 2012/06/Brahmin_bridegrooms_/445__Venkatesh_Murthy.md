Namaste Sri Bhaskar

I think you must always use Information Technology in this day and
age. I cannot live without Google search. I depend on it very much in
my daily life. You can also find all information by Google. Some
people say Google is God. He knows everything. If your Admin is
preventing Google search it is too bad. He must be like a Rakshasa
because he is preventing God into your life. You have to ask God.
