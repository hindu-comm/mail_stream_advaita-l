Well questions related to puranas and the intersection of science and 
dharmic concepts are not totally irrelevant though perhaps they are not 
the direction a sadhaka should be headed in but thats something 
individuals have to work out for themselves.

Call me an idealist but I think someone who wishes to pursue Advaita 
Vedanta should be able to restrain themselves without the services of a 
babysitter.  If it turns out they do I'll reluctantly step in but I'd 
rather not make that the first resort.

I fervently wish it were true but unfortunately it _is_ a stretch for 
many.  Somewhere along the line a large number of Hindus lost the ability 
to be anything but passive consumers of their past and traditions.  They 
need retraining not haranguing.  Or perhaps both.  But atleast if they are 
asking questions it is a good first step.
