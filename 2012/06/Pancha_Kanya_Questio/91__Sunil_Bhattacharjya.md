Grammatically you may be right. I was referring to the perception in those days also, meaning that Lord Krishna was definitely aware of this fact towards the end of the Dwapara yuga and that is why, instead of trying to get Ashwatthama killed, he recommended an enduring punishment for Ashwatthama. Hope you agree.

Sincerely,
Sunil KB
