We have to first reflect on their supernatural birth as kanyas, which frees
them from mundane laws. Arjuna, in his visit to devaloka, considered
Urvashi to be his mother as he was the son of Indra and refused her amorous
advances. He did not realise that Urvashi was acting as per her apsaras
dharma and it was he who rejected his purusha dharma. So, she cursed him to
become an eunuch. It is a different matter that Krishna changed it to a
boon. So, the importance of their supernatural birth as kanyas cannot be
overemphasised. But they also teach practically for all levels of women.

For those at the lowest level, Ahalya teaches what a woman and her husband

At the highest level, Draupadi and Sita, show how pativrata dharma acts as
a protective shield against the most powerful aggressors.
