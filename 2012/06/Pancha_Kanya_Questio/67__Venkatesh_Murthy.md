Namaste

Ahalya Tara Mandodari Draupadi Seeta Tatha
Panchakanyaha Smaran Nityam Mahapataka Nashanam

The five famous Pativratas are Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Draupadi and
Seeta. Remembering them great sins will get wiped out.

 But there are questions.

1 Why are these five Kanyas? Are they Virgins?

2 Except Mandodari the four had contact with Para Purusha man other
than husband. But still they are great? Why?

Ahalya was Gautama Rishi's wife. Indra came in Gautama's disguise to
enjoy her. She knew it was Indra not Gautama but still she enjoyed
with Indra. How can she become  a great Pativrata?

Tara was Vali's wife but she lived with Sugreeva after Vali was killed by Rama.

Draupadi was physically handled by Dushasana.

I heard Mandodari married Vibhishana after Ravana's death. Is it
correct? I heard she said to Ravana once-  'I wish Rama was my
husband'.  Is this correct?

Seeta was kidnapped by Ravana.
