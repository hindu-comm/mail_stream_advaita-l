Namaste Sri Vidyasankar

A request.

Some artificial imaginary line has been drawn between Vedanta and
Sacred Sexuality in this list. But there is no line like this in our
scriptures. This is the effect of Britishers and Muslim invaders
thinking on Indian minds. In Bruhadaranyaka Upanishad 6-4 many details
of Sacred Sexuality are given.  It is equal to Vajapeya Yaga. We
should not be influenced by foreign thinking in this subject. We
should not behave artificially.
