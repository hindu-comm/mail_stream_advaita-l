The problem is that there are no references to original scriptures, no
effort to trace shlokas referring to the panca kanyas from the
respective purANas, etc. All I see is personal opinion masquerading as
shastras.

This is not discussion of shastras by any means - just verbal
diarrhea.  The latter is worse than not discussing anything at all.

No. The problem is there is no *self effort* to first trace scriptural
references and then ask questions based on those references. But I
don't see any such thing here. People just shoot off random nonsense -
whatever comes to their mind with no effort to connect up anything to
the scriptures. Surely it is not a stretch to expect someone to first
pick up the rAmAyana and see what it has to say about tArA before
spouting off about tArA. Would anyone here go to a physics class and
spout random junk the about General theory of relativity, or first
consult a book? But looking at the level of nonsense going on,
particularly in this thread, I should perhaps not be surprised if that
actually happens.
