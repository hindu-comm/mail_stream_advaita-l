Dear friends,

Any idea on what count Mahasati Anusooya is left out if Pativrata is the criterion for Panchakanya.. Further why was Rukmini left out? Was Rukmini any way lesser than Seeta? Was Kunti not a Pativrata even when she obeyed her husband at all times and she wanted to immolate herself when Pandu died. It was only because Madri said that she (Madri) was responsible for Pandu's dearth and she (Madri) should be given the chance to expiate her sin then and then only Kunti relented. Furthetr Madri asked Kunti to look after her two sons when she was gone.. So one has to look for the real criteion for choosing the Panchakanya.

I think Kunti deserves to be considered as the foremost of the Panchakanyas.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Pancha Kanya Questions

The five famous Pativratas are Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Draupadi and
Seeta. Remembering them great sins will get wiped out.

But there are questions.

1 Why are these five Kanyas? Are they Virgins?

praNAms Sri Venkatesh Murthy prabhuji
Hare Krishna

It seems you have innumerable ir/relevant questions on women, sex etc. in 
this exclusively dedicated advaita forum :-)) Anyway, since you are 
getting answer to your doubts irrespective of subject from the scholars of 
this list, I look forward to the better explanation/interpretation to this 
shlOka from Sri Vidya prabhuji, Sri Jaldhar prabhuji, Sri Anand Hudli 
prabhuji, Sri Sriram prabhuji, etc. No need to mention, after reading 
your explanation, I am also getting the doubt, how can these women be 
kanya-s & pativrata-s!!!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
