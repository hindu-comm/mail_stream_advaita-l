Namaste Sri Bhaskar

I am trying to answer your below question how Puranic episodes can be
relevant to us.

In Puranic stories there is first entertainment value. It is sugar
coating the medicine we have to take. If some body gives you bitter
medicine and says eat it it will be difficult. But if he gives
medicine tasting sweet every body will eat it.

In Agni Svaha story I think the Principle is the Siva-Sakti
Priniciple. If Siva is united with Sakti he becomes Complete.
Otherwise he is not complete. The Saundaryalahari has said 'Sivah
Saktya Yukto'. The Siva Sakti combination is same as Brahman of
Vedanta. Like this Agni is Complete when he is united with Svaha. We
cannot separate Agni from Svaha in a Homa. We have to say Agnaye Svaha
Agnaye Idam Na Mama only. We cannot say Agnaye Idam Dadami or
something. It is wrong. It is a serious mistake. We will not get the
Phala of the Homa.

Another point is the Saptarshi Seven Stars in the Sky. The Vasistha
star is closely followed by a small star Arundhati. If some one says
there are Seven Stars and one more you may not remember it. But the
story is like sugar coating and you will digest and remember it for a
long time. When the husband shows the Saptarshi and Arundhati to his
wife she will always remember to be united with the husband. When the
husband and wife are united there will be prosperity. They have to
together do Yajna and other karmas. They will get Shreyas.

If some one tells you Agni has to be with Svaha you will not
understand. But when there is a nice story to explain you will
understand and remember it.
