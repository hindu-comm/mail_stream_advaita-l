Quite frankly, I wish the moderators would come down harder. A few
people including the instigator of this ridiculous topic have managed
to get this list down to a screeching halt. In the past I would just
wait till people like this got tired of ranting and left. And the list
would go on as usual with its good threads. Now there are about 5
people who have the most postings in any given month, who just will
not stop. Any topic under the sun will elicit 50 posts from these
folks. And the topics that come up for discussion have gone from bad
to worse. I have kind of given up at this stage. Why are people going
on and on about topics that have 0 relevance to this list?
