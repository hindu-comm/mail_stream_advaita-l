About Draupadi's exemplary behaviour there is an episode in the
Mahabharata/Bhagavata:

When Ashvatthama killed the five sons of the
Pandavas while they were asleep, Arjuna chased after him and brought
him back to the Pandava camp bound by ropes.  Krishna wanted Arjuna
to kill Ashwatthama. But Draupadi prostrated before him saying
he was the Guru, meaning the son of the Guru, Drona, is
but a Guru too. She pleaded that Arjuna should not
make Drona's wife (KRpi) weep like Draupadi was weeping at the loss of her
sons at that time.

The narration of this part of the episode is sure to
bring tears to the one who hears it. Draupadi exhibits such
a great character that can hardly have a match.

Arjuna looked at Krishna who indicated that Arjuna should somehow
satisfy both Krishna who wanted Ashwatthama dead and Draupadi who
wanted him alive.  Arjuna cut off Ashwatthama's shika and the Mani on
Ashwatthama's forehead.
