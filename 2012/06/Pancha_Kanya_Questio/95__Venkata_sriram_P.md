Ahalya Tara Mandodari Draupadi Seeta Tatha
Panchakanyaha Smaran Nityam Mahapataka Nashanam

//

What is the source of the above sloka nobody knows and moreover this has been
wrongly propagated in tradition.

The original sloka is in Uma Samhita (chapter 10) as:

ahalyA draupadI sItA tArA mandOdari tathA
nitya yauvvana saMpannAH panchakanyAH guNAnvitAH

All five are ayonijAH. 

If the logic of bramhacharyatva of kriSNa and nityaupavAsa lakSana of krOdhabhaTTAraka durvasa can be understood, then one would have the relevant samskArAs to under the
kanyatva of the above mahAsAdhvIs.

sriram
