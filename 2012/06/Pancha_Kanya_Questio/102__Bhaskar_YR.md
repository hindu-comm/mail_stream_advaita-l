sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Jaldhar vyas prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Well questions related to puranas and the intersection of science and 
dharmic concepts are not totally irrelevant 

>  I do completely agree with you prabhuji, along with shruti, itihAsa & 
purANa-s are also valid means of knowledge in brahma jignAsa.  But my 
question is how the questions like 'how many times rAvaNa physically 
touched seeta??  how many times agni discharged & how many times  his wife 
collected it by hand to store on the mountain top??  how ahalya cooperated 
indra though knowing he is disguising her ?? etc.  would help us to pursue 
our learning in the direction of advaita vedAnta!!??     IMHO, questions 
like this & resultant discussions  would not going to help us anyway to 
understand the 'real purport' of purANa-s.  Anyway, this is only my 
personal opinion/observation  prabhuji.  Being a moderator of this list, 
your goodself is the better person to adjudge which is suitable & which is 
not for the discussion in this forum prabhuji. 

Call me an idealist but I think someone who wishes to pursue Advaita 
Vedanta should be able to restrain themselves without the services of a 
babysitter.

>  Yes, but sometimes, a thorough person too needs a professional 
counseling to get rid of his/her psychic attachment to wild subjects :-)) 

>  Kindly pardon me prabhuji for stretching this further. 

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
