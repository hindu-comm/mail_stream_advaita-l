The five famous Pativratas are Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Draupadi and
Seeta. Remembering them great sins will get wiped out.

 But there are questions.

1 Why are these five Kanyas? Are they Virgins?

It seems you have innumerable ir/relevant  questions on women, sex etc. in 
this exclusively dedicated  advaita forum :-))  Anyway, since you are 
getting answer to your doubts irrespective of subject from the scholars of 
this list, I look forward to the better explanation/interpretation to this 
shlOka from Sri Vidya prabhuji, Sri Jaldhar prabhuji,  Sri Anand Hudli 
prabhuji, Sri Sriram prabhuji,  etc. No need to mention, after reading 
your explanation, I am also getting the doubt, how can these women be 
kanya-s & pativrata-s!!!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
