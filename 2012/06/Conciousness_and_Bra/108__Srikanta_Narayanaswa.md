There is the Mundaka sruthiwhich describes the state of a Mukta;
Itsays:

Bhidyate hrdayagranthih chidyante sarva samshayah!
Ksheeyante ca asya karmani tasmin drstye paravare!!.
"The knots of ignorance in the heart become broken,all the doubts are cutasunder
his(the sadhaka's"Karmas"become estinguished",when one has the vision of highest Truth.The Rishi does not give the details of what that vision would be.It may be akin to the divine Yogic vision when the Kundalini power reaches the "Sahasrara chakra".It is a function of the heart rather than of the brain,as Ramana describes it.The Buddhists also describe that the enlightenment is a function of the heart.Tey say that they can communicate with the heart.
N.Srikanta.
