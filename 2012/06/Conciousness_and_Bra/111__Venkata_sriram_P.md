Namaste,

///

It may be akin to the divine Yogic vision when the Kundalini power 
reaches the "Sahasrara chakra".

The *hridaya-granthi* which is referred in muND.upa. refers to chit-jaDa-granthi. And this knot of ignorance is in hridaya sthAna (daharAkAsa).

There is an upaniSad mantra for practice of dahara vidyA which was expounded by Shri Paramashivendra Saraswati in *dahara vidyA prakAsika*. 

regs,
sriram
