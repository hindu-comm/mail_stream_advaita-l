It appears that you are not saying that discovery is an act. You are
talking about discovered things. That's true. But, why go that much ? Even
things which are not discovered are not man made. Start from earth,
universe, flowers, etc.
But, this is not what is meant by apauruSheyatva of veda-s.
Then ?
Whenever we talk about apauruSheyatva(un-authored-ness) of specific
shabda-s, called veda-s, then we mean that it is not uttered without
hearing similar shabda.
For example, when you utter a sentence which was said by kAlidAsa in his
work, then you don't become it's author. So, we say that whoever utttered
veda-s did it after hearing it from others. So, no one is it's author.

Concept is not veda. veda-s are words. So, what you say is not the
apauruSheyatva discussed in scriptures. It is a new personalized version.
