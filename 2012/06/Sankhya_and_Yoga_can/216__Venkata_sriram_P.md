Namaste Venkateshji,

//

Even though the Guru is a boy or attached to materialistic enjoyments
like food, drink, women and others or he is a Fool or he is Servant of
someone or he is a Gruhastha living with wife and kids we should
neglect all these bad things and listen to his teachings

Isn'tthe above statement contradictory to the shruti vAkya *tadvijnAnArthaM sa guruM 
EvAbhigacchEt samitpANiH shrOtriyaM brahmaniSTaM* ?

IMO, it is arthavAda prayOga to *emphasize the humility of the disciple* and his *open mindedness to receive the teaching*. 

You might have heard that Jagatguru Dattatreya had 24 gurus and none of them were
the *enlightened beings*. Moreover, one among these 24 gurus was a prostitute. But, Dattatreya even learnt jnAna from this prostitute. So, what do you understand by thisepisode. It is the ever-learning attitude in the disciple and his open-mindedness which is most important. 

The dOSa in the guru is *to emphasize* the humilityofdisciple and hisattitudewhile learning which should not be taken in literal sense. 

Moroever, avadhUta gIta was taught by Dattatreya who was an avadhUta and ativarNAshrami. He Himself is known for the *vichitra leelAs* like moving with women, taking wine, roaming naked as an outcaste with 4 dogs behind etc. This charya of Dattatreya is to test how strong is the disciple'sdevotion towards Him. These incidents of putting His disciples to test are mentioned in Dattatreya Charitra. So, obviously, it is evident that He is teaching 
His own avadhUta charya. 

regs,
sriram
