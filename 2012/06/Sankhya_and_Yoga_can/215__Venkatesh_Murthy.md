Namaste Sri Sriram

In Avadhuta Gita Second Chapter it is said the bad qualitiies of a
Guru like Vishayabhogarata have to be neglected.

Balasya Vapi Vishayabhogaratasya Vapi Murkhasya Sevakajanasya
Gruhasthitasya Etad Guroho Kimapi Naiva Chintaniyam | 2-1

Even though the Guru is a boy or attached to materialistic enjoyments
like food, drink, women and others or he is a Fool or he is Servant of
someone or he is a Gruhastha living with wife and kids we should
neglect all these bad things and listen to his teachings.

Sri Subrahmanian has said -
Taittiriya says: yAni asmAkam sucharitAni tAni sevitavyAni, no itarANi.

If every Guru Jnani is behaving very perfectly all the time why is the
Sruti saying this? Because even the Guru will behave in a bad way
sometimes. But we should not follow it. We should follow the good
behaviour only.

It is correct Jnani will not trangress Sastra but sometimes he may do
it. Then we should be careful.

However, with this incident (if it is true !), we are blessed with a beautiful stOtra of lakSminarasimha called *lakSmI-narasimha karAvalaMba stOtraM* which we chant everyday.
