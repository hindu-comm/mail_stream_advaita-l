Namaste,

I understand that nishakaama-karma involves surrendering the fruits of action to the Lord (rather than abandoning action itself altogether). As long as we're in the body/maya, we need to perform action, and hence karma yoga is prescribed; for it purifies our minds, helps us earn God's grace.

My question is: what sort of action is one to perform? Most of us are stuck in mundane, dead-end jobs, so wouldn't nishkaama-karma be a little weird? If my means of livelihood involves maintaining accounts, how would such a mundane activity translate into karma yoga? Social work, artistic work, politics etc. may be suitable, but how about regular jobs we do?

Regards,
Suresh
