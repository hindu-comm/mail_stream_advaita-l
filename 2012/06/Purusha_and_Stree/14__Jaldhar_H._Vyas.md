This is the first time I've heard a South Indian mention it but it is a 
common tenet of North Indian varieties of Vaishnavism.  For instance the 
followers of Vallabhacharya maintain that all the Vaishnava saints indeed 
all bhaktas are incarnations of gopis who are the paradigms of bhakti. 
For the most part this is just a theological idea but in extreme cases 
some have become transvestites out of zeal to emulate the gopis.

At the stage where everything is purush there is no dvandvas like 
male-female at all.

Neither.  You need to stop taking these things so literally.
