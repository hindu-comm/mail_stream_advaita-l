taittirIya AraNyaka (aruNa praSna) has - napuMsakam pumAn strI asmi. sthAvaraH
asmi atha jangamaH. (I have broken up sandhi for ease of reading.) "I am neuter,
male, female. I am unmoving and also that which moves."

The ways of SrutimAtA and her smRti duhitA to verbally convey that which is
vAcAm agocara do not appear strange to me; they are delightful and beautiful.
The close juxtaposition of such mutually contradictory attributes is found in
numerous instances and contexts.

It awakens the hearer's awareness very effectively and forces a readjustment
of one's thinking, sometimes drastic, if one is to make sense of what one hears.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
