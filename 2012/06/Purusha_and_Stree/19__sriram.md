Dear
Shruthi is called Matha -mother-because She points to Brahman.Sengalipuram 
Brahma Sri Anantharama Dikshithar used say Vedha Matha-.Like an earthly 
mother tells the child born to her as to who is  its father ,Vedha Matha 
points to the Brahman as the cause of all causes.So from our loukika angle 
Brahman may be taken as Male Supreme.R.Krishnamoorthy.
