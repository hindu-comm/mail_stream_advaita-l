Namaste,

/////////////

But in the Purusha Sukta there is a mantra 'Purusha EvedaGm Sarvam |
yad Bhutam Yac Ca Bhavyam | '. 'Everything is Purusha That which was
and That which is to be is Purusha'.

If everything is Purusha there is No Stree at all.

/////

These interpretations are the distorted versions which indicate lack of knowledge of nirukta & veda bhASyAs. 

There was person ( i don't remember now !) who interpreted *puruSa* of puruSasUkta to be a male and *srI* of srI sUkta to be female. So, to maintain the balance of gender, one must study both puruSa & srI sUkta so that justice to both puruSa & stree can be equally done !

God save such souls !

regs,
sriram
