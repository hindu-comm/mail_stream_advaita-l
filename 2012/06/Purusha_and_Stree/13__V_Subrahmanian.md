Sir,

The first position is said from the jiva point of view.  In bhakti-based
dualistic systems the characterization of the jiva as stree is common.
Even in the AksharamaNamAlai of Sri Ramana Maharshi the aspirant is likened
to a woman who places the garland on the beloved.  But all this is from the
dualistic point of view.

What the Purusha sUkta says is from the ParamAtma point of view.  It says
that everything, the whole creation, is nothing but the Purusha.  Here it
is like: all the products of gold are nothing but gold.  For the portion:
puruSha eva idam sarvam, Sri Raghavendra Tirtha (of the Madhva school)
while explaining has cited a smRti: yadadhInA yasya sattA tat tadityeva
bhaNyate: that which is dependent on something else for its very existence,
is said to be that (latter) only.

Actually such a characterization amounts to saying, in Advaitic terms: the
superimposed serpent has no existence of its own; its existence, sattA,
depends on the sattA of the rope.  When we say 'the serpent is'  the isness
belongs to the rope alone.   So, when the rope-knowledge arises it is said:
that which is serpent is none other than rope: PuruSha eva idam sarvam.
