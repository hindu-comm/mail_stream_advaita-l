Namaste,

This is a sensitive matter. Let's say a person suffers from various neurological disorders like asperger's, ADHD, OCD etc. It is not physically taxing but mentally and emotionally so. It cramps him, keeps him away from normal life - can't make friends or do regular work and earn a paycheck, must be indoors most of the time, depend on others even as an adult, face ridicule as a result etc. etc.

My question is, how does a person in this horrible situation do sadhana? Even regular life is upset by such disorders, so how will he practice bhakti, karma, jnana and such lofty things when he constantly feels cramped? Also, how does an advaitin see karma in this case?

Regards,
Suresh
