Under the guidance of a compassionate guru, depending on the severity of the neurological disorder,
and with appropriate medical help. It is not impossible, only perhaps a bit more difficult. 

In some ways, people who have some handicap or the other may be better placed than the regularly
functioning human being, to appreciate the force of "I am not this deha", which is the first and most
important step in sAdhana.
