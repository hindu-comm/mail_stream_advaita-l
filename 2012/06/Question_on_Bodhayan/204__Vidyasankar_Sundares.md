Nevertheless, the sphoTa vAda of bhartRhari is rejected by Sankara in
the brahmasUtra bhAshya. vAkyapadIya is a work on grammar and its
author, bhartRhari, should not be confusd with bhartRprapanca, a pre-
Sankaran vedAntin who held a jnAna-karma-samuccaya view and who
has been refuted by Sankara and sureSvara.

The vivarta of Sabda-brahman, as delineated in vAkyapadIya, is also not
the same as the vivartavAda of advaita vedAnta. 

Finally, if bhaTTikAvya is to be attributed to bhartRhari, that view goes
directly against the story that makes bhaTTi a half-brother to bhartRhari
and to vikramAditya and vararuci as well. All in all, the legend recounted
in patanjali carita cannot be taken as anything more than a charming 
story. No philosophical or historical conclusions can be drawn from it.
