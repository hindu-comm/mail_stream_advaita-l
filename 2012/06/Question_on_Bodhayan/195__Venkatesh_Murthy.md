Namaste

If Upavarsha's Vrtti is not available today there is another question.

Ramanuja is following Bodhayana Vrutti because he is saying that in
the Sri Bhashya. Then is it true Bodhayana Vrutti is agreeing with
Visistadvaita?

Is it correct to say Adi Sankara's Bhashya is following Upavarsha's
Vrutti? He may be Advaiti with some differences from Sankara Advaita.

The Visisitadvaitis may be trying to show Bodhayana and Upavarsha are
the same. Their goal is to show Advaita Bhashya will not have support
of any earlier Vrutti.
