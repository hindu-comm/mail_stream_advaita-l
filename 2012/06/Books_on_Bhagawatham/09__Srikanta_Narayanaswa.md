Sri.Vidyashankar,One correction.
I am sorry to say that you have misquoted me on the erotic sculptures outside the temples.It was youwho had said the following lines:

These were the sentences you had written,and I simply quoted them.
What I was driving at is that in the Kavyas like Ramayana and Mahabharatha,there is a kind of 'poetic freedom"which are not taken in other epics.Whatever we may analyse,we cannot go beyond what Sage Valmiki and we have to keep within the bounds of what he has said.Any interpolation or extrapolation by a reader or a commentator is his own,and we cannot allege it on Valmiki.
N.Srikanta.
