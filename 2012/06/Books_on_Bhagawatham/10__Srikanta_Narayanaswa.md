The above conclusion of SriSriram is wrong.I didnot say that there was Sringara rasa between Ravana and sita.Santam papam.I regard Sita as the divine mother and any such entertainment is a sacrilege.I too belong to Srram,s group.What I said was any interpretation untoardly beyongd what Valmiki wrote in the kidnapping episaode is a mere 
extrapolation,and we cannot attribute any thing based on subjective analysis.We have to take what Valniki has written at its facevalue.
