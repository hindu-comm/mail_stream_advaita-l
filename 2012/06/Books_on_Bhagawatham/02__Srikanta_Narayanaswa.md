It is wrong to think that eroticism is unholy or atrocious. Within the standard
parameters of Indian literary and other artistic conventions, eroticism is not
something to be abhorred always. In fact, SRngAra is often said to be the
king of rasa-s in traditional Indian discussions of aesthetics. It is a sign of
the continuing colonization of the Indian mind that many amongst us cringe
at the very mention of SringAra. We have to stop alienating ourselves from
our own culture.

Pranams.Well said Vidyashankarji.It is very much true that the continuous colonisation of the Indian mind that many amongst us cringe at the very mention of Sringara.Sringara rasa is also included in the Bharatha natya sastra.It would be sheer hyprocrisy if we say that we donot entertain the shringara rasa.
Recently,I had a chance to go on a piligrimage to Orissa.I visited Puri,Konark and Bhuvaneshwar which has the famous Lingaraj temple.In all these temples,erotic sculptures
are not only carved,but,also in solid form.I asked a Panda about the sculptures.He said,"Ee Shraman hai"By his explanation,I could understand that when Buddhism was spreading in these places,many youth abandoned homes and family life and becames "Sramans"In order to discourage the youth from turning to ascetism
,these sculptures were carved.Also,Tantric rituals were practiced in these temples.It was Ramanujacharya in the 12th century who tried to introduce "Pancharatra"mode of worship.But,he could not succed.Even now,the "Vaikhanasa'and Tantirc mode of worship is followed,without the "mithuna" and "madhya"offering to the devotees.Instead of "madhya"devotees are given tender coconut water.The "Devadasi"natya was also abolished 
years before.
