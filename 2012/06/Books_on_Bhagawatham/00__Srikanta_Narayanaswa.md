Pranams,Sri.Sarmaji.

I am sorry i was not able to bring my points across.What I was saying is that there are certain instances in the Ramayana which we as earthly beings cannot understand.The episodes in the Valmiki Ramayana regarding Hanuman visit to the harem of Ravana is well recorded and is in details.At present I am not able to quote the specific verses regarding this.
Sage Valmiki was a poet,and such descriptions by a poet is justified,from the point of view of "Alankara".





There is also a verse,where Sita rebukes Rama as a person in the garb of a Woman!Now, can we say that Sita ,an eptitome of "Pathivratha Dharma"can make such a insulting statement to Rama,who is "Maryada Purushottama".Sita,was also a human being,and her statement has to be seen as a one coming out of a woman,who is also human,though an avatar of Lakshmi Devi,the consort of Vishnu.Sita,being a woman was infatuated by the desire of possessing the "Golden Deer",the "Maya mrga"though Lakshmana knew that it was a "Maya mrga".But,Sita used unbecoming words to insult Lakshmana,and even suspected,Lakshmana's integrity!Now,can we take exception to these episodes?
N.Srikanta.
