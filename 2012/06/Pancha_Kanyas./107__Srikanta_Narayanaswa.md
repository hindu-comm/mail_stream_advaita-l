Actually,the order by which the "Panchakanyas"are described is as belos:
"Ahalya, Draupadi,Sita,Tara,Mandhodari(actually it is (Mandhodari)Tatha!
Pancha kanya smaran nityam mahapathaka vinasanam!!"
These are given prominence for their qualities.Ahalya was the innocent wife of Gautama muni.But,only Indra out of lust molested her.That is why when Rama stepped on the stone (Ahalya was cursed to turn into a stone),she came to life,Draupadi was also innocent when Dushyasana derobed her in the sabha,she underwent many sufferings,yet,she prayed to Krishna to save her,Sita the concert of Rama was the epitome of Pathivratha Dharma,Tara the wife of Vali,even though when Vali was killed by the arrow of Rama,Rama blessed her,Mandhodari also was blessed by Rama when he killed Ravana.There is a beutiful conversation between Rama and Mandhodari who pleaded with Rama to forgive her husbands' sins,Rama extols the qualities and warriorship of Ravana.Rama also arranges for the cremation of Ravana,who was a Brahmana.We see in all these cases of the "Pancha kanyas"they had the divine blessings.Ahalya,Sita,Tara,Mandhodari had the blessings of Rama,Draupadi had the
 blessings of Krishna.Hence,they are hailed as "Pathivrathah"
