>The self is self-evident. We all know it and that is why we go about
getting clarification from the sastras.


It is only verbal knowing. In reality if you realize this, then sastras are not required and you do not go about getting clarifications.


> Now, the sastras remove ourignorance about the self.
Yes, ignorance can only be removed by jnana.

> We may start with the assumption that the self isformed at the time of birth and destroyed at death.
This is charvak philosophy.

>The sastras teach thatthe self is eternal. We accept it on the belief that sastras form a validpramana and our acharyas interpret them right.

The validity of sastra pramana is different from other pramanas.

>Now, sastras say that theself is nameless, formless, attributeless etc.

They also tell us that it has thousand names (Vishnu sahastranAm) ,It has all the forms (Rama and Krishna as humans) and attributes as well.

> We accept all these on thebasis that sastras tell us. Now, how do sastras know that the it is theright thing to negate names, forms etc.?

It is just as you know that your name is Rajaram.


>They should have a positiveknowledge of brahman just as we know that rope is real and snake is simplysuperimposed on the rope but that is not possible for sastras becausebrahman is not an object of knowledge like the rope. Hence the question.

Tulsi ramayana says that idam and ittham of brahman cannot be known and one cannot have positive knowledge of brahman. All are just pointers to that supreme reality.
At times where the knowledge ends or fails, what carries is the scriptures and it is the faith which carries there after. That is why as a source of knowledge it is aseparatecategory called shabd pramana, different from other pramanas.Hope this helps.
