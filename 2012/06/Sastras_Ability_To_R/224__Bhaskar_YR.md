My question is how can sastras have a positive knowledge of Brahman so 
that they can teach us what is and not Brahman?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

shAstra does not teach brahman as such & such a thing!!  it only removes 
the ignorance that jeeva has on brahman due to avidyA.  shAstra just 
removes the avidyA and as soon as this avidyA goes self-evident Atman 
shines on its own.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
