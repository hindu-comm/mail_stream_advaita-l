Dear
All this boils down to asthikyam.There should be Brahman -Athatha Brahma 
Jingyasa:Begins Brahma Suthram.What does this mean?There is 
Brahman -accepted-and let us analyse is the meaning.Nobody will analyse a 
nonexisting thing.Similarly sastras have accepted vedic sayings and give 
instructions as to what to do and what not to do.It is difficult to say 
Brahman is this but easy to say this is not Brahman.Your question is how it 
is acceptable without knowing positively what is Brahman.This is somewhat 
similar to proof by employing a reasoning called reductio ad absurdum.You 
assume something as correct but end up ina result which is absurd.So it is 
proved that the assumption was wrong.Similar is this approach.Sastras derive 
their inputs from vedas and observed phenomena and are positive that there 
is Brahman.Brahman is anirvachaniya.So they employ this nethi nethi 
principle on absurd conclusions.I hope I could throw some light on this 
thinking process.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Yes - hence my question. If you have to teach me that a clay pot doesn't 
shine, you have to first know what a clay pot looks like. How can the 
sastras have a positive knowledge of brahman to negate non-brahman?

My question is how can sastras have a positive knowledge of Brahman so
that they can teach us what is and not Brahman?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

shAstra does not teach brahman as such & such a thing!!  it only removes
the ignorance that jeeva has on brahman due to avidyA.  shAstra just
removes the avidyA and as soon as this avidyA goes self-evident Atman
shines on its own.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
