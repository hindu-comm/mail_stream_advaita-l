It is quite simple, really.

brahman is to be known as oneself, the Atman. There is no "positive"
knowledge of brahman other than as oneself. A study of
Atma-anAtma-viveka followed by a study of standard mahAvAkya vichAra
through bhAga-tyAga-laxaNa should clarify such questions.

One should also look carefully at the method of adhyAropa-apavAda.
Negation is always of something that has been previously
super-imposed. Ultimately, one arrives at that which is non-negatable
(the Atman), and knows brahman to be none other than the non-negatable
Atman.
