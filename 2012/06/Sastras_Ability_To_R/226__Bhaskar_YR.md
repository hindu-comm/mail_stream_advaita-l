No, as mentioned, even shAstra-s for that matter,  quite frankly admits 
that it cannot teach brahman positively as such and such a thing...yato 
vAcho nivartante aprApya manasa saha,  na tatra chakshurgacchati, na 
vAggachati nO manaH, kO addhA veda ka iha pravOchat, kuta AjAtA kuta iyaM 
visrushtiH??  See, shAstra here expressing its inability to show us 
brahman as an objective reality.  So, shAstra's scope ends till the 
dispelling of ajnAna.  since Atman is not an adventitious thing, no 
pramANa is required to 'show' this to us.   

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Yes - hence my question. If you have to teach me that a clay pot doesn't 
shine, you have to first know what a clay pot looks like. How can the 
sastras have a positive knowledge of brahman to negate non-brahman?

My question is how can sastras have a positive knowledge of Brahman so 
that they can teach us what is and not Brahman?

shAstra does not teach brahman as such & such a thing!!  it only removes 
the ignorance that jeeva has on brahman due to avidyA.  shAstra just 
removes the avidyA and as soon as this avidyA goes self-evident Atman 
shines on its own. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
