How is this possible with respect to brahman?

//

Vedanta gives an example called *bhramara-keeTa nyAya*. The catterpiller thinking of 
wasp, becomes the wasp itself.

So, brahma (Atma) tattva should be understood intellectually first with yukti. 
Later, upon understanding, it should be meditated upon. This meditation results
in adidance in it which is evident with the shruti vAkya *AtmAvArE shrOtavyaH mantavyO
nidhidhyAsitavyaH*. 

Now, the crux of the problem here is that every tom, dick & harry listens to vedanta, attends the lectures etcand think themselves to be vedAntins. Though, *shubhEccha* is developed in them, but this doesn't mature into manana. So, where lies the problem is a pertinent question? 

When the 1st sUtra of brahma sUtra says *athAtO brahma jinAsA*, a lot of brain-storming session has been conducted by sampradAyavAdins regarding the word *athAto* which speaks of the *adhikAra nirNaya*. Karma, bhakti & upAsana are the steps that make the sAdhakabloom as a mumukSu.Thus, when pratibhandhakAs are removed and chitta shuddhi is attained, such a sAdhaka has control over his senses. Thus, he is called *dhIraH*. *dhIraH* means the one who has complete mastery over his senses and mind. To him, brahma-tattva through the method of negation (niSEdha paddhati) is taught. 
Having assimilated that tattva, he meditates on THAT and becomes THAT (AtmAnaM matvA dhIrAH na shOchati.....).

regs,
sriram
