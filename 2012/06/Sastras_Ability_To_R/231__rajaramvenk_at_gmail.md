You are going around the core question. As I was thinking about it, I got the answer but still curious what the sampradaya position. Do sastras know what is Brahman? They cannot because they are words only but Brahman is beyond words. Then how can they remove our ignorance about Brahman? Even if I don't know what a pot is, I can answer correctly the question "Is this a pot?" if I know what is not a pot. Sastras know what not Brahman correctly and hence can dispel our ignorance on what is brahman.

right. Now, sastras say that the self is nameless, formless,

It is not that the shAstra merely negates names and forms. What it
negates is the tendency for objectification, which is a much broader
canvas. Words like "nameless" and "formless" need to understood
properly. For example, air is formless, but this formlessness itself
is an attribute and hence objectifiable. The case of the Atman is
different.

The self is self-evident but any kind of objectification of the self
is not self-evident, and hence not satya. What the shAstra does is to
help us "give up" or "let go" of the tendency for objectifying
oneself. Hence your question is ill-posed - it presents the shAstra as
trying to tell us something which it never intends to.
