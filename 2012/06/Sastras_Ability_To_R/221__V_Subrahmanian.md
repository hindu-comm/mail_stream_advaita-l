Teaching Brahman thru negation 'neti neti' is the method of the upanishad
and not exclusive to Advaita.  All schools accept this.  Even if the
world/objects are not declared mithya as advaita does, to show Brahman as
different from the world/objects, this method of neti neti is
indispensable.  And the knowledge of Brahman is available from the
upanishads themselves: as jagatkaranam, shaashvatam, jnana svarupam, etc.
whereas the world/objects are anityam, created, duhkha mishritam, jadam,
paricchinnam, etc.  With this much knowledge one can negate the objects and
differentiate brahman from them.  It is only to acquire aparoksha jnanam of
brahman one has to do extra sadhana.  To negate the objects as not brahman
one need not have aparoksha jnanam.  Aparoksh jnanam only destroys mula
avidya.  The destruction of avidya is not a sine qua non for negating
objects as not brahman; it is a must, however, for moksha.
