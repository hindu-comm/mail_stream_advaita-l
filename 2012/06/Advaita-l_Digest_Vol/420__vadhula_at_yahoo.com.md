Dear Sri Ram,

But many in Shudra jatis in India may not accept this. In fact they probably will not enter into matrimonial relationships with new converts.

However, my Rg Veda AchArya Brahmasri Narendra Kapre Ji mentioned verified from the prasthAna-bhEda of madhUsUdana saraswati and he vouchsafed the *re-conversion into shUdrahood*.

Sir John Woodroofe undergone tAntrika mahApUrNAbhiSeka rite which is the highest form of initiation given in tantra mArga.

The last few slokas are prakshiptAs.  Till Sir Brown discovered this, none of our scholars pointed out.  He was also a srividyOpAsaka who translated Saundaryalahari into English.

He republished some of the extinct works in telugu and brought them to limelight.  And the same works we are teaching to our telugu children in schools.  Brahmasri Janamaddi Hanumath Sastry (whom i know personally) is taking care of this valuable library where Sir Brown's telugu works are displayed which include some of the rare research works on mahAbhArata, rAmAyaNa & telugu avadhAna prakriya, vEmana shatakaM etc.
