Response:The Vishishtadwaitins believe that the aspirant after saranagati and at the time of death the Vishnu dutas carry in "Ashta buja"and take him to the Vaikaunta,where if he is luck can get a glimse of Vishnu reclining with the Goddess of wealth.There are also gradations in mukti.If he is of a higher order in the ladder,he ia previleged to witness the Apsaras like Urvashi,Rambha,Tillottama and receive their royal treatment.However,the Vishishtadwains donot say he will attain vishnu loka prapti,but say,"he reached Acharyan Thiruvadi"!
