Sorry for the inconvenience.

The last line in my previous mail should read as "Hence Brahman is said to be Inexpressible" instead of "Hence Brahman is said to be Indescribable."

It follows from the above that concepts like 'maya, avidya etc.' are in fact dispensable in Advaita - they are merely explanatory artifacts to satisfy a curious mind. Hence Brahman is said to be Indescribable.
