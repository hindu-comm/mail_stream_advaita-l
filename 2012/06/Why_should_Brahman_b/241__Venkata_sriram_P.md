Dear Sarma garu,

//

All this is because of our selfishness

//

upAsakAnAM hitArthAya brahmaNO rUpa kalpanA .......So, we should not say that it is out of selfishness, saguNa rUpa has been created. 

BTW, the category of devotees which you have mentioned to be selfish, can we put them into the lower strata of devotees as *arthArthi* about whom Bhagavan Krishna mentions. 

Nevertheless, they need some maturity to evolve themselves but cannot be rejected outrightly !

regs,
sriram
