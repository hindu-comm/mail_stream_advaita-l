All this is because of our selfishness. We want god to be approachable,
have ears
to hear our pleas, have form so that we can see him, have a compassionate
heart to sympathize
with our needs etc. Thus we want a saguna Brahman. But if he is just one
like us how can he fulfill
our desires? So we want him infinite (formless) Omniscient, Omnipotent,
Omnipresent so that he can know,
be capable of immediately deliver our desires. Man creates his God is a
saying not without some merit.
