Dear Sri Suresh
Advaitam means there is no other object otherthan Brahman.Sarvam 
Brahmameva.If it is admitted that Brahman had attributes,forms etc it will 
mean there is objectification.That is you and Brahman become different which 
is not the case as per Advaitha.It may become Vishishtadvaitham or 
Dwaitham.Hence advaitha sticks to nirgunopasana of Brahman.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Why should Brahman be without form or attributes?
