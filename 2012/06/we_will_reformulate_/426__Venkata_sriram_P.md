Just out of the topic, hope again this won't spin off several posts !

This is regarding afamous sampradAya pravachanAchArya in Andhra Pradesh (name withheld for privacy).

The nephew of this acharya is a doctor by profession who holds post-doctoral degree and an accomplished surgeon. He is a doctor who doesn't care for money and performs operations free of cost to the poor people. Also takes nominal fee in clinics. His intention is to uplift rural areas and make them aware of health & sanitation. 

Apart from his profession, he performs regular sandhyAvandana, shiva panchAyatana pUja, brahma yajna & swAdhyAya daily. 

For the past 5 years he has been searching for a suitable girl to marry but none of the
brahmin families are willing to give away their daughters to this person. 

Do you why?

The conditions of this doctor who is asadAchAri are the girl should observe:

1.Should observerajaswala niyamAs strictly as per the dharma sindhu
2. No parties / outing 
3. No cinemas
4. No onions / garlic in food
5. Should assit him in cooking mahAnaivEdya daily for dEvatArchana

Having listened to these conditions, none of the educated girls are willing to marry him.

This poor doctor has been waiting for a suitable match for the past 5 yearswith a hope !

sriram
