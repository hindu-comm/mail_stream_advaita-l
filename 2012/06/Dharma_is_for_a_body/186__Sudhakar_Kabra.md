>Dharma is moral action for a body.
(Yoga is a "Higher Dharma" for the mind, but that's a different matter).

Dharma being an act, there has to be a karta. The phala of dharma accrues to the karta as per the bhavana it is being done and the proper procedure prescribed in the scriptures. Incidentally yoga is not a higher dharma of mind..
The result of a finite act will always be finite.


>Then how is it that Dharma, which is moral or ethical actionenjoined on the body, actually helps with Self-realization?


Dharma helps to attain chitta shuddhi, which is required for the shuddha jnana to arise.


>H.H. Chandrasekhara Bharati MahaswamigaL says (I think in His biography, am quoting the gist from memory here) that the Shastras enjoin action for which the results cannot be seen. Onetherefore performs the action with the belief that the result maybe achievedin another life (different from the present one).This raises the conviction that the Self is NOT the (present)body!


>In other words, by performing the rituals that are enjoined by the Vedas, one automatically obtains the conviction that the Self and the body are different!

Even after getting the conviction that the self and the body is different, the result is still incomplete. The ultimate proclamation of the vedanta is "you are that" - and that is achieved by jnana through realization only.

Dear Sri S.Jayanarayanan
If one behaves according to the dharma of their body will it not mean that there is identification of athma as a dhehi ?
I think better it is if said that dharma of their ashram.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Dharma is specific for a given body. "Sankara" in the body of the king behaved perfectly according to the dharma of a king or ruler.


> IMHO, justification like this can be given on each & every questionable activity of the person whom we believe he is jnAni or our Acharya, is it not??


Not so. Just as Sankara in his original body behaved perfectly according to the rules of dharma of a Sannyasi, so too we would expect all Acharyas (and indeed everyone) according to the dharma of their body.

I cannot speak for subjective views of arbitrary people.


> For that matter, the author of DV does
not provide this type of justification for shankara-s 'sva-varNAshrama
viruddha activities'. Instead, shankara here defends his stand (with
regard to his parakAya pravesha) on various other grounds. And the
author does not give even a hint for us to believe that shankara here giving
an opportunity to his disciples to prove their guru bhAkti. OTOH,
he emphasizes, shankara in king's body, completely lost himself and was
enjoying 'nirargaLa brahmAnanda' from the sexual relations with antaHpura
stree-s!! He also says, shishya-s of shankara had to sing 8 different songs
to wake him up...And even after realizing his true svarUpa shankara in
DV does not say anything about apparent & temporary forgetfulness of
his real nature for the sake of his shishya-s. If shankara's forgetfulness
is for the noble cause, I wish the author of DV could have said it somewhere.


Again, that is not unlike the Valmiki Ramayana where Brahma had to "remind" Rama of his real nature being Vishnu. Valmiki Ramayana also does not say Rama's ignorance is apparent.


> Anyway, I heard this type of story even
in vishnu's varAha avatAra also. In this case nArada had taken the
trouble to take vishNu out of varAha, which was enjoying happily with wife
& kids in the gutter :-))

>> In fact, Sankara even says in the Dig-Vijayam, "I am equal to Maha-Vishnu".

DV exaggerations, is brahma, vishNu, maheshvara svarUpa for us. Hence
the chanting gururbrahma, gururvishNu gurudevO maheshwaraH..
