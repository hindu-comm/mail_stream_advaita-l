Dharma being an act, there has to be a karta. 

praNAms Sri Sudhakar Kabra prabhuji
Hare Krishna

You are absolutely right.  A body can not act on its own as it is jada.  A 
kartru / bhOktru would decide what to do what not to do with the body. And 
'dharma' cannot be restricted to ONLY 'deha' dharma, dharma needs to be 
followed kAya, vAcha & manasa. 

thanks for your inputs.

Hari Hari Hari bol!!!
bhaskar
