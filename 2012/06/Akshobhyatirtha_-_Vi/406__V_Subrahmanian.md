In the past I had announced about a book on the above topic
negating/refuting the Madhva thinking on the event and establishing that
such an event never took place.  This book is available at the address
below:

Shri G.R.Patil,
'Chandragiri', Block No.15,
Near Kalidasa Hostel,
Opp. Bharati Akhada,
Rajatagiri, Dharwad 580004

Book name: 'Akshobhya vijaya vibrhrama'  Rs.150

He has written another small book subsequent to the above after some people
wrote to him with their objections.  This book is 'Vidyaranya vishayaka
aakshepa nirAsaH' in Kannada. Rs.50.

Both these books can be sent to you if the amount, along with some courier
charges, is sent to the above addres byPostal Money Order/Demand Draft.

He has confirmed the availability of these books.
