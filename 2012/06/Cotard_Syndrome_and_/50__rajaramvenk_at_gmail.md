When I say the sukshuma sarira survives death and functions "normally", I obviously don't say it continues to control sthula sarira. By normal functioning I mean the sense if self (ahankara), taking decisions (buddhi), feeling (manas) and seeing etc. (indriyas). According to mainstream modern science, there is no sukshuma sarira. The sense of the self etc. are products of the brain function. Roger Penrose accepts this position but argues that brain function has to be understood using new higher order mathematics because it is complex. Ian Stevenson and his successor challenge this position by documenting cases of reincarnation. They are also offering theories physical mechanisms by which the personality (read sthula sarira) can survive death. I am all for a healthy dose of scientific scepticism but if living beings have two parts (gross and subtle) to it, I would like scientific research to focus on both. 

The question is not about the attitude of the jnani. We are talking about a situation where he has become insane after attaining jnanam. His manas and buddhi have lost their concentration and discrimination. With what does the jnani see in a detached manner?

Funeral karma-s are predicated on the belief that sUkshma SarIra continues
to function after death. The normality of such functioning is not a given. By
definition, "normal functioning" of sUkshma SarIra pertains to its control over
the sthUla SarIra. Having lost that control with death, the functioning of the
sUkshma SarIra can by no means be said to be quite normal.

I think you mean "sUkshma SarIra being fully functional."

As far as science is concerned, I would advise a healthy dose of skepticism 
about the accounts of memories from past lives and out of body experiences
that are in vogue today.

Speaking as an advaitin, I would advise paying attention to the fact that a 
number of terms are used in Sanskrit, all of which get lumped into the
word "mind" when using English. manas is only one of these words. Other
important terms are antaHkaraNa, citta and buddhi, the last of which is
traditionally associated with brain activity (when people say buddhi, they
typically point to the head, not the heart).

By saying the above, you are coming back to a live sthUla SarIra, not a loose
sUkshma SarIra that is independent of the gross physical body. Whether a
mind is functioning or malfunctioning as per conventional norms, if it is
housed in the body of a jnAnI, then the jnAnI sees it like everything else,
as a disinterested witness. Otherwise, the said person is not a jnAnI.

Vidyasankar
