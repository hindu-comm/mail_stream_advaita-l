Sukshma sarira does not function normally in absence of sthula sarira because the instruments of bhoga are not present. You may equate it with a state of something like dream where organs of action are not available.

Memories are not carried from one life to another normally.We start with a clean slate. It is a rare/ abnormal phenomena of memories of past lives being remembered.

objective world. I don't think sakshi sees like we do as it is devoid of
indriyas.
Sakshi sees even better because it sees a bigger picture. I repeat indriyas are not required for sakshi to see because it sees by its own light.
