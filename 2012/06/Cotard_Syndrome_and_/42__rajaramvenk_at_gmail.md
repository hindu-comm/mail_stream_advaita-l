Body and Mind influence each other. Whatever you cite are influence of body on the mind. You can also influence the body by controlling the mind. If you fully concentrate your mind on gayatri mantra, your BP will go up and then come down. It won't happen for non-bija mantras. You can also influence external events by your thought. There are few experiments being conducted to study that (intention experiment) though we know from sastras yat cintati tat prapti and bhavati. You can experiment yourself.

Ian Stevenson has documented cases of reincarnation. He was a great scientist not a Hindu or Buddhist who believe in transmigration of the souls with sukshma sarira (mind).  It shows mind is distinct from the body.

Nobel Laureate Kary Mullis studied astrology applying his scientific mind and shows its correctness logically. Karma theory is based on reincarnation, which implies mind is distinct from the body.

Even if you believe mind is simply a product of brain function, you should read Roger Penrose. He shows why contemporary Mathematics and Physics are not enough to explain mind.

Dear Sri Rajaram Venkatramani
I tend to agree that mind is a product of the brain only as intellect is.I 
had undergone administration of anaesthsia for a surgical operation and 
during this period there were no activity of the brain as discernible by 
me-mind-and I was not aware of any external activity.During deep sleep also 
this can be seen.Dreams come only when your brain is not fully asleep 
leading to mind`s supplying bizarre of jumbled thoughts.So mind also comes 
under brain`s function.Brain`s damage results in loss of memory etc and what 
we call mind becomes incoherent.
I am not a neuroscientist but I am researching on mano nasam and as per my 
thinking mind is brain`s activity only and sans brain no 
mind.R.Krishnamoorthy.
