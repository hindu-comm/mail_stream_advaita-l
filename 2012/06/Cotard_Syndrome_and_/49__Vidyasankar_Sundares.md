Funeral karma-s are predicated on the belief that sUkshma SarIra continues
to function after death. The normality of such functioning is not a given. By
definition, "normal functioning" of sUkshma SarIra pertains to its control over
the sthUla SarIra. Having lost that control with death, the functioning of the
sUkshma SarIra can by no means be said to be quite normal.

I think you mean "sUkshma SarIra being fully functional."

As far as science is concerned, I would advise a healthy dose of skepticism 
about the accounts of memories from past lives and out of body experiences
that are in vogue today.

Speaking as an advaitin, I would advise paying attention to the fact that a 
number of terms are used in Sanskrit, all of which get lumped into the
word "mind" when using English. manas is only one of these words. Other
important terms are antaHkaraNa, citta and buddhi, the last of which is
traditionally associated with brain activity (when people say buddhi, they
typically point to the head, not the heart).

By saying the above, you are coming back to a live sthUla SarIra, not a loose
sUkshma SarIra that is independent of the gross physical body. Whether a
mind is functioning or malfunctioning as per conventional norms, if it is
housed in the body of a jnAnI, then the jnAnI sees it like everything else,
as a disinterested witness. Otherwise, the said person is not a jnAnI.
