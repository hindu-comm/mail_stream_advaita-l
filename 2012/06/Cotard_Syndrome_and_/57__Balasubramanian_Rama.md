Moderators, can we please stop this particular brand of insanity?

Members, please first read advaita texts and try to understand them. I
am sick of these random emails connecting some scientific fact or the
other with advaita while at the same time showing a complete lack of
understanding of even things like sAdhana-catuShTaya.
