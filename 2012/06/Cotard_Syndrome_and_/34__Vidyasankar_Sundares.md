Yes, but so what? That does not argue against the material nature of
the mind. The subtle body goes on to the next physical body. Other
than manas and buddhi, the subtle body also includes the five sense
organs, the five action organs and the five prANas, in subtle forms.

"Mind vs. matter" is a dichotomy that is alien to Indian philosophical
thinking, but it has a long tradition in Western thinking. Neuroscience
is challenging that dichotomy nowadays in its own way.

And if modern science and the SAstra-s happen to agree on a point or
two, nobody is saying that they have to agree on every dotted i and 
every crossed t.
