RV: The entire set of karmas done after a person dies are on the belief or
knowledge that sukshuma sarira functions normally including distinguishing
between salted and unwanted food. It just loses its control to act on the
sthula sarira any more.

RV: Yes. It is the ability to carry memories which shows that memory is not
an outcome of brain function. It    is an essential attribute of the mind.
The ability carry memory in out of body experiences is also an argument in
favour of sthula sarira being fully functional.

RV: We both agree that sakshi knows though we differ on whether he sees,
hears etc. What is important is how does a Jnani see his (mal)functioning
mind?
