In Vedanta the concept of 'sAkShI' is a temporary one which is admitted to
aid one's ultimate understanding of the Pure Self, Atman. 

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I am happy to note that discussion threads in this list are coming back to 
the right track :-)) Though shruti says Atman/brAhman is sAkshi ( sAkshi 
bhutaH kevalo nirguNascha) ultimately he is kevala nirguNa.  sAkshitva in 
brahman is kevala adhyArOpita because the brahman what shruti finally 
advocates is na antaH prajna, na bahirprajna, na prajnAna ghana. sAkshitva 
is the method in the form of specific feature employed by the shruti to 
drive home the point that Atman is ekamevAdviteeya.  This also reminds me 
the kArika 1-18, which clearly  says all this is only a device employed 
for the purpose of teaching and there will be no duality whatever when 
reality is known. 

BTW, Sri Venkatesh prabhuji the word  'vikalpa' used by gaudapAda  in this 
kArika can be understood as avidya or misconception :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
