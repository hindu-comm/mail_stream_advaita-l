Dear Shri Rajaram ji,
Mind is synonym to Manas in Vedanta.Brain is synonym to Intellect in Vedanta.In BMI concept it is the intellect which is more subtler and controls the mind, and mind controls the body.It is to be noted that in the traffic of life the flow continues both ways or rather cyclic.With this introduction pls see answers inline:

I agree with Vidyasankarji.Intellect, mind and body are all three different things in Vedanta. Physically we may see body containing all these, but the areas of operation and subtlity are different.We cannot see itseparatebecause of attachment and all the shastras are making us understand this.

Brain = Intellect, Mind=Manas.It is the brain i.e. neural activity that controls the mind is also correct. If Penrose proves it. this agrees fully with our scriptural position.

Are you accepting re-incarnation? Pls state your position, because your sentence starts with: If we accept......

Knowledge is characterized by jnana. Renunciation is a by product of jnana.Jnana once if it occurs then it is not reversible. Eg: if you know a watch you know it. Chances are it will not be reversed.

Repetition of mantra gives tadatmya with the mantra and slowly mantra reveals itself at appropriate time. Meditation is an art of removing all spurious thoughts and concentrating on one single thought. With lot of tapas/practice it occurs like as you said with lot of exercise the muscle build up.

Jnani as sakshi is a witness.Sakshi bhava an occur only if you are disconnected.Mind cannot see the dysfunction of a sakshi but it is the other way around.
