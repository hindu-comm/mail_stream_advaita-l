RV: Sri Sudhakar also said that sakshi is the seer.  The sakshi always
witnesses. So, why is the jnani sometimes aware of his mind
(mal)functioning and not always? You have also added a small complication
to that position that the anandamaya aspect of the mind is awake even in
deep sleep etc. So, is it the sakshi that sees or an aspect of the mind?
