Thank you for your comments. I dont think Brain = Intellect and Mind =
Manas is  correct as per Vedanta. Manas, Buddhi and Ahankara along with
karma and jnanendriyas belong to the sukshuma sarira. On birth, I think the
sukshuma sarira gets fused with the sthula sarira. This is what makes us
think that they are non-different because when the brain is damaged the
functions of the mind and intellect suffer.

I accept reincarnation as true because of the following reasons:

1. Belief in our traditions
2. Validity of astrological predictions rests on the theory of
reincarnation due to karma
3. Ian Stevenson's painstaking research done with high degree of integrity
shows that there are genuine cases of past life memories

Reincarnation more than even out of body experience shows that mind is
distinct from body. Also, the logical difficulties brought out by Dr. Roger
Penrose with regard to the science of mind show that the simple assumptions
of modern science are unacceptable.

To see, you need the jnanendiryas which belong to the sukshuma sarira. The
jivatma itself, without the indriyas, cannot see. Hence, my assumption that
the mind sees the brain or the sukshuma sarira disconnected from the sthula
sarira sees the latter. The sakshi caitanya is one and for it to reveal,
there has to be a medium, which is the sukshuma sarira of the jnani. I am
happy to be corrected.
