Could you please explain this a bit more? People often say jnana is the 
foundation, and that bhakti merely helps purify us, and so on.

Hare Krishna

tyajedajnAna nirmAlyaM sOham bhAvena poojayet.  An advaita sAdhaka would 
not see any significant valley between paramAtma & himself.  His bhAva is 
that that which is being worshipped by him is in svarUpa nothing but HIM. 
Moreover, even dvaita bhakti at the initial stages in advaita sAdhana too 
plays an important role.  By dedicating the karma phala  to Ishwara, 
sAdhaka would gradually develop the vairAgya and this vairAgya finally 
leads him in the jnAna mArga. Hence, bhAkti is not an extraneous thing in 
advaita sAdhana.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
