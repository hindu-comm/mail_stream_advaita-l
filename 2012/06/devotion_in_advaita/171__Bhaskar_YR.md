Could you please explain this a bit more? People often say jnana is the 
foundation, and that bhakti merely helps purify us, and so on. 

praNAms
Hare Krishna

In short, bhakti is NOT a separate means to attain self realization.  Both 
karma & jnAna mArga / sAdhana  finely blended with 'bhakti' rasa.  Without 
IshwarAnugraha one would not get 'advaita' vAsana says an authority in 
advaita.  And krishna bhagavAn says he bestows the 'jnAna phala' to the 
jnAni-s and karma phala to the karmi-s.  So, bhakti is required in advaita 
sAdhana also and don't  think it is something entirely different from 
jnAna mArga.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
