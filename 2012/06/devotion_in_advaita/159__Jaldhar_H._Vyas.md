As you point out, the great acharyas of Advaita Vedanta were also bhaktas.
So that should be a big clue as to what matters.

Contrary to what some people suppose, Advaitins do not simply commandeer 
dvaita traditions of bhakti and add an extra layer on top, we have our own 
system.

"I am." such simple words but so full of implications.  Who is "I"?  What
does it mean to be?  We have inklings of these ideas.  For instance do
parents have ahamkara when the safety of their children is at stake?  The
idea of bhakti is to extrapolate and universalize these ideas.  Thus it is
the foundation of any type of Advaitic sadhana.
