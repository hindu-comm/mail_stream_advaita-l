Suresh - Brahman is indivisible as substantive of jiiva-jagat-Iswara, while Iswara exists in the mind of jiiva who thinks he is separate from the jagat and therefore Iswara who created that jagat, while still thinks that he is all pervading. In the advaitic understanding all divisions are recognized as mithyaa only. That is jnaanam.

Thanks, everyone, for the insights. When we say it is Ishvara who bestows jnana upon us, how is he different from Brahman? Why do we make a distinction at all?
