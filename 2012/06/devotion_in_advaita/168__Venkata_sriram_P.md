Namaste,

sUta saMhita says:

bhaktirbahudhA jnEyA bhavAnIsahitasya tu
anyA *vEdashiraHshraddhA* sAkSAtvijnAnadAyini....1

aparA shravaNashraddhA prOktA vEdAntavEdibhiH
itarA mananashraddhA nriNAM saMbhAvanapradA ............2

The rough translation of above 2 verses goes as :

1st sloka:

There are various types of bhakti. One form of bhakti is to meditate on
Lord Siva with the bhAvana that the Self is separate from Siva. 
However, there is also another form of bhakti. To contemplate on the
nature of Jiva, Jagat& Ishwara as explained in *vEdashiraH* ie., upaniSads.
The *shraddhA* in *vEdashiraH* eventually bestows AtmajnAna. 
The sAdhana for achieving this AtmajnAna is also called bhakti.

2nd sloka:

The shravana prakriya of mOkSa shAstra at the feet of guru is also bhakti.
The manana is also called bhakti. This manana which results in nidhidhyAsana
is also called bhakti. 

Hope it is clear now..

regs,
sriram
