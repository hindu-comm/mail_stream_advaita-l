Namaste.

I am looking for information about a book with the following details:

It is a book in Sanskrit titled 'TattvasangraharAmAyaNam' authored by Swami
Ramabrahmananda Saraswati.  The book takes up almost every episode in the
Ramayana and gives an adhyAtmic interpretation supported by Shruti and
Smrti references.  It is known that this book was translated to Kannada by
Vidwan Shri Gundanna Shastri during the period of the Mysore Maharaja Sri
Krishna Raja Wodeyar in the 1850's.  It is of 1000 pages in 4 volumes.  I
heard the Mysore Oriental Research Centre has some information about the
Kannada book.

Any information leading to the availability of these two books, Sanskrit
and Kannada, in any form, hard copy or digitized, is appreciated.  Someone
said the Toronto Library catalogue lists the Sanskrit book.  It is also
learned that a Telugu translation is available in Tirupati.

Search can be initiated in every possible source including the Digital
Library of India.

Kindly provide your help in this search effort.

Warm regards,
subrahmanian.v
