Namaste

Manu says:

2.238. He who possesses faith may receive pure learning even from a man of
lower caste, the highest law even from the lowest, and an excellent wife
even from a base family.

2.239. Even from poison nectar may be taken, even from a child good advice,
even from a foe (a lesson in) good conduct, and even from an impure
(substance) gold.

2.240. Excellent wives, learning, (the knowledge of) the law, (the rules
of) purity, good advice, and various arts may be acquired from anybody.

2.241. It is prescribed that in times of distress (a student) may learn
(the Veda) from one who is not a Brahmana; and that he shall walk behind
and serve (such a) teacher, as long as the instruction lasts.
