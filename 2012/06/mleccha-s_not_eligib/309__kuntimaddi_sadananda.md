PraNAms

I just saw Shivashankar/Lundgren mail. I have a fond memories of meeting him in person in Stockholm and almost had daily extensive discussions on Advaita Vedanta. He organized my talk at the local Hindu temple and we had after scrumptious South Indian dinner.  

He is more a Hindu than many Hindus I have met and more a Brahmin than many I know.

Hari Om!
