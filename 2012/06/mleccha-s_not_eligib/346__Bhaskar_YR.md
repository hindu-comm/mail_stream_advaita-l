2.241. It is prescribed that in times of distress (a student) may learn
(the Veda) from one who is not a Brahmana; and that he shall walk behind
and serve (such a) teacher, as long as the instruction lasts.

Kindly clarify whether words within brackets are translators 'extra' 
additions to the original Sanskrit shlOka!!??  IMHO, it should be a aparA 
vidye or loukika vidye and not vaidika vidye or vedAdhyayana.  I think, 
the statement ' in times of distress' shows that a distressed person 
should learn through whatever means  available to get rid of his 
sufferings.  Anyway, I welcome your clarification with regard to this.
