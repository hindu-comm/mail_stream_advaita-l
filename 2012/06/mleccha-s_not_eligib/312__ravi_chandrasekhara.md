May be true but from what Jaldhar I think mentioned few years ago on this is list is that Shankaracharya in his bhashya stated Jabala was a Braahmana by birth. But in general, even Gurus (Not Rishis) may not have authority to convert one to a Shudra, Braahmana, etc. In addition, "who is the correct Guru" ? For example, Dayanand Saraswati of Arya Samaj would give Upanayana Samskara to anyone, but the traditional Sampradaya Acharayas (Shankaracharyas, Madhwa Mutts, Sri Vaishnava, etc) state it is contrary to Shastras and not correct.

Dear Raviji,

The guru can give the adhikara in the deserving cases. Satyakama is an example.

It is wonderful to hear, but per shastras he has no adhikara for Upanayna and sandhya-vandana. There is alternative Sandhya method for those who do not have adhikara. Dvijas who default on their duties on the other hand will hav eto answer/pay for it later.

PraNAms

I just saw Shivashankar/Lundgren mail. I have a fond memories of meeting him in person in Stockholm and almost had daily extensive discussions
 on Advaita Vedanta. He organized my talk at the local Hindu temple and we had after scrumptious South Indian dinner. 

He is more a Hindu than many Hindus I have met and more a Brahmin than many I know.

Hari Om!
