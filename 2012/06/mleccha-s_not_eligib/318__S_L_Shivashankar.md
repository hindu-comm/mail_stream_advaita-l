Dear Bhaskarji
Pranams,

Good to hear from you again! Thank you for your kind words.

I think you have made a very good point here. All the special cases I know
of (including myself, I dare to say) are due to sadhana/spritual reasons
alone, namely "to the sincere adhyAtama student/sAdhaka who wants to do his
sAdhana in veda mArga", as you beautifully puts it. The guru have
considered the Westerner suitable for such a sadhana. However, I don´t know
of any case when a Westerner has been given upanayanam just in order "to
lead a normal (loukika) life of a Hindu brAhmaNa." Probably Arya Samaj
would agree to perform upanyanam also for the reason of just living a
normal brahmana life, but that´s another story.

Warmest regards
Shivashankar
