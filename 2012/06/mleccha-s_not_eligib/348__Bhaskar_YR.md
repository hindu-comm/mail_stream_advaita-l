Again, IMHO, the above shloka does not talk about the vedAdhyayana in 
particular.  If it is shishyA-s general  approach to non-brAhmin guru for 
vedAdhyayana, the particular word 'ApatkAle' not necessary.  Moreover, we 
cannot stretch the meaning of adhyayanaM to 'vedAdhyayanaM', when the 
formalities and adhikAra for the vedAdhyayana are  so clear in our smruti 
texts.  Anyway, it is my opinion.  You are welcome to correct me prabhuji.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
