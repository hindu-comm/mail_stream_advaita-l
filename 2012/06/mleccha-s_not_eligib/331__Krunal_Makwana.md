However for the last few months the tone and replies of many members is baffling and rude to the point of common courtesy being non-existent, but my respect to the moderators for tolerating such behaviour and allowing looping arguments to continue in the wish for a positive out put (though the wish is left in vain :-) ).

Bhagavan Ramana Maharishi knew squat about shastra but wasn't he realised didn't he not know the science of advaita? Does the authenticity of being pure have to be stamped by your pure self before we accept them as authoritive.

If so your fundamental belief system in advaita is rocked to the core as the very person you rest on is flawed. Even Adi Shankara wasn't stupid to follow the scriptures and law blindly. He used his intelligence and heart to make decisions, though he venerated and followed the vedic texts diligently he was not afraid to divert where he thought necessary and we should learn from that too.

You are now questioning the actions of an AcArya, what qualifications do you hold to question and disrespect the actions of a present AcArya who himself is the embodiment of Adi saMkara, who I mentioned earlier violated rules in his time.

We have to move with the times using out heart and mind without the need of disrespecting someone elses belief system.
