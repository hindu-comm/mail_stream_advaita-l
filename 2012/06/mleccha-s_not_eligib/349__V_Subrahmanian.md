This verse is quoted by Anandagiri in the Br.Up.2.1.15 (ajAtashatru
brAhmaNam) where the brAhmaNa bAlaakI seeks BrahmavidyA from ajAtashatru, a
King (kshatriya).  Shankara says: // this is pratiloma here a braahmaNa
being a uttamavarNa and aught to be Acharya, approaching a kShatriya who is
not supposed to be an AchArya and hence this is prohibited.  Therefore you
be Acharya alone but I shall certainly impart you that knowledge. // For
this Anandagiri quotes the above verse.  The Editor in the footnote says:
Anandagiri has said (elsewhere) that the lower varNa one has to get the
vidya from a  higher varNa  one by namaskara and service (upasadana) etc.
But when the higher varNa has to get vidya from a lower varna acharya, then
just shraddhA is enough (no namaskara, service, etc.) is the AchAra.
