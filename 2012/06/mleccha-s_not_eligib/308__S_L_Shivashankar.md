I can speak from years of personal experience here: I have myself undergone
upanayanam many years ago, and I have never on any occasion encountered any
traditional pandit or acharya who has said this was a mistake. On the
contrary, they have been very happy finding out that a westerner (i am from
Sweden) have undergone upanayanam, and they have encouraged me and
instructed me to strictly perform my sandhyavandanam, performing pujas and
study traditional vedic chanting. Moreover, I have several western friends
with similar experiences from traditional acharyas, pandits and mathas.

Warmest regards
S. L. Shivashankar
