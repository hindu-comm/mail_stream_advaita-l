Dear Raviji,

The guru can give the adhikara in the deserving cases. Satyakama is an example.

Regards,
Sunil KB

It is wonderful to hear, but per shastras he has no adhikara for Upanayna and sandhya-vandana. There is alternative Sandhya method for those who do not have adhikara. Dvijas who default on their duties on the other hand will hav eto answer/pay for it later.

PraNAms

I just saw Shivashankar/Lundgren mail. I have a fond memories of meeting him in person in Stockholm and almost had daily extensive discussions on Advaita Vedanta. He organized my talk at the local Hindu temple and we had after scrumptious South Indian dinner. 

He is more a Hindu than many Hindus I have met and more a Brahmin than many I know.

Hari Om!
