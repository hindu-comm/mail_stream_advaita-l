Namaste,
Mahabharata which is considered as the fifth Veda, in the section
describing who is  a Brahmana declares that Brahmanahood is by conduct
alone. Bhagavan has his Kataksha on people who lead a righteous life.
An example of this is Vidura whose house Lord Krishna visited inspite
of invitation from Duryodhana.
As mentioned by Jaldhar ji, we have to become conservative
evolutionist, which I understand is meant to support positive changes
in Hinduism.
Ramana Maharshi who considered Lord Arunachala as his Guru,  declared
himself as a Atyashrami. The concept of Atyashrami is explained in the
Suta Samhita clearly.
When HH Sri Bharathi Theertha Swamiji conferred the Sri Adi
Shankaracharya award to Swami Dayanandi Saraswathiji, said that both
Sri Swamiji and Dayananda Ji were Sama Manaskar, it means they concur
mentally. Jocularly he mentioned that they were not Sama Vayaskar
since Dayanandaji was 20 years older to him.

Hari Om Tat Sat,
Sriram
