Person is not S L Shivashankar. He is anyone who wants to convert hindu. It
was declared already.
As you already converted, you are not being talked here. Because my
questions are for a person who has not yet converted and wants to know
everything about conversion and it's validity, etc.

Faith on a person. OK.
But, how to check that he knows enough about shAstra-s and is pure enough
to stand steadfast in truth ?
Just one way, study yourself and check.

OK. The making of exception is based on wish of those person. We don't
consider this base enough.

My definition is not based on faith on a person. Knowing enough shAstra-s,
including mImAMsA is the standard with qualities like truthfulness, lack of
greed, etc.
According to sha~Nkara and others the injunctions of shAstra-s are left
away and opposed views are followed only when one is tainted with kAma,
which expresses itself in many ways.

dayAnanda = AryasamAja's establisher.
But, including AVG's dayAnanda is also not barred.
He is also doing something like reformation of vaidika-s.

I know. Some prize from some organization can't prove someone valid for all
his moves. Award was specific for specific work.

It is now a custom to ignore violations of shAstra-s by insiders of
hinduism, because in a way or other they are helping hindu community,
either by teaching world about us or by bringing money, etc.
Checking violators is now a dangerous thing and in many ways impractical.
It needs enough courage too.

AVG is not an authority on dharmashAstra-s. It's moves reflect it's own
rules and observations which are not necessarily based on scriptures.

That liberal attitude makes him outsider for vaidika-s.

This is what we appreciate, spreading good things. Nothing more.

He may be contacted for clarification.
Unlike others, we don't believe a person because he is chief of an
organization. We didn't hesitate to refute buddha, so will we oppose
everything which is not valid according to shAstra-s.

Anyway, I don't want to hurt your feelings. Please keep going with respect
for whatever you are doing. Take everything I said as impractical and
academic.
