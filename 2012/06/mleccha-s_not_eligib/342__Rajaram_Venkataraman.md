Varna dharma is like genetics, highly mathematical. I don't know how to
upload to the site but anyone can work it out. Manu gives 7 generation rule
for anuloma and pratiloma marriages. You can calculate and see why. Let us
say Parent 1 has a proportion of sattva (60), rajas (30) and tamas (10) and
 Parent 2 has a different proportion of sattva (10), rajas (40) and tamas
(50), the offspring will have sattva (35), rajas (35) and tamas (30). This
is a new jati and if he marries in to one of his parent's jati member - say
Parent 1  - his offspring will have sattva (47.5), rajas (32.5) and tamas
(40). If his offspring continues to marry in to Parent 1's jati for seven
gnerations, his proportion at the end of the seventh generation will be
sattva (60), rajas (30) and tamas (10)! This works for any starting
proportion.

I think knowing one's varna will help everyone though there I no becoming
Hindu as every one is. Helping with the site is no problem but I want to be
sure my self that I am not violating sastras explicitly.
