So are you going to preach not to learn shAstra-s to have advaita-GYAna ?
Again, what is opposed is conversion and deciding varNa on base of wish.
Nothing more.

Purity is not the single thing which I asked  for. It is enough knowledge
of scriptures.
How could a person who doesn't know about a system through scriptures can
decide anything for people's varNa, etc. ?

So, do you expect all saMnyAsin-s to follow that ? sha~Nkara is no greater
than veda-s and dharma-shAstra-s. What he did was his decision. If his
followers can support that, let them do so according to shAstra-s. If they
can't, why do you expect from me to accept that as a general rule ?

Read again my posts. I'm not believer of a person, including sha~Nkara. I'm
faithful to scriptures and it's explanations which are without errors.

Here we differ. We hold that he took decisions according to shAstra-s.
Whatever was not in accordance with shAstra-s is not respected by me. So
say our AchArya-s :

यान्यनवद्यानि कर्माणि । तानि सेवितव्यानि । नो इतराणि । यान्यस्माकं
सुचरितानि । तानि त्वयोपास्यानि ।। नो इतराणि ।

Revealing reality is quite painful for many. But, closing eyes is not a
remedy.

Leave talks about my qualifications. Just try to test validity of my
statements.
Because if I start asking for the same in reply, talk will never be able to
run.

Actually, I didn't invite him to get hurt. I was not talking about specific
person. But, he took my words for himself.

 Though I agree Vedic dharma fundamentally has to be intact including that

Get out of your confusion. You say intact and then suggest improvements !!
What is this ?
Either accept as it is or leave the whole ? There is no half egg- half hen.
