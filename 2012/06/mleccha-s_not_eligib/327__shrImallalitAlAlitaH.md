Whatever you say is about certain people and their qualities. We are
talking irrespective of people and their inclinations. We are talking about
rules with firm bases.
Everyone is free to do according to wish. We can't stop them. And
definitely we are not writing for that purpose. We are just checking that
whether the person converting hindu is doing that according to shAstra-s or
not. If not why is he doing that ? Will he be benefited by doing karma and
upAsanA according to shAstra-s ? Has he faith in shAstras or not ? If yes,
why isn't he accepting that conversion is not applicable ? If he has no
faith in shAstra-s, then why is he converting to hindu ? And why is he
following rules laid by a less-knowing person ? Was the person who made or
suggested a new system able to view alaukika-things ? If not, why he did
that ? etc.
These questions go against every samAja-sudhAraka, including vivekAnanda,
dayAnanda, chinmayAnanda, etc.
So, better accept that they are forming a new stream which is not so much
based on shAstra-s. They follow shAstra-s as long as they wish and part of
rules and system laid by them is based on free will.
Then just leave the talk after knowing differences. That's it.
