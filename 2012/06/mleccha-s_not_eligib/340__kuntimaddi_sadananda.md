Sriram - PraNams

We are trying to develop a website www.becomeahindu where one who wants to become a Hindu has to study some information provided and take a on-line exam and become eligible to become a Hindu. There will be instuctions to do homam at the nearest Hindu Temple and do nama karaNam as per Hindu Tradition, if one wants. An appropriate certificate is rovided once. This is also - to convert to so called HinduWs to become Hindus - exposure to minimum understanding of the tenents of Hinduism along with the respect for our scriptures, The Vedas. 

What varna should he belong - we leave it to him to decided based on GuNa and/or Karma.

If anyone interested in helping in the development of the website, he can contact me privately.

Hari Om!
Sadanana
