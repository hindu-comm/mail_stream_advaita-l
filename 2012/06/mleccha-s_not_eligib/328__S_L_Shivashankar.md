I don´t know if "the person" is referring to me specifically. In any case,
I would like to comment upon what you have written.

Apparently my guru thinks so, obviously holding a different view from
yours.

Quite obviously there are many people from very traditional backgrounds who
differs from your view, and who are willing to make an exception and adopt
into the hindu fold, giving upanayanam etc. people like me. This is not the
"standard procedure" or the common way to do it, that´s for sure, but such
adoptions are done as an "exception from the rule". I now of several such
cases. I´m not the only one.

I can assure you he´s not a "less-knowing person", unless your definition
of such a person is someone who happens to disagree with your own
interpretations :-)

I´m not a disciple of Swami Dayananda, Swami Chinmayananda or any of their
disciples, although I respect them very much and have read several of their
books.  Talking about Swami Dayananda, did you know that he recently got
the Adi Shankara Award from Sringeri Jagadguru HH Bharati Tirtha Swamigal?
Do you think that Dayananda would have got such an award if the Jagadguru
and the Sringeri Matha thought that Dayananda and his disciples where
heavily violating dharma? Please keep in mind that at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam
there are many Westerners, and upanayanam is given also to some Western
students, for instance the brilliant scholar Dr Michael Comans
(Vasudevacharya), author of several books on vedanta. It is a well-known
fact that Swami Dayananda has a very "liberal" attitude on caste-issues,
and there´s no chance that the Sringeri Jagadguru and the Matha doesn´t
know about this. The spreading of vedanta, veda and hindu values among
people also outside the traditional brahmana group is one of the hallmarks
of Swami Dayananda and Arsha Vidya Gurukulam. Nevertheless, he is given the
Adi Shankara Award. Does this mean that the Sringeri Jagadguru is a
"less-knowing person" according to you, or does it mean that the Jagadguru
does not consider Swami Dayananda a violator of hindu dharma?

Warmest regards
Shivashankar
