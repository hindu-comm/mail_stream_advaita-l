You have correctly pointed this. That's why, because of this specific
limitation of people, I said that you must follow whatever you are doing
with faith and respect.
While doing this, I also advised to study more to know more to be clear in
future interactions.

That depends on study of scriptures and truthfulness of aspirant. Sticking
to scriptures in maximum extent is advisable to know these things.
On personal level, it all depends on you and your studies, etc.
You have right to put your view while giving chance to traditionals at the
same time. Then start thinking.

Actually, vaidika-s, i.e. sanAtanI-s, hold that birth determines jAti. And
those who have specific jAti are allowed to get upanayana, gAyatrI and veda
at specific time. So, I don't see anything for outsiders in traditional
view.
In view of reformists, who are mixing their wish, karma determines it. And
in that way you are allowed to take these. These are non-traditionals.
So, traditionals have no difference on these issues.

Who to decide who´s

You.
Because it's you life and you will be affected by it.
And we traditionalist decide it for you and us to save you and us from
going away from scriptures.

This is not enough. Proper study is needed very much.

It means many things.
First, they are not approving every thing of dayAnanda. So, they are not
erring.
Secondly, they are not keeping away from such people. So, they are
supporting wrong people in a way.
Both way it goes.


Once my friend told me that merely refraining from doing bad is not enough.
You must keep away from bad people too. Otherwise, you are supporting bad
people and hence deceiving those who are observing you to follow. Great
People have bigger responsibility.
