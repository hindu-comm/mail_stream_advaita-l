I recently heard this from a Kannada smArta family:  They have a son who
works in a small hotel as a cashier and finding a match for him was a great
difficulty.  They told me that many smarta/madhwa families have started
taking brides from a Lingayat sub-sect called 'panchama sAli'.  It is
learned that this sect is authorised to perform puja (archaka) in
Shiva/Devi Temples.  When my friend's family went to a house of this
community to see a prospective bride, they informed them that the elder
sister of this girl is married into a Madhwa family in Bangalore who gave
them (the bride's family) a decent sum of money apart from spending money
for the marriage themselves.  I heard that this practice of (arranged)
inter-marriage  between brahmins and panchama sAli-s is now becoming
popular.

So, smarta/madhwa families are getting 'cosmopoliton'.  I mentioned this
not as  a non-advaitic topic but since the discussion on conversion, etc.
is initiated now.  Many say those  brahmana men in the purohita profession
also face this difficulty and this solution is becoming popular.
