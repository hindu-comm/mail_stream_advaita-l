Dears
IMHO it is a matter of faith that Vedas are apoureshya.Logically we can not establish this as the evidence is only subjective.Ofcourse Science has its drawbacks but it is transparent.Anyone can test the laws and the results will be identical except on a few occasions and these can be fixed/explained.
So what Sri Shyam has said is acceptable.Vedas realm is different and Science`s` field is different.R.Krishnamoorthy.
