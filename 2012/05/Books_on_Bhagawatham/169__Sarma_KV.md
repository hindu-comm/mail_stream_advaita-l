Dear Sri Sunil,

Please refer to Valmiki Ramayana Ayodhya Kanda sarga 39, SlOka-s 15 to 17.

vaasaamsi cha mahaarhaaNi bhuushaNaani varaaNi cha |
varSaaNyEtaani samkhyaaya vaidehyaaH kshipramaanaya ||

narEndrENa evamuktastu gatvaa koshaagRiham tataH |
praayacchat sarvam aahRitya seetaayai kshipramEva tat ||

saa sujaataa sujaataani vaidehee prasthitaa vanam |
bhooshayaamaasa gaatraaNi tairvicitrairvibhooshaaNaiH ||

In these SlOka-s, It is said DaSaratha ordered for ornaments to be brought
for Sita. Sita wore them and set out for the forests.

Also, refer to Aranya Kanda the sarga-s where Ravana comes to kidnap Sita.
He talks lecherously and describes the ornaments she was wearing at time.
If you are not satisfied with the above reference I can fetch you the
kidnap episode SlOka-s also.
