There are some verses in Bhagawatham which match some of the Gaudapada karikas.Gaudapada being the disciple of Shuka Maharshi must have got his Upadesha fom him:To cite a few,
"Adavante ca yan nasti vartamanepi tatthtatha!
Vitataih sadrshah santah avithatha iti lakshitah!!"
That which doesnot exist in the beginning and in the end,
doesnot verily exist in the middle.being differing in their
variety,they are verily considered as non-differing."

Na nirodhah,na ca utpattih,na baddho na ca sadhakah!
Na mumukshuh na vai mauktah ityesha Paramartatha!!.
"There is no dissolution,no creation,none in bondage,nor an aspirant
none aspiring for liberation,none verily liberated,these are the Supreme truth."

Sadhashiva Brahmendra has written "GuruKavya"where he has said Gauapada,the disciple of Shuka,defeated the Buddhists headed by the leader of the Nishaka clan.
Moreover,many stanzas have been added to the original Bhagawatham over the years by many poets.
N.Srikanta.
