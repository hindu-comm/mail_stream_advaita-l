The concerned portion is detailed in the Brahma sutra bhashya and the 
answer by Shankara is contained in the bhashya.It is said Vyasa and 
Shankara differed on this point.But,the scholars have not explained on 
what points the two differed on this question.

Infact vyAsa puts hundred different types of objections to this bhAshya 
and shankara, in turn, countered these objections with thousand 
explanations, so says mAdhaveeya.  If this sUtra / bhAshya is so important 
and subject for debate between vyAsa & shankara,    I wish atleast 
bhagavatpAda could have included an addendum to this sUtra bhAshya by 
mentioning his debate with vyAsa maharshi :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
