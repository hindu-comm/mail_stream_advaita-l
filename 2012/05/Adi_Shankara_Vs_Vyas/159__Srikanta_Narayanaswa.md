Pranams.
The relevant debate by Vyasa and shankara is on the Brahma sutra:
"Tadanantara Pratipattau ramhati samparikshvaktah prasna nirupanabhyam".

The question is on the release of the Jiva during his time of death.The purvapaksha is whether the jiva escapes from the body along with his prana and tanmatras like a bird flies from the tree on which it has perched?Or,whether it flies without these entities?
The answer is the jiva at the time of his death which is released escapes along with theseentities.(ramhati samparidkshvaktah).

The concerned portion is detailed in the Brahma sutra bhashya and the answer by Shankara is contained in the bhashya.It is said Vyasa and Shankara differed on this point.But,the scholars have not explained on what points the two differed on this question.
N.Srikanta.
