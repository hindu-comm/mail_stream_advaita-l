Manana and chintana is always necessary no matter how easy the text and 
for that reasons commentaries exist.

As for the text itself, by and large the language of the puranas and 
itihasa is pretty simple for one who knows Sanskrit.  This genre avoids 
the rhetorical and stylistic gymnastics of e.g. the mahakavyas.  The 
Bhagavata is somewhat of an anomaly because it contains a few words not 
found anywhere else.  (Some historians suspect they are loan words from 
some Dravidian language.)  But even those are rare and any enterprising 
layman who wishes to try and has a dictionary and basic grasp of vyakarana 
should be able to follow 99% without any problems.  In fact when people 
ask me for advice about learning Sanskrit I advise them to try and 
translate from these works rather than say Kalidas.
