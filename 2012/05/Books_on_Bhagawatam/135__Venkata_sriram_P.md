Namaste,

Swami Tattvavidananda Saraswati of Arsha Vidya Trust is translating entire 
bhAgavataM into Telugu. He is refering sridhara's commentary only. TTD has
taken up the task of publishing them. 

However, there is one ancient commentary in telugu by a great telugu scholar
by name Brahmasri Mulpuru Subramanya Sastry. He is a disciple of *ananthAvaraM
swamiji* (as usually called) who was paramahamsa sanyasi hailed from Ananthavaram,
a village near Krishna District, AP. There also a popular island here called *haMsala deevi* and a famous Krishna Temple is to be seen here called *venu gopala swamy*. 
So, you can enquire with your elders about this book. Generally, elderly people hailing
from neighbouring beltlike Tenali, Ananthavaram happen to know this scholar. 

As regards the commentary by Shri Dongreji, i am not aware of any of his writings.
There is another Dongreji by name Shri Vireshwara Krishna Dongre Ji who was a pu. mimAmsa scholar and AFAIK he was a mimAmsaka and never tried his hands on
puranas. 

regs,
sriram
