//
let me ask the inconvenient question

//

The statements like the one above demonstrates height of perversion.

How can one expect a mahAsAdhvi like Mother Sita like that who conversed with
rAvaNa by placing a darbhA grass between them because rAvaNa was para-puruSa.

Are you not aware of the incident of rAvaNa kidnapping Mother Sita and lifting Her
with his arms and carrying on his shoulder. She almost fainted that time. During 
this moment only, Mother Sita touched rAvaNa and that too when she was unconscious.

Mother Sita was referring to the above incident of kidnapping. 

Even to think of Mother Sita in such a way is a sin and one has to perform prAyaschitta !
