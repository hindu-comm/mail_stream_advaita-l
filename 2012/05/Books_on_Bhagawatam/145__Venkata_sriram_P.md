Jaladharji,

///

In fact when people ask me for advice about learning Sanskrit I advise them to try and 
translate from these works rather than say Kalidas.

//

Our elders and even my acharya used to say that one can pickup basics of sanskrit
by reading vAlmiki's rAmAyaNa. 

My own brother is a testimony to this. He only completed pArAyaNa of sundarakANDa alongwith pratipadArtha. Now, he is much comfortable in speaking & writing sanskrit without any inhibitions.

regs,
sriram
