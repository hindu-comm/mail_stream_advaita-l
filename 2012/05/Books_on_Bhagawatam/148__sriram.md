Dear Sri Rajaram
I have read Sundara Kandam and Ayodhya Kandam only.I have not read the 
Yuddha Kandam as they are not for household parayanam.However if the meaning 
you got  by a superficial understanding of the stanza quoted by you then 
hats off to you.May be I am wrong in making a sweeping conclusion that 
Valmiki Ramayanam does not require a Bhashya Kartha and  that it is easy to 
understand.
R.Krishnamoorthy.

It is easy to understand only when we understand superficially, which is 
tantamount to not understanding. As I mentioned in my other mail on Srimad 
Bhagavatham, is the moon farther from earth than the sun? That is what the 
text says. Of course not, but explain how.

Regarding Valmiki Ramayana being easy, let me ask the inconvenient question: 
Did Ravana forcefully have sex with Sita? In yuddha khanda, 116 .9 Sita 
says, "My heart, which was subservient to you, was abiding in you. What 
could I do, helpless as I was, with regard to my limbs which had fallen 
under the sway of another?"

He did not and could not even see her properly but explain how.

Jaladharji,

///

In fact when people ask me for advice about learning Sanskrit I advise them
to try and
translate from these works rather than say Kalidas.

//

Our elders and even my acharya used to say that one can pickup basics of
sanskrit
by reading vAlmiki's rAmAyaNa.

My own brother is a testimony to this. He only completed pArAyaNa of
sundarakANDa alongwith pratipadArtha. Now, he is much comfortable in
speaking & writing sanskrit without any inhibitions.

regs,
sriram
