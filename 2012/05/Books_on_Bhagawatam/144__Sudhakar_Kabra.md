Unfortunately it seems that even the sanskrit editions of this tika are long out of print. The Tirupati Devasthana is in the process of publishing an edition of the Bhagavata purana with the bhavartha dipika along with other vishistadvaita, dvaita etc. tikas but it will be some time before it is complete and in any case it will be Sanskrit only.

I was going to reply to you that as far as I knew Dongre Maharaj's bhagavata expositions were only available in Gujarati but then I came across this:

I have not seen the book so I don't know if it is a translation or an original work (Dongre Maharaj knew English, Marathi, and Hindi as well as Gujarati and Sanskrit.) nor can I vouch for its quality.

No this Dongre Maharaj (Ramachandra Shastri Dongre) was different. He was born in Vadodara (Baroda) Gujarat of Chitpavana Brahmana stock. (The Gaekwad Maharajas were Marathas so there is a sizable Marathi population there.)He became one of the most popular and beloved Bhagavata Kathakars of the 20th century in Gujarat and his writings are widely available wherever Gujarati speakers can be found. He reached Vaikuntha in 1990.
