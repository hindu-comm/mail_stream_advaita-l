Namaste

Reading your messages I have some doubts. According to Advaita Vedanta
of Adi Sankara -

Sankhya = Vedanta

OR

Sankhya = Sravana + Manana + Nididhyasana

What is correct?

Yoga = Sravana + Manana + Nididhyasana

OR

Yoga = Sravana + Manana + Nididhyasana + Yogic Practice like Asana,
Pranayama, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi

Which is correct?
