Dear
Yoga is about disciplining the mind.To achieve this there are many methods 
of which asanas,pranayamam-breath control-dhyana practices are 
recommended.Discipline of the mind is very difficult to achieve.Abhyasam and 
Vairagyam are the corner stones for this.These two are obtainable by the 
other methods like asanas,dhyanam,pranayamam etc.This is my 
understanding..RKrishnamoorthy
