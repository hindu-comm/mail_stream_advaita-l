Namaste Sri Vidyasankara

Sri V Subrahmanian said -

18.13: sAnkhye = VedAnte.  //which have been spoken of; sankhye, in Vedanta
- sankhya is that scripture where the subject-matters In the sentence,
'Thou art That', the word Thou means the individual Self, and That means
Brahman. The comprehension of their unity, and also 'hearing, reflection
and meditation' are referred to as the subject-matters. to be known are
fully (samyak) stated (khyayante)-; krtante, in which actions terminate.
KrtAnte qualifies that very word (Vedanta).//

This shows that according to Shankara the term 'sAnkhya' is completely
Vedantic.

You are here saying Sankhya is same as Jnana friom Sravana of Vedanta
Vakyas. Yoga is Dhyana of Manana and Nididhyasana.

When Gita is saying Sankya and Yoga it is not always the Sankhya and
Yoga Darshanas but may be different.

It is appearing Sankhya and Yoga are used in with many meanings. It is
good to give a list of all meanings for Sankhya and Yoga.
