Yes, there are multiple meanings in which these terms are used. However,
merely listing the possible meanings is not going to be of any use. What is
more important is to understand the context in which a particular meaning
applies. When someone posts with specific quotations and translations from
one of the texts, what they are providing is that context.

If you pay close attention to the details, these questions will not arise.
