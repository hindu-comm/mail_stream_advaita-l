Namaste,

To my knowledge there is no mention as to whether Adi Sankara practised any Yogic exercises but there is mention that he was adept in Vajroli Mudra, probably the most advanced Yogic Kriya. That convinces me that he (Adi sankaracharya) was also adept in the Asanas and the Mudras.

Regards,
Sunil KB

But what are the simple Asanas and Pranayamas? Is only Padmasana
enough? What is the list of simple Asanas we can practice?

What Asanas and Pranayamas are the Sringeri Swamijis practicing?

There is no information. That is why I am asking. In Nitya Karma it is
clearly said we have to do Sandhyavandana, Deva Puja and others. Like
this there is no clear Asanas from Yoga for Advaita Sadhana.
