But what are the simple Asanas and Pranayamas? Is only Padmasana
enough? What is the list of simple Asanas we can practice?

What Asanas and Pranayamas are the Sringeri Swamijis practicing?

There is no information. That is why I am asking. In Nitya Karma it is
clearly said we have to do Sandhyavandana, Deva Puja and others. Like
this there is no clear Asanas from Yoga for Advaita Sadhana.
