Because nityakarmA is not something that needs to be tailored to each person,
whereas a yogAsana and prANAyAma regimen that promotes the inward focus
of one's citta is something that needs to be tailored to each person, under the
guidance of a guru.

To begin with, padmAsana and the prANAyAma as practised during sandhyA-
vandana is enough, but if you don't find the quality of ekAgratA increasing with
that practice, then you need to learn what works for you, under a combination
of your own initiative and good guidance. 

And as I mentioned before, it is more important not to neglect yama and niyama.
Almost everyone jumps to the physical aspect of Asana and prANAyAma, but 
the strength of one's mental make-up from observing yama and niyama is a
very great prerequisite for vedAnta vicAra.
