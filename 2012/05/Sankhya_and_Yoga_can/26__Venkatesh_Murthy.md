Namaste

If Yoga is necessary for Advaita Sadhana next questions -

A Do we have to do Asanas like inverted poses like Sarvangasana and
Pranayama OR simple Asanas and simple alternate nostril breathing will
do? Yoga people say the Inverted Poses will increase blood flow to
brain and help to increase intelligence.

B Some Yoga teachers like Baba Ramdev are teaching breathing exercises
like Kapala Bhati and Anuloma Viloma Pranayama. These are necessary
for Advaita?

C What is the list of Asanas and breathing exercises for Advaita Marga?
