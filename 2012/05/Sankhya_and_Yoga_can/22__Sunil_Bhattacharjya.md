Svetasvatara upanishad (4.10) says that Prakriti is Maya, thus confirming that "Prakriti of Sankhya is Maya of Vedanta. Svetasvatara says that the Mayin (the Lord of Maya) is the Maheshvara (or the Ishvara,whom Sankhya calls Asiddha or indefinable) This means the Lord of Parakriti or Maya is Maheshvara or the Brahman, who is anirvachaniya. Adi Sankaracharya had written a bhashya on it and it is pity that the people who respect Adi Sankara ignores his bhashya on the Sveatsvatara Upanishad. I think it is desirable for a Vedantin to read the Svetasvatar upanishad for proper understanding of the Sankhya as well as of the concept of Maya. The Svetasvatara Upanishad, which can probably be called the Sankhya upanishad.To my knowledge Ramanujacharya and Madhvacharya avoided the Svetasvatara upanishad.

Yes, there are multiple meanings in which these terms are used. However,
merely listing the possible meanings is not going to be of any use. What is
more important is to understand the context in which a particular meaning
applies. When someone posts with specific quotations and translations from
one of the texts, what they are providing is that context.

If you pay close attention to the details, these questions will not arise.
