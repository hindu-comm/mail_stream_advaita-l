Namaste,

To my knowledge the eyes should best be "ardha-nimilita" only.

Namaste

You are correct to say we can do Dhyana with open eyes. But I learned
in Pranayama eyes have to be closed. The mind will not run here and
there in Pranayama because breath control will not allow mind to
behave like that. This is the secret of Pranayama. Because the mind is
automatically controlled we can focus inside easily not outside. We
are asked to do Pranayama with closed eyes.

Kindly see the video. They close the eyes during all Pranayamas -

'Pranayama, the formal practice of controlling the breath, lies at the
heart of yoga. It has a mysterious power to soothe and revitalize a
tired body, a flagging spirit, or a wild mind. The ancient sages
taught that prana, the vital force circulating through us, can be
cultivated and channeled through a panoply of breathing exercises. In
the process, the mind is calmed, rejuvenated, and uplifted. Pranayama
serves as an important bridge between the outward, active practices of
yoga--like asana--and the internal, surrendering practices that lead
us into deeper states of meditation.'

'While practicing asana, students are advised when to inhale and
exhale, but no additional manipulation of the breath is introduced.
Within the pranayama portion of the class—which may comprise 15
minutes of a 90-minute session—students sit in a comfortable
cross-legged posture with their eyes closed.'

The dazzling light is called *bhargas* shines in 5 different colours at a distance of 4 inches, 6 inches, 8 inches, 10 inches & 12 inches from the tip of the nose. The colours represent the 5 colours of pancha tanmAtrAs. It is to be noted that for bahirlakSya sAdhana,the eyes should be open.
