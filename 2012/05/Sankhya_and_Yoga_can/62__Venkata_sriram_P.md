Namaste,

//
Normally when we do Japa or Dhyana of something we have to close our eyes
//

What is the use of closing the eyes when minds runs here and there. 

First the meditation should be done with eyes open only. One has to
visualize one's iSTa dEvata with eyes open. Gradually with practice,
one can visualize the form mentally with eyes closed. 

But whatever be the form, the sUkSma rUpa of dEvata is of the form of jyotis only.
And the ideal place of meditation of iSTa dEvata is one's hridaya because gradually
it leads to the dahara vidya upAsana.

So, the dhyAna of jyoti with eyes open is *bahir-lakSya* only. It should culminate in
*antar-lakSya* upAsana. With the practice, this jyoti gives the darsana in hridaya kamala.

So, trATaka is the first step to reach this state of jyOtirdarSaNa in hridaya puNDarika. 
However, there are several phases involved in this abhyAsa. One form of bahirlakSya of
jyotirvidya is nAsAgra-sthAna ie., tip of the nose. The dazzling light is called *bhargas* shines in 5 different colours at a distance of 4 inches, 6 inches, 8 inches, 10 inches & 12 inches from the tip of the nose. The colours represent the 5 colours of pancha tanmAtrAs. It is to be noted that for bahirlakSya sAdhana,the eyes should be open. 

>From here, the antar-lakSya starts with eyes closed. The same jyoti starts giving darshana in the hridaya akasa. From here, commences the dahara vidyA upAsana. 
The famous nArAyaNa sUkta says that *padmakOsa pratIkAshaM hridayaM chApi adhOmukhaM.....adhOniSTyA ....nAbhyAM upari tiSTati* *jwAlAmAlA kulaM bhAti*
*nIvAra sUkavattanvI ....aNUpamA* indicates this daharOpAsana only. 

Once, the dahara vidya is achieved, the advaita sAdhana commences. Because, he is 
firmly established in this upaniSad vidyA and visualizes the parama-jyoti in his hridayAkAsa. With the visualizes, he is able to meditate on the parama-jyOti.
When he is able to establish himself in the Innermost Light,he starts negatingthe anAtma vastu as *nEti nEti* and establishes himself in this hridaya AkAsa and merges himself with the Light of Lights.This is brahmAnubhUti. 

So, trATaka abhyAsa is just a beginning only. 

In the abhyAsa of jyOtirvidya, one goes to the extent of visualizing the entire universe
as a mass of dazzling light only. The dhyAna prior to rudrAbhiSEka is *ApAtALa-nabhasthalAnta bhuvana brahmANDaM Avisphurat *jyOtisphATika* lingamauli......
brahmANDa-dEha bhasita himaruchA........* This dhyAna denotes the above jyotir vidya
only where Siva is visualized in a form of huge mass of light. 

So, initially, the dhyAna should be done with eyes open for clear visualization which is
called *bahir-lakSya*. Later, antar-lakSya sAdhana is practiced. When siddhi is achieved, it doesn't matter whether eyes are closed or open. One visualizes 
this jyoti externally as well as internally as the shruti declares *antar-bahish cha tat sarvaM vyApta nArAyaNa sthitaH*. 

But, this jyOtir-vidya as expounded in maNDalabrAhmaNa, shANDilya, maitrAyaNi etc. is 
saguNa upAsna only. But, this vidya leads the sAdhaka gradually to Atma Vichara and
nirguNa abhyAsa.
