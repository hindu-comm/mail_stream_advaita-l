Namaste,

/////

Do we have to do Asanas like inverted poses like Sarvangasana and
Pranayama OR simple Asanas and simple alternate nostril breathing will
do? Yoga people say the Inverted Poses will increase blood flow to
brain and help to increase intelligence

A healthy body and healthy mind are required for dharma sAdhana (shariramadhyam khalu dharma sadhanam). 

In order to keep the body fit, one has to perform yOgAbhyAsa. Simple asanas, pranayamas & a couple of rounds of sUryAnamaskAra is required.

Shri Abhinava Vidya Tirtha used to perform yogic exercises everyday to keep himself fit. He was an expert swimmer also and used to swim across tunga river. Shri Bharati Tirtha Swamiji, even to this day inspite of his bulky body, performs yoga in early hours. 
Swami Sivananda Saraswati of Rishikesh performed yoga everyday. 

But that doesn't mean that you hang yourself upside down for 3hours and do haTayOga. 
These sort of practices are not required for Advaita sAdhana. 

All the spiritual excercises should be done in moderation (ati sarvatra varjayEt). Moderation in karmAnuSTAna (ofcourse nityakarma should not be skipped), moderation
in yoga abhyAsa (suryanamaskara, prANAyAma as a part of sandhyavandana), moderation in food intake (one should neither over-eat nor fast). Equipped with this, 
should indulge in vedanta shravaNa & manana. This should be the goal of vEdAnta abhyAsins.
