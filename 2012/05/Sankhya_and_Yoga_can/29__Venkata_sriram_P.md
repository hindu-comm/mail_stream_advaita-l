Namaste,

///

It is appearing Sankhya and Yoga are used in with many meanings. It is
good to give a list of all meanings for Sankhya and Yoga.

//

Shri Vidyaranya in Vedanta Panchadasi says:

avyAkuladhIyAM.....sAnkhyanAmA vichArassyAn....siddhidaH

yat sAnkhyaiH prApyatE sthAnaM tat yOgairapi gamyatE
EkaM sAnkhyaM cha yOgaM cha yaH pashyati sa pashyati

tat kAraNaM sAnkhyayOgAbhipannaM iti hi shrutiH
yastu shrutErviruddhassa AbhAsa sAnkhyayOgayOH

upAsanaM nAtipakvamiha yasya paratra saH
maraNE brahmalOkE vA tattvaM mijnAya muchyatE

>From the above verses, shri vidyAraNya only accepts that definition of sAnkhya & yOga
which conforms with shruti. 

sAnkhya is tattva-padArtha vichAraNa and yOga is upAsana 

So, the followers of sankara vedanta should accept the above meanings only.

regs,
sriram
