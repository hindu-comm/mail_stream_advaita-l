Namaste

///
Some Yoga teachers like Baba Ramdev are teaching breathing exercises
like Kapala Bhati and Anuloma Viloma Pranayama. These are necessary
for Advaita?
//

sAmUhika yOgAbhyAsa is like sAmUhika upanayana / vivAha karma :))

Shri BKS Iyengar once in an interview with Shri Vijay Malhotra blasted the new-age yoga gurus. 

//
What is the list of Asanas and breathing exercises for Advaita Marga?

//

In Advaita mArga, per se, shravaNa & manana are the ONLY exercises. The yOgAbhyAsa etc. is for *chitta nirOdha* only as the manO-chanchalatva & vikSEpAs are
pratibandhakAs in vEdAnta vichAra.

sriram
