Dear List members,



Once again I am in need of your help for a reference, which I have lost:
as far as I remember, I read some 50 years ago in one on the gItA-s that
shrii Krishna would have declared about himself "I am doubt".

In spite of all my endeavors, I could not trace the exact reference for this
statement. In the shriimadbhagavadgItA and in the anugItA, there occurs in
several instances expressions like na san.shaya, but I could not trace
anything like sa.nshayamasmi.

Could anyone of you help me in the matter?

dhanyavAdaH

vandanAni,

Guy
