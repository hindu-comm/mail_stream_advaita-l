Namaste,

Lord Krishna did not want to enforce everything on people as he had given the free will to the people to act. The Lord did not want to quash that (the free will of the people). At the end of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna did ask Arjuna as to what the latter decided to do. During the Mahabharata war also once he asked his charioteer Daruka to keep his chariot ready so that if need be (ie. if Arjuna fails) he would kill the Kauravas himself.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Dear Sri Werlings,

I do not think there is a direct statement to the effect "I am doubt," but only
an indirect one, beccause doubt is a function of the mind.

In gItA chapter 10, SrI kRshNa says, indriyANAM manaS cAsmi - among the
senses, I am mind. The standard bhAshya explanation of manas, which occurs
not only here, but also in numerous other places, is saMkalpa-vikalpa-Atmaka.
One of the meanings of the word vikalpa is doubt. I think this is the closest
reference one can find.

Cf. bRhadAraNyakopanishat, where kAma, saMkalpa, vicikitsA, etc are said to
be nothing but mind (etat sarvaM mana eva). The word vikalpa is not found
here, but the word vicikitsA does mean doubt.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
