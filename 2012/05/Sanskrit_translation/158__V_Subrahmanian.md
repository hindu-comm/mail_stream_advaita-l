I saw a reference to this topic of Sureshwara's identity and works in the
introduction to the Taittiriya Upanishad vartika published by the
University of Madras1984 edited by Dr.R.Balasubramanian.  It is on p.5 of
the book.  Names of Prof.M. Hiriyanna and S.Kuppuswami Sastry are mentioned
in the information on this topic.
