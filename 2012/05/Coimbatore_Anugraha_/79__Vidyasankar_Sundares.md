http://vijayayatra.sringeri.net has a lot of multimedia content that may be
interesting for list members. It is mostly in Tamil and Kannada languages.

As an aside, I request list members not to include personal information such 
as postal address and phone numbers in responses to the list, as archives
are public information.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
