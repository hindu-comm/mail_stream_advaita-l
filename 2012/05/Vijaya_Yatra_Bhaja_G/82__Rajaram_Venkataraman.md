In one of the lectures during the current Yatra, Sringeri Periyava talks
about how Adi Sankara taught through prasada traya bhashyams and prakarana
granthas. Starting from upadesa sahasri with thousand verses to eka sloki
with just one verse. And those who don't have interest in even prakarana
granthas, he taught Bhaja Govindam. At ISKCON, there is an injunction to
not read Sankara Bhashyam but here is a rendition of Bhaja Govindam by
devotees at Los Angeles. Jivan mukti is accepted by both schools with
different meanings.
