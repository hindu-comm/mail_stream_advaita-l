It is 'prasthAna trayam' which consists of the Brahma sutras, the
Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita along with the shAnkara Bhashyam. In a way
it is a prasAda.

Many hymnal works of Shankaracharya such as the RanganAthAShTakam, the
GovindAShTakam, JagannAthAShTakam, ViShNu ShaTpadI stotram are favorites of
SriVaishNavas.  I have heard Sri Velukkudi Krishnan Swami reciting with
reverence a part of the RanganAthAShTakam saying that it is a composition
of Shankara.
