Namaste,

Nothing wrong in chanting bhagavan nama. Unlike we people, bhagavan doesn't have the discrimination whether the bhakta is advaitin, v.advaitin or dvaitin. 

I have taught Dakshinamurty stotra of Sanakara Bhagavatpada and Hayagriva Stotra
of Vedanta Desika to my 7 years old son. My son'sintellect and mEdhA shakti has improved.Also hisretentive & memory powerhave improved a lot. 

regs,
sriram
