Many hymnal works of Shankaracharya such as the RanganAthAShTakam, the
> GovindAShTakam, JagannAthAShTakam, ViShNu ShaTpadI stotram are favorites of
> SriVaishNavas.  I have heard Sri Velukkudi Krishnan Swami reciting with
> reverence a part of the RanganAthAShTakam saying that it is a composition
> of Shankara.
