Namaste.

A nice Kannada translation of this work, 'AtmArpaNa stuti' of Sri Appayya
Dikshita, is authored by Vidwan Ganesha Bhatta HobaLi of Bangalore.  It is
priced at Rs.75.  For copies one may contact the publisher on Bangalore
phones: 080 2639 1054 and 9686529700.

The book contains the original verses in Kannada script, word-to-word
meaning, a free translation followed by detailed notes with annotations for
each verse.

It has a brief note on Appayya Dikshita's life/works and the family-tree
chart. A list of works of Dikshita is also added.
