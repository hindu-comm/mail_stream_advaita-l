Dear
As Hindus we believe in manybirths.Perhaps the first birth of yours may have 
been an upgraded birth from some other species which might have done some 
yogya karma to obtain a manushya janma.So it is anirvachaniya.Another point 
is we can not know what we were in the earlier birth.Srimad Bhagavad gita 
will be able to solve your queries.R.Krishnamoorthy.
