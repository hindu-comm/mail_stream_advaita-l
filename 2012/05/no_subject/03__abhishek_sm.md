Pranams,

When I was posed with this question this was the reply I gave on my
page. What I wanted to know was, whether my reply was in agreement
with our school of thought.

" The cycle is infinite. What has started may end but what hasn't
started need not. This too has a logic behind it- Your question is
"Due to which karma was "I" born the 1st time?", "What was the reason
for "my" 1st birth?".

Observe the one aspect in both questions- the use of "I" and "MY".
When you ask," What was the reason for my 1st birth?", you acknowledge
the fact that you existed before you were born as well. This is
observed when you say "MY birth". So it is confirmed that you existed
before your birth in an unborn form. This unborn form maybe anything.
It maybe something about which we have no idea at all. Nevertheless it
is evident that you existed. Existence is due to karma as we already
know. If so, it means that even in an unborn form you are still
susceptible to the laws of karma. Therefore, you manifest even in
unborn forms. This cycle is hence regressive and infinite. "


Regards,
Abhishek Madhyastha
