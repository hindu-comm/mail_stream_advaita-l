In Telugu there is a saying which reads something like this when 
translated "Much study, made him lose simple common sense" or "Too much 
study, made him lose his mind"

This seem to be the state of affairs now among those few left who are 
intent to continuing their traditions.

praNAms Sri Satish prabhuji
Hare Krishna

IMHO, your remark & sweeping statement on saMpradAya vida-s & vAdins is 
totally unwarranted.  As you know saMpradAya has its own vital role to 
play in guiding the sAdhaka-s sAdhana in a channelized systematic way. One 
should be proud that he belongs to sanAtana vaidika saMpradAya which has 
been graced by stalwarts of vedAnta prakriya.  Having said this, I do 
agree that there exist  some irrational & unreasoned parables which some 
people hold at high esteem in the name of saMpradAya.  But this would not 
anyway come in the way of tradition & its sanctity. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
