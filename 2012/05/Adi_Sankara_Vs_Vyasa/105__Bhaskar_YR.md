Some people are arguing like this - Why was there a big argument with
Vyasa by Sankara? Because Sankara's view of Brahma Sutra and Vyasa's
view were not coinciding. But he was not willing to become Sishya of
Vyasa and learn. Instead of doing that he argued with Vyasa. This is
showing Sankara Advaita is not agreeing with Brahma Sutra. Even the
author of Sankara Dig Vijaya Madhava Vidyaranya is accepting this
point.

This is another story quite unique to only mAdhaveeya & chidvilAseeya  SV 
:-))  vyAsAchaleeya & anandagiri's biographies donot mention this vAda & 
prativAda between shankara & vedavyAsa.  chidvilAseeya shankara vijaya 
goes to some more extent and says Acharya's shishyA-s (padmapAda etc.) 
tried to man handle vyAsa (was then an old man) for repeatedly objecting 
shankara's explanation to vedAnta sUtra :-)) .  And shankara too passed 
some derogatory remarks on this old man :-))  BTW, mAdhaveeya ultimately 
says, vyAsa has finally agreed ( of course after 100 objections by vyAsa & 
1000 clarification by AchArya on the first sUtra of the third adhyAya 
which vyAsa asked for the interpretation :-)) to shankara's interpretation 
and granted him extra 16 years to the alpAyushi shankara :-)) So, dvaitins 
cannot argue that shankara bhAshya is vyAsa sUtra viruddha  by holding 
this story :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
