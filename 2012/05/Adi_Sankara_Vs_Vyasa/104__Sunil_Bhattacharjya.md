Namaste,

Vedavyasa was testing the depth of knowledge of Sankara and Vyasa was satisfied with Sankara's replies. It was Padmapada, who recognized Vedavyasa during the discussions and disclosed that he was none other than Vedavyasa in disguise. If Madhvacharya indeed met Vedavyasa at a later date it could be that the latter gave him the knowledge of Dvaita only as Advaita could have been beyond the ability of Madhvacharya to understand. After all, as Ramakrishna Paramhamsa says, Advaita, Visishtadvaita and Dvaita are all valid but at different levels.


Regards,
Sunil KB

Subject: [Advaita-l] Adi Sankara Vs Vyasa Debate in Sankara Dig Vijaya

Namaste

Adi Sankara met and argued with Vyasa regarding Brahma Sutra. But in
Madhva history Madhvacharya met Vyasa became his disciple and learned
Brahma Sutra.

Some people are arguing like this - Why was there a big argument with
Vyasa by Sankara? Because Sankara's view of Brahma Sutra and Vyasa's
view were not coinciding. But he was not willing to become Sishya of
Vyasa and learn. Instead of doing that he argued with Vyasa. This is
showing Sankara Advaita is not agreeing with Brahma Sutra. Even the
author of Sankara Dig Vijaya Madhava Vidyaranya is accepting this
point. Madhvacharya learned the Brahma Sutra directly from Vyasa and
wrote his Bhashya.

How can we answer this argument?
