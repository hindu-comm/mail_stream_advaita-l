Namaste.

I tried clicking on the URL on the email I posted to the List and it
works.  I copied the URL from this post:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/advaitin/message/56669

The Diagram is a work of a member Shri Ram Mohan Anantha Pai who can be
contacted on email:
pairamblr at yahoo.com<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/advaitin/msearch?query=Ram+Mohan&/group/advaitin/msearch?query=Ram+Mohan&se=pairamblr@yahoo.com>

Although the Files Section of the Advaitin Group is accessible only for
members a URL must surely be accessible for others too.
