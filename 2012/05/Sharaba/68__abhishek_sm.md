Pranams to all list members ,

I believe that the shaiva puranas describe an avatara of Shiva
fighting and defeating Narsimha while the vaishnava puranas do not
account for this.
What is the view of Adi Shankara on this? Also to mention the fact
that in the Lakshmi Nrusimha Karavalamba stotram, Sankara says the
crown of Brahma, Indra and Rudra are at the foot of Narasimha. Does
this in any way mean that Sankara does not accept the Shaiva view?
