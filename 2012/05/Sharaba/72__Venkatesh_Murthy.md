Can you give examples of Adi Sankara saying something not having
substance? There are none. That is why he is Jagad Guru. He will not
make misleading and confusing statements like Buddha and Nastikas. In
Brahma Sutra Bhashya 2- 2-37-41 he has rejected the Pasupata views. In
Pasupata itself Saiva is included. If you study it you will agree with
him.
