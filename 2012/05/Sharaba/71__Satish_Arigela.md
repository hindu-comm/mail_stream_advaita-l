Adi shankara can say and do anything he wants...and it might or might not have substance.

Anyway the sharabha story appears in the shiva purANa and the linga and the skAnda purANa-s and not in some pAshupata texts.

As far as I know shankara says nothing about this story in any of his works, except for a small explanation of the name sharabha in his viShNu sahasranAma bhAShya. Correct me if I am wrong here.

The incident says nothing about nR^isiMha-sharabha relationship. 


According to the nArada purANa, sharabha is invoked for protection in the context of nR^siMha worship.

I have known shrI vaiShNava-s who were successful sharabha upAsaka-s, in person.

It is a common feature where other devata-s are mentioned as being subordinate when praising a certain devata.
One does not read too much into this.. because, you will some shiva stotra-s attributed to Shankara where viShNu might be mentioned as praising rudra.
For a vaiShNava pA~ncharAtrika there is no difference between rudra and nR^isiMha. For them rudra = nR^isiMha.

Namaste

The Saiva view is not acceptable to Advaita. Adi Sankara has rejected
Saiva Pasupata views.

In Sankara Digvijaya there is one incident. One Kapalika tried to
sacrifice Adi Sankara to Siva. But Padmapada prayed to Narasimha.
Narasimha came and killed the Kapalika and saved Adi Sankara.

This incident is showing we have to worship Narasimha but not Sarabha
tomorrow. Many Smarta Brahmins have Lakshmi Narasimha as Family god. I
have not heard people with Sarabha as Family god.
