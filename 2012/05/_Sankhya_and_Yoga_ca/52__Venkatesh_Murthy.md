Anybody on the street cannot become Adi Sankara. We are all bound by
Dharma. Anybody cannot do what he pleases. But a Jeevan Mukta is above
Dharma and Adharma. He has become the Supreme. There cannot be any
laws for him.

A Jeevan Mukta can do what he pleases. We don't have the right to
question his activities.

But if he engages in any activity we cannot question it. Because all
his Agami Karma has burned up. What he does will not have any effect
on him. Only Prarabdha Karma is functioning.

This I have answered before. Adi Sankara will not need Vajroli. If
some other Yogi but not Jeevan Mukta enters into another man's body
and enjoying women like that his Brahmacharya will be destroyed.
Because his Mind is also enjoying the acts with women. When he comes
back to his original body the Mind will have Memory of those acts.
This will make him Impure and his Kundalini Sakti will flow downwards.
For Brahmachari the Kundalini has to flow upwards. To make it to flow
upwards the Yogi has to do Vajroli. Vajroli will make the Kundalini
Sakti flow Upwards. Vajroli will stop Veerya Skhalana.

He can enjoy as much as he can if he is a Jeevan Mukta but not if he
is Yogi only. This is the difference between them.

There is some value in the Sankara Vijaya granthas also.
