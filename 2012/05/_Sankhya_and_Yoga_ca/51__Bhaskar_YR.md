I dont think this book is printed.  If my memory serves me right I heard 
that this is available in KumbhakONam shankara Mutt in manuscript form. 
Anyway, this one alongwith Anandagiri's prAcheena shankara vijaya are not 
available for public reading. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Have anybody checked the Brihat Sankara Vijaya, which should be the most 
authentic account. It seems a copy of that is the Kanchi Kamakoti Math.

I hope you know Adi Sankara is a great Jeevan Mukta and he has become
Brahman. Brahmaiva San Brahmaiva Bhavati.

For him how can he lose his Brahmacharya when he has become Brahman?
If he can lose Brahmacharya there is no meaning for Brahma Jnana at
all.

Even if such Jeevan Mukta is enjoying 1000s of women in the Antahpura
nothing will happen to his Brahmacharya. You and I cannot question why
he is doing some things like Parkaya Pravesha. It is all his Leela
only. You can ask why his Sishyas had to wake him up from the King's
body. But he is simply showing how ignorant man is foolishly going for
enjoying things in the world.   He is teaching a lesson for us.

Explanations / justifications like this can be given on any person's 
questionable activities.  It is only because of our subjective attachment 
& high regards to that person we will be finding the ways to justify 
his/her deeds.  As an outsider, if you want to do the sUkshma vichAra with 

an objective mentality, you would hardly get convincing and logical 
answers to these activities.  First of all a brahmavida, paramArtha jnAni, 

does not have to do the saNkalpa to do parakAya pravesha that to satisfy 
the totally irrelevant question on kAma shAstra asked by an orthodox 
gruhiNi to the para puruSha and saNyAsi.  Secondly, a jeevan mukta does 
not engage himself dharma bAhira, nishiddha karma-s.  Because for him even 

dharma vihita, vedOkta karma-s itself avidyAtmaka.  Shankara clarifies 
clearly in his brahma sUtra bhAshya.  Thirdly, a jnAni, in whose 
antaHkaraNa, there is no katrutva bhOktrutva bhAva, does not have to do 
any yOgic exercises (like vajrOli) to maintain brahmacharya.  It also does 

not mean a saNyAsi/jeevan mukta can 'enjoy' stree sanga any no. of times 
without losing his brahmacharya.  In short, what shankara did in 
shareerAntara (king's body) is sva-varNAshrama viruddha.  padmapAda, 
hence,  rightly asks shankara vratamasmadeeyamatulaM kva mahat, kva cha 
kAmashAstraM atigarhyaM idaM??  tadapeeshyate bhagavataiva yadi, 
hyanavasthitaM jagadihaiva bhavet.  mAdhava did clarify these doubts in 
his shankara vijaya, but those clarifications again not so convincing & 
according to vedAnta prakriya. 

So, IMO, instead of scratching our heads about these debatable incidents, 
we have to try to understand bhagavadpAda's noble personality through 
svayaM virachita bhAshya-s only.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
