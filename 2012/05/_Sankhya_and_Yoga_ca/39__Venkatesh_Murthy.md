Namaste

One Question-

Adi Sankara's Sukshma Sarira entered into the King's body OR only the
Atma? Because if only Atma there is no fear of losing Brahmacharya.
There is no effect of enjoying by body on Atma. It is a witness only.
Even if body is enjoying women and other things Atma is never a
Bhokta. If he said he will have to practice Vajroli to protect
Brahmacharya this means his Atma with some Upadhis like Mind went into
the King's body. When he came back to his own body  he had to do
Vajroli to protect his Brahmacharya. Is this correct?
