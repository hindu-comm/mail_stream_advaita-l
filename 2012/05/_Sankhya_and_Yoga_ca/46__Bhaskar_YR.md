He is showing how ordinary persons can become trapped enjoying nice
things and the foolishness. But he was not actually trapped in King's
body.

No, I think you have not read the mAdhaveeya completely.  As cautioned by 
padmapAda, shankara indeed 'trapped' in King's body completely and lost 
himself !!  His shishya vrunda had to sing 8 songs to 'awake' AchArya from 
king's body.  While in king's body, Acharya has become expert in 
vAtsyAyana kAma sUtra & its bhAshya and has written one new dissertation 
called Amaraka kAvya.  One of the biographer explains that shankara 
experienced 'nirargaLa brahmAnanda'  in King's body when having 'contact' 
with women in antaHpura :-)) So, according to mAdhaveeya, he is actually 
trapped in king's body and his disciples had to try hard to get him out 
:-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
