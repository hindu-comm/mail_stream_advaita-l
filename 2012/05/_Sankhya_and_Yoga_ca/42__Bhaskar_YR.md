praNAms Sri Venkatesh prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Because it is very interesting people are attracted to this. Other
Mata Gurus like Ramanujacharya and Madhvacharya could not do this
supernatural trick.

>  This episode of supernatural trick could only at the best belittle the 
stature of sanyAsi & celibate shankara.  It only proves that, shankara, a 
brahmachAri / saNyAsi, just to answer an irrelevant question of 
ubhayabhArati and to get a 'practical' experience of kAma shAtra violated 
the saNyAsi/yati dharma & could not follow the brahmacharya in vAcha & 
manasa.  mAdhaveeya mentions that even after the 'purpose' is served, 
shankara in king's body reluctant to return to his original body (as he 
forgotten his true svarUpa !!??) due to attachments & enjoyments he 
experienced in King's body !!

But we have to do very Sukshma Vichara to analyse this story and not
avoid discussion. 

>  As sri vidya prabhuji observed, we should realize that these episodes & 
exaggerations of the same is nothing but mere poetic expressions of the 
author who wants to glorify the hero of the biography.  Too much reading 
into these episodes would only lead to more disaster. 

Sri Sunil is saying Vajroli will pull in lost seed and protect 
Brahmacharya. But we have to see seed loss was happening in the King's 
body but not Adi Sankara's body. 

>  But this 'seed loss' in King's body is due to shankara's sanyAsi 
buddhi/mana which did the parakAya pravesha in King's body to learn the 
nuances of kAma shAstra, is it not?? what does it mean?? vajroli could 
prevent the semen loss but what happened to brahmacharya paripAlana in 
vAcha & manasa which is also equally important alongwith kAya??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
