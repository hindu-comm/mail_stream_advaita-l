He is showing how ordinary persons can become trapped enjoying nice
things and the foolishness. But he was not actually trapped in King's
body.

This is my point. Even though it is Leela of Adi Sankara he is
teaching others how to behave in Parakaya Pravesha. If some one is
doing Parakaya Pravesha today and enjoying like how Adi Sankara was
doing he has to do Vajroli when he comes back to his body. Say some
person A goes into B's body and enjoys B's things including woman. If
A wants to protect his Brahmacharya when he returns back to his body
he has to do Vajroli. Because the memories of the enjoyments will be
strong when he comes back. To stop thinking about them and to make
Kundalini flow upwards he has to do Vajroli.

But Adi Sankara does not have to do Vajroli. Because he is already
Jeevan Mukta. His Brahmacharya is always there and never lost.
