Namaste

I hope you know Adi Sankara is a great Jeevan Mukta and he has become
Brahman. Brahmaiva San Brahmaiva Bhavati.

For him how can he lose his Brahmacharya when he has become Brahman?
If he can lose Brahmacharya there is no meaning for Brahma Jnana at
all.

Even if such Jeevan Mukta is enjoying 1000s of women in the Antahpura
nothing will happen to his Brahmacharya. You and I cannot question why
he is doing some things like Parkaya Pravesha. It is all his Leela
only. You can ask why his Sishyas had to wake him up from the King's
body. But he is simply showing how ignorant man is foolishly going for
enjoying things in the world.   He is teaching a lesson for us.
