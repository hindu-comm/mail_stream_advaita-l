Adi Sankara could not violate Sanyasi Dharma because he was a Jivan
Mukta. For him there is no rule and obligation. He can do whatever he
pleases and it will be correct.
According to you he violated Sanyasi Dharma when he cremated his
mother's body. But why are you not objecting to that cremation?
Because you think he showed respect for his mother? This type of
thinking is double standards. When he cremated his mother he did a
good thing but when he enjoyed in King's body he did a bad thing. This
type of judgement of Adi Sankara is wrong. We have accept whatever he
did. We must say it is all good. Because a Jivan Mukta is not bound by
rules of Dharma. He has already reached the highest. He can enjoy
whatever he wants but nothing will take away his Moksha already
gained.

We have to do Sukshma Vichara because the mother cremation episode is
also there. We have to compare the two and conclude correctly.

You are correct Vacha and Manasa are important for ordinary Sanyasi.
But Adi Sankara was not ordinary. For him there is no loss of
Brahmacharya in any body either King's body or his own body. But  he
did Vajroli to teach and guide others not like him. The Parakaya
Pravesha episode is a Leela of Adi Sankara only. Cremation of mother's
body is also a Leela only. We cannot question him.
