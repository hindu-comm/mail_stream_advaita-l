Namaste,

That he was asked to do Paranayama in the ratio 1 : 2 : 2 may be a fact and it could be probably because his guru did not want his Kundalini jagarana to be fast. That he knew Vajroli wasby his own admission. How can you say no that?

Namaste

In some book I remember Sri Abhinava Vidya Teertha has said he was
doing Pranayama in the ratio 1-4-2. Inhale for some time. Hold breath
for 4 X time and Exhale for 2 X time. But his Guru asked to do the
ratio 1-2-2. He did not do Vajroli.
