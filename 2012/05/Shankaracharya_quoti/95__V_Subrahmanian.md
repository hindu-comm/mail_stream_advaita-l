Namaste.

Many  thanks for the references.  My question was aimed at finding out if
it was true that Shankara had not 'touched' the Ramayana (in the prasthAna
traya bhashyas).  During the recent Bhashya pArAyaNa sattram where I
participated, I had been allotted the latter half of the BSB and I located
this sentence there.  While discussing this with others assembled there, I
was told that Shankara has mentioned about Bharata's noble brotherhood in
the Br.U.Bhashya.  Could someone pl. cite the reference please?


Warm regards,
subrahmanian.v
