Namaste,

The sloka *mA niSAda....* contains the essence of rAmAyaNa and vAlmiki has encoded
6 sargAs in it.

Infact, this curse is considered to be maNgaLa slOka. Prior to this incident, 
valmiki was initiated in rAma charitra by sage nArada. So, his heart was filled with
rAma bhakti. 

So, even though he cursed the hunter, it was visualized as a maNgaLa slOka.
Here, niSAda is Lord Rama; among the krauncha mithuna, the male bird is rAvaNa;
the female bird is manDOdari. The niSAda hits the male bird ie., kills rAvaNa and female bird was weeping ie., maNDOdari was weeping beside the dead body of rAvaNa.

regs,
sriram
