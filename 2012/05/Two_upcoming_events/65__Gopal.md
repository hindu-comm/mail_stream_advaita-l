To everyone who wanted a better version of the Maharudram - DC souvenir:
There is a simpler PDF version available now from www.maharudram2012.org.
Kindly follow the link in the souvenir section.

To those who wanted printed copy, we will be mailing them in the coming
days to the addresses you have emailed me.

Thanks,
