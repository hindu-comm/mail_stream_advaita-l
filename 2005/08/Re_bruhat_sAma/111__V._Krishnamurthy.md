Namaste, Bhaskar Prabhuji,

Of the Saama Hymns, "I am BRRihat-saama" says the Lord,
because, this BRRihat-saama is regarded as the most
prominent  and best of hymns, in the Saama Veda. Swami
Ramsukhdas mentions this idea in his commentary on the Gita
and says: "In 'Atiraatrayaaga' it is a PRRishhTa-stotra
(endorsed hymn)".  

I don't understand what he says. But scholars may take it
up from here.

PraNAms to all seekers of Truth.
