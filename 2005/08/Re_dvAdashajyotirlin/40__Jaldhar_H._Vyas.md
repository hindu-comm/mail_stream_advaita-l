With the month of Shravana starting today, it is fitting that we should 
remember the holy names and forms of Shiva Bhagavan

These verses are recited as a standalone stotra but they also form chapter 
1, verses 21-24 of the Kotirudra Samhita of the Shiva Mahapurana.  There 
are a few variant readings in the text which I shall note below

"In Saurashtra Somanatha[1], and on [the mountain] Shrishaila Mallikarjuna[2].
In Ujjain Mahakala[3] and Omkara in Mamaleshvara[4]."

[1] Saurashtra is the peninsular part of Gujarat and Somanatha is the 
famous tirth on its shore.  Somanatha is the lord of the moon.  Shiva 
Bhagavan wears the crescent moon in his hair.

[2] Shrishaila is a mountain in Andhra Pradesh also known in the 
shastras as Kraunchachala where is located the temple of Mallikarjuna.
Mallika is Parvati and Arjuna is another name for Shiva.

[3] Ujjain or Avantika in Maharashtra is the residence of Shiva Bhagavan 
as Mahakala, Great all-conquering Time.  In Jyotisha, Ujjain is considered 
the "Greenwich" of reckoning time i.e. the prime meridian passes through it.

[4] Omkareshvara and Mamaleshvara are actually two seperate lingas but 
they are counted as one for some reason.  Some variants of the shloka 
say parameshvara instead of Mamaleshvara.  They are located on opposite 
sides of the Narmada river in Madhya Pradesh.  Omkara is self-explanatory.

> paralyAM vaidyanAtha.n cha DAkinyAM bhImasha~Nkaram |
> setubandhe tu rAmeshaM nAgeshaM dArukAvane ||

"In Paralaya, Vaidyanatha[5], Bhimashankara in Dakini[6].
At Setubandha Ramesha[7], and also Nagesha[8] in the Daruka forest."

[5] Vaidyanatha means the lord of doctors as Shiva Bhagavan heals all 
pain.  The area called Paralaya is in Southern Bihar. A variant has
Chittabhumi instead of Paralaya.

[6] There are two claimants to this Jyotirlinga.  One is in Maharashtra on 
the banks of the Bhima river.  Both the river and the linga are named 
after a King called Bhima or Bhimak who was a great saint.

Others say it is in Assam.  There was an asura called Bhima who was 
killed by Shiva Bhagavan there.

[7] Setubandha at the very tip of India in Tamil Nadu, is the location of 
Bhagavan Rameshvara.  According to the Ramayana, Shri Rama worshipped 
Shiva Bhagavan there before building the bridge to Lanka.

[8] Nageshvara is the lord of snakes.  Shiva bhagavan wears them around 
his neck.  This tirth is located between Somanath and Dwarka in Gujarat.


> vArANasyA.n tu vishvesha.n tryambakaM gautamItaTe |
> himAlaye tu kedAra.n ghushmesha.n cha shivAlaye ||
>

"In Varanasi Vishvesha[9], and Tryambaka[10] on the banks of the Gautami river.
also Kedara[11] in the Himalayas and Ghushmesha[12] in Shivalaya."

[9] The Shiva Purana notes that the entire city of Kashi or Varanasi is 
sacred to Shiva Bhagavan.  But the chief of the Shivalingas there is 
Vishvanath the lord of the entire universe.

[10]  Gautami is another name for the holy river Godavari.  The temple of 
Tryambakeshvara is located on its banks in Maharashtra.  Tryambaka means 
having three eyes.  Shiva Bhagavan has the regular two eyes of mundane 
vision and the third eye of jnana.

[11] Kedarnath is a very popular and famous tirth in the Himalayas along 
with Badarinath.  Kedar is the name of the mountain on which it is located.

[12] This jyotirlinga is located near Daulatabad Maharashtra.  Shiva 
Bhagavan became resident there because of a woman named Ghushma.

"If a man recites [the names of] these Jyotirlingas, evening and morning,
seven lifetimes worth of sins will be destroyed by their recollection."

By merely looking at them [the jyotirlingas], one is no longer touched by 
sin. One then becomes detached from karma and thus pleases the Great Lord.
