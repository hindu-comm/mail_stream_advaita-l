The BSB 4.1.13 does not specifically speak about praarabdha from
the GYAnI's viewpoint versus the aGYAnI's.

praNAms Sri Karthik prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes prabhuji...there is no specific mention of prArabdha karma & its
influence on jnAni in this sUtra bhAshya..Moreover, in this sUtra
commentary itself shankara categorically declares that after the dawn of
ultimate knowledge jnAni realizes that he was/is/will not be the body nor
an embodied self at any point of time...

But in vEdAnta sUtra 4-1-14, as Sri Ramesh prabhuji said, shankara does
talk about the realization *after* falling off of the body (sharIrapAte
muktiurityAvadAryati)...but this view point is from vyavahAra where we
believe the bhaddha state of jIva & his entanglement with BMI..But shankara
very early in his shArIraka mImAmsa (1-1-4 samanvayAdhikaraNa sUtra
bhAshya) clarified that embodiedness is due to a false notion &
bodilessness is the very nature of a jnAni even it appears he is *living*
in a body!!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
