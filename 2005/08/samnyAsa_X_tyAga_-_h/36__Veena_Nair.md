I frequently read the English translation of Shankaracharya's Gita Bhashya 
(translation by Dr.A.G.Krishna Warrier -Ramkrishna Math, Mylapore). My 
understanding is that for ordinary human beings sanyasa and tyaga shd be 
viewed as a two-step process. Once tyaga is possible i.e. the renunciation 
of the fruits of works, then sanyasa is the next goal and that is the 
renunciation of all works. The first step i.e. giving up of attachment to 
works leads to performance of all work without attachment; this in turn 
purifies the mind and makes one fit to ponder over the Self (which I think 
means the Param-atma). But again this distinction between tyaga and sanyasa 
is meant only for the non-self--knowers or those who are still very much in 
the material world and bound to works e.g., Arjuna. Let me quote from the 
text: "...the alternatives stated as between renunication (sanyasa) and 
relinquishment (tyaga) in the present context are addressed exclusively to 
those directed to perform work. Those wedded to knowledge, the Saamkhyas, 
who have realised the Supreme Reality, are called upon to devote themselves 
to the discipline of knowledge marked by the total renunciation of all 
works, and not to aught else. There are no alternatives before them." (p. 
553). 
I hope other group members will also respond and throw more light on the 
matter. Thanks. 
Om Namo Narayanaya.
