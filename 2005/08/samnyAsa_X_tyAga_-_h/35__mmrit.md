Thank you for your sugestion. The problem is to make a text hard to
understand for people who is not expert in this subject. And, here in
Brazil, we have poor gItA translations. I think it's probably the best your
idea, but I'm afraid that solution -to put sanskrit terms [samnyAsa and
tyAga], beyond the essencial [like karma, dharma, and so on]-, withdraw
non-experts from text.
