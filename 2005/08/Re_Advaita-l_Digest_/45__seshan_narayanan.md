Namaskaram 

Thank you very much for the explanation. I have one or two queries on
what you have mentioned? What does the tridandi signify? Do you also
mean that for Sri Vaishnavites, it is from Grihasta to Vanaprastha to
sanyasa?
I am told that the Dasanaami system is one of the popular norms for
Sanyasa. If so, what do the Sri Vaishnavites follow?
I understand that they retain the Yajnopavitam,  What does it signify
for them after renunciation?

Awaiting your reply
