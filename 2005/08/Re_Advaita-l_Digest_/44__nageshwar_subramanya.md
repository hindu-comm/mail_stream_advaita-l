Namaskaram Seshan Narayanan,

In Sanyasa Ashrama when they take sanyasa in the river they used to leave  all the belongings what they have before sanyasa  so at that time the Guru who is going to give the Paramahamsa mantra (  Sanyasa )  he gives the kashaya vastra( Safforn Clothes ) Kamandalam , Dandam  Paduka s etc .Here your Que is Dandam in Sri Vaishnava Sampradayam they use Trianda in Smarta Sampradayam we use one Dandam . One thing  in Sri Vaishnava Sampradayam they have Shikha <Yagnopavitam .Here he Enjoys  all the ashrama And later he comes to This ,But now a days we are some ofthem taking Dierct Sanyasa  .



what is the difference between tridandi and Ekadandi orders of
Sannyasa> Are there any more such clarssifications?

regards
