Sanyasis of all Vaishnava traditions do not wear yajnopavita. For
instance, sanyasis of Dvaita sect do not wear it. Sanyasis of Ekadandi
order (advaita/dvaita) do not wear it. Those belonging to Tridandi
(vishistadvaita) order, in general, wear it.

I have heard that those belonging to the priestly class wear an extra
yajnopavita after mastering Atharva Veda.
