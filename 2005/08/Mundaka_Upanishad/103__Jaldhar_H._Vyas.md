Actually this is still true today.  Though I doubt there has been any 
tangible economic benefit to collecting sticks for a long time.

Dana means gift.  It is not a financial transaction.

As explained in the dharmashastras, A brahmachari has to daily perform the 
rite of samidhadanam where he contributes some firewood into the fire 
kept by his Guru.

However Brahmacharya in the sense of the first ashram is not necessarily 
connected to enquiry into Brahman so perhaps it is better explained in 
this way:  upon "graduation" as it were from Vedic study, a man has the 
option of getting married, taking sannyasa or a third option, naishtika 
(lifelong) brahmacharya in which he continues to remain with his guru.

According to the amnayastotra, Advaitin naishtika brahmacharis have 
special names depending on which mula matha they belong to:

Puri       - prakAsha

Sringeri   - chaitanya

Dwarka     - svarUpa

Jyotirmath - Ananda

But I don't think this is really followed in practice.  Most people who do 
not want to become grhasthas go straight into sannyasa. Some of the modern 
outfits such as Ramakrishna Mission have a preparatory Brahmachari stage 
before taking sannyasa but it is obvious they are just aping the Christian 
idea of "novices" which is not the traditional concept of brahmacharya.

On the other hand, I have heard of some people who call themselves 
brahmachari instead of swami and whose names end in chaitanya or swarupa.
