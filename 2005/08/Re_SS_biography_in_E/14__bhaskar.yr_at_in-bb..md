The interesting point however is that this is published by the kaaryaalaya.

praNAms Sri Ramakrishna BalasubramaNian prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes, that is really paining...but fact is that unfortunately, there is no
qualified English proof reader at Karyalaya to avoid intrusion of these
type of remarks in translation works!!  Sri HS Lakshmi Narasimha Murthy,
The chief editor of Karyalaya very fluent in Kannada & Sanskrit but does
not know English!!!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
