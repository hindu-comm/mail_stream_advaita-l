namo nArAyaNAya!

dear SrI Ramesh Badisa and list members,

i would like to make a few clarifications. i think SrI
Ramesh has wrongly equated a j~nAni with ISvara. it
guess it would suffice to note that A J~NANI DOES NOT
BECOME ISVARA AFTER REALIZATION. 

anyway, to the original mail....

all the above are characteristics of ISvara and not
brahman. a j~nAni realizes that his ultimate nature is
 brahmam, not ISvara.   

btw, it is incorrect to say that something is
all-pervasive w.r.t. nirguNa brahmam.
All-pervasiveness is true only of ISvara (saguNa
brahmam). For nirguNa brahmam, one can neither talk of
pervasion or non-pervasion and hence, nirguNa brahmam
cannot be used as a standard of comparison.

from the absolute sense there is neither work nor
someone who works nor the act of working. these exist
only due to avidyA. it is precisely because a j~nAni
has attained naishkarmyasiddhi that he is called a
j~nAni. for a j~nAni, there is neither bondage nor
liberation, neither limitation nor non-limitation,
neither divine nor non-divine, neither knowledge nor
ignorance, neither vyAvahArika nor pAramArthika sattA.
in short, there is nothing other than his own nature. 

for details or references, please refer to mANDUkya
kArika or ashTAvakra gItA.
