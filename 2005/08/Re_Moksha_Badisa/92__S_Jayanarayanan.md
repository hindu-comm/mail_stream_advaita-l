"Not even Brahma, Vishnu and Siva are equal to a GYAnI." 
- Ramana Maharshi.

Shankara also says something similar (in his
upadeshasaahasrii?), "To a GYAnI, even Brahma and Indra are
pitiable objects."

To ask if a GYAnI is able to create or destroy the universe is
like asking if a king can stitch clothes. Why would a king
bother to stitch clothes when he rules a kingdom with many
tailors, who are ready to do the work for him?

The GYAnI does not associate the Self with ANY action, even if
it be the actions of Brahma, Vishnu or Siva. Even these "lofty"
actions are BENEATH a GYAnI!
