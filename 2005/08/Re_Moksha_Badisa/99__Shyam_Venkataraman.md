  *Shyam: A Gyani knows that Brahma, Vishnu and Siva are all forms of Saguna 
Brahman. Anything that has form will be deformed in course of time. He also 
knows that the higher nature of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva is the formless 
Nirgunam Brahma.*

* Gyani cannot show lordly powers because Gyani is essentially the 
reflection of the original consciousness in an inferior medium (body-mind 
complex), so the gyani's body-mind complex has inferior attributes, whereas 
Iswara is the reflection of the original consciousness in a macro medium 
(whole universe), so Iswara has superior attributes, so Iswara has the 
powers of creation, destruction etc.. but looking from the point of the 
originsl consciousness, both gyani and iswara are one and the same, but in a 
vyavaharika sense, there is a world of difference between them. So your idea 
that gyani can show lordly powers is wrong.*

  *Shyam: Your understanding is incorrect here. When a person dies, the soul 
doesn't exit. Only the sukshma sarira(the subtle body) and the reflected 
consciousness exit the physical body or gross body. In the gross body, 
original consciousness is still there, since it is all pervasive. But the 
reflected consciousness which is reflected in the mind also exits, since the 
mind is located in the subtle body.*
