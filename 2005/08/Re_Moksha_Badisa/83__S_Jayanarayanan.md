The above statements are thoroughly false. The GYAnI is free of
ALL KARMA, not just of one kind.

To quote from an old posting already discussed in this list:

---------------------------
While I understand what you are trying to explain, here is what
Ramana Maharshi says (page 422 of Talks):

The scriptures say that jnana is the fire which burns away all
karma (sarvakarmani). Sarva (all) is interpreted in two way :
(1) to include prarabhda (2) to exclude it. In the first way :
if a man with three wives dies, it is asked, "Can two of them be
called widows and the third not?" All are widows. So it is with
prarabdha, agami and sanchita. When there is no karta none of
them can hold out any longer.

        The second explanation is, however, given only to
satisfy the enquirer. It is said that all karma is burnt away
leaving prarabdha alone. The body is said to continue in the
functions for which it has taken birth. That is prarabdha. But
from the jnani's point of view, there is only Self which
manifests in such variety. There is no body or karma apart from
Self, so that the actions don't affect him.
