Btw, can you use the proper terminology instead of "absolute salvation" 
etc?  It will make it easier to understand your arguments.

...But then why care about the universe which is only a fraction of 
"absolute existence?"

The vyavaharic viewer of Brahman knows Him as the creator, protector, and 
destroyer of the universe i.e. Ishwara.  But that concept doesn't not 
fully map the nirguna parabrahman.  As the brahmasutras explain, there is 
only one Ishwara.  This is because from the vyavaharic view, there is only 
one universe.  However this doesn't mean that from the paramarthik view 
there has to only be one.

And this is the answer to the riddle.  If it is all pervasive then it 
includes the jivanmukta.  It includes Ishvara etc.  There is no difference 
between them.  And therefore the jivanmukta includes parabrahman, 
includes Ishwara. etc.  There is no difference between them.

It is the _observer_ who sees difference and that is because of its 
ignorance.

The purpose of the brahmasutra in question is to stop the sadhaka from 
going off the track by trying to become Ishwara and collect powers like 
creation, dissolution etc. instead of realizing Brahman.

The inhabitants of Brahmaloka are mukta in the sense that they have 
escaped from the cycle of samsara.  However they still identify with 
gunas.  Who we are referring to as a jivanmukta is free from feelings of 
attachment to all gunas.  This is the key to mukti whether the atma is 
free of attachment or not.  Whether the location of that atma is 
brahmaloka or a human body is arbitrary and irrelevant.
