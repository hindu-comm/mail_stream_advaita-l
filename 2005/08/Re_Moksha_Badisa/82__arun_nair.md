HariOm Badisaji,

"Karma is said to be of three types. The sanchita karma is the one
accumulated from past lives. Agama karma is that we are earning in
this life with various activities. A part of sanchita karma, given in
this life as prarabdha karma (PK) is the one we are facing now in this
life."

What about the karmaphalas earned in this life upto the point of
realisation. Does these also get burned up in the Gyan agni as aprt of
sanceti.

regards
arun

That is, the reservoir of karma is gone by the dawn of gyan, and this is where Lord Krishna says Gyan agni sarva karmani â€¦ Gita 4/37. For such a gyani, there is no agama karma, as all activities are done with selflessness. But, he still faces the fruits of PK. It means that dawn of knowledge cannot remove the PK. Then, how long gyani will face? Till they are exausted. Then, what will happen to him? He will die and then attains the absolute moksha.
