All upaniShads (sarvaH upaniShadaH) are [like] cows (gAvaH); Lord
kR^iShNa, son of the coweherd (gopAla nandanaH), is one who extracts
the milk (dogdhA); pArtha is [like] the calf (vatsaH); the milk
extracted (dugdhaM) is the great (mahat.h) nectar called gItA
(gITAmR^itaM); one who drinks this milk (bhoktA) is indeed a wise man
(sudhIH).

vasudevasutaM devaM kaMsa-chANUra-mardanam.h  |
devakI-paramAnandaM kR^iShNaM vande jagadgurum.h || 0.4 ||

I worship Sri kR^iShNa, who is the son of vasudeva; who killed kaMsa
and chANUra; who is gives great joy to his mother devakI, who is the
teacher of the world;  and who is the supreme lord.

This concludes the verses that are often used as dhyAna shloka-s for
bhagavad-gItA.  Sankara instead of composing some verses for
maN^gaLAcharaNaM,  begins his commentary  with an ancient verse
"nArAyaNaH paro.avyktAt.h ...", which extolls SrIman.h nArAyaNa as the
supreme brahman.
