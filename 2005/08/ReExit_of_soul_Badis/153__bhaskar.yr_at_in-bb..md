"From the above you are implying that there are multiple jIva-s which One
after another as an individual self identify themselves with the Absolute
?"



Badisa: The plural word, jivas or atmas or souls can be also found in the
Phala Adhyaya of BS.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

In what context??  Kindly refer shankara's stand on multiple jIva-s in
*karmAnusmrutishbdhavidhyadhikaraNa* in 3rd adhyAya...while shankara
discussing on the question *who wakes up from sushupti* says that
nAnAjIvatva is only due to avidyAupAdhi saMbhAndha.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
