I am shankar, 30 years of age, and my country of residence is India. I am 
a brahmin and I belong to adhi shankara's smarta sampradaya. My father's 
elder brother named srikantan lived with and served Kanchi sankaracharya 
Maha swamigal Pujasri Chandrasekarendra saraswathi and got the advaita 
experience through the blessings of the maha swamigal.  I am also very 
much interested in getting the advaita experience.  I am praying kanchi 
mahaswamigal for his blessings and grace.  I am also interested of their 
experiences from the list members who are doing sadhana for advaita 
experience. thanking you. yours sincerely, shankar.
