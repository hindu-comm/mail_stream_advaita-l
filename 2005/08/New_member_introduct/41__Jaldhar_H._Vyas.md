Wow! I'm so excited to finally find a discussion list dedicated
specifically to Vedanta. I've been looking for one for a while and
finally stumbled upon this by mistake!

My name is Zach, and I'm currently 18 and living in the United States. 
Even though I am not as knoweldgeable as I'd like about the subject of 
Advaita Vedanta, I am hoping to increase my knowledge and understanding by 
following the discussions on this list and asking questions. The only 
Hindu scripture I have read all the way through is the Bhagavad-Gita 
translated by Prabhavananda and Isherwood, plus Ramesh Menon's adaptation 
of the Ramayana. I've also read selections from the Upanishads and a great 
amount of general-interest material, and enough of teachers such as 
Vivekananda, Shankara, and Ramakrishna to know that Advaita Vedanta is the 
most true philosophy I have ever laid ears on.

At the moment, I am endeavoring to balance reading more scripture and 
commentary with school and work, and I've just undertaken the expansive 
project of picking up a little Sanskrit - at least enough to be able to 
read it out loud from Devanagari and to pick up general meanings. I look 
forward to future discussions with this group's members, and hope I can 
contribute something despite my beginner's level of knowledge.

  Zach
