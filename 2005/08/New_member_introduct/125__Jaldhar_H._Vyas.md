Hello,

My name is Chandrashekar. I am aged 24 and currently working as a Software 
Engineer based out of Boston, Massachusetts. I work for Satyam Computer 
Services.I am originally from India. I was born and brought up in Chennai 
and our family has close ties with the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam.  I am very 
much interested in the scriptures and especially about the Advaita 
Philosophy after a recent discussion in Chennai comparing the 3 schools of 
philosophy (Advaita, Dvaita, and Vishita-Dvaita).

I am always of the belief that getting born as a human being is rare and 
hence we must make full use of the God-Given intellect to evolve 
spiritually. I want to know, the basic premise on which the Advaita school 
of thought is based and what are the evidences from the scriptures support 
Advaita. I am also interested in knowing the meaning of various works done 
by Sri Adi Sankara especially the Bhaja Govindam, Viveka Chudamani.

I would also be interested in taking part in debates/discussions which I 
hope will help me understand Sri Sankara's works better and lead me 
towards making me a better human being.

Thanking you,

With regards

Chandrashekar
