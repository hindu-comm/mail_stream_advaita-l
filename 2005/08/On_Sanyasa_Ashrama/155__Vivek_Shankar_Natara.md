Fellow Advaitha Jigyasus,



We often celebrate the birthdays or Janmanakshatras of most holy men. Examples include Sankara jayanthi, Birthday of Sringeri Acharya, Anusha Pooja of Paramacharya of  Kanchi peetam. These days coincide with the actual janmanakshatrams of the respective Maha Swamis. But, however, when Sanyasis do Sanyasa Sweekara, they actually are supposed to kill their former identity and assume a new one. I have heard they would do athma pinda and then kill their former self before assuming the new identity. If that is the case, then why is a lot of importance given to the Janmanakshatra as the person who was born then has actually died and a new person has emerged after the sanyassa sweekara? WouldnÂ’t it  be a better idea to celebrate the day of Sanyasa Sweekara? Can some one tell me as why is the actual day of birth still important?
