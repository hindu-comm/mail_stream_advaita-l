Dear Arun,
Om Namo Narayan!!

In Sarupya.. acquire the form of Divine Beings such as Angels or Gods. Thus 
have a divine form.having body or shape similar to God."likeness to God"
In Sayujya..the Souls merge into the Supreme Being,  the one in which one 
merges into the existence of God and forgets oneÂ’s individual personality.

salokya, or "sharing the world" of God; samipya, or "nearness" to God; 
sarupya, or "likeness" to God; and sayujya, or "union" with God.
WITH REGARDS..
