Namaste to all,
I’ d like to ask a question about distinguishing features of Advaita sanyasins.  What elements of clothing or hairstyle make them look different from other sanyasins?  In other words, how a non-expert can identify them among others? 
Another question is what type of meditative practices (visualizations, concentration, or mantras)  Advaita sanyasins use at the initial stages of their spiritual journey? 
I will appreciate your answers regarding the above issues or references to web sites where such information is available. 
Thanks in advance – Danyevad – Shukriya!
Sarvam mangalam!
Andre Dmitriev
