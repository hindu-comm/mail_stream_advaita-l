  *Shyam: You have to be extremely careful when interpreting the meaning of 
the word soul. So When BS, BG or the Upanishads say that the soul is guided 
by amanuv purusha, they actually are referring to the sukshma sariram only. 
So my understanding based on listening to lectures by Swami Dayananda 
Saraswathi and Swami Paramarthananda Saraswati ( who are known authorities 
on vedanta ) that the sukshma sarira alone travels after death is correct. 
To prove this let me quote this verse from Vivekachudamani:*
** 
*idam sarvam srnu suksmasamjnitam*
*lingam tvapancikrtabhutasambhavam*
*savasanam karmaphalanubhavakam*
*svajnanato nadirupadhiratmanah*
*svapno bhavatyasya vibhaktyavastha*
*svamatrasesena vibhati yatra*
** 
*Now, I'm quoting Swami Dayananda Saraswathi directly from his book on 
"Vivekachudamani--Talks on 108 selected verses": Quote: "The subtle body or 
sukshma sarira described in this verse is called as linga sarira. The atma 
or Brahman is understood only by the subtle body; therefore it is called 
linga. There is another reason why it is called linga sarira. If it is 
present, a person is alive and if it is not there, the person is dead. 
Therefore it becomes a linga, an indication, to know whether the jiva is 
present or not in the physical body. The subtle body becomes the upadhi 
(medium) of atma. An upadhi is that which throws its attributes upon another 
thing which is in proximity. The atma in association with the subtle body 
gains the status of jiva, doer,enjoyer,seer,knower,and so on. Therefore the 
subtle body is called the upadhi of atma. The subtle body is anadi, 
beginningless. It remains in an unmanifest form at the time of 
dissolution(pralayam) and comes to manifest at the time of creation 
(shristi). Again in deep sleep or sushupti state, it becomes unmanifest. The 
jivatma (reflected consciousness, ) identified with the sukshma-sarira 
leaves the physical body in death and assumes a new body. This jiva 
(reflected consciousness + sukshma sarira) alone becomes ihaloka-paraloka 
gami, a traveller." Unquote. *
 *So from this, it is very clear that the soul refers to the sukshma sarira 
and the reflected consciousness only. The sukshma sarira is finite, whereas 
the original consciousness is infinite. So this proves what I said earlier. 
When a jivanmukta dies, he attains videha mukti. What videha mukti means is 
that he merges into the all pervading Brahman (like pot space merging into 
total space). So the jivanmukta's subtle body does not travel after death, 
it dissolves into the subtle pancha bhutani. Only in the case of an ajnani, 
the subtle body travels. In the case of an ajnani who has devoted his entire 
lifetime to upasana, the ajnani's subtle body travels to Brahma Loka where 
the ajnani attains krama mukti. So krama mukti means that the ajnani gets 
self knowledge in brahma loka and then the ajnani's subtle body is dissovled 
there and he becomes free there.* 


*Shyam: Your understanding is incorrect here. When a person dies, the soul 
> doesn't exit. Only the sukshma sarira(the subtle body) and the reflected 
> consciousness exit the physical body or gross body. In the gross body, 
> original consciousness is still there, since it is all pervasive. But the 
> reflected consciousness which is reflected in the mind also exits, since the 
> mind is located in the subtle body.*

 *Shyam: my explanation is same as for the first one. If you still think my 
understanding is wrong, I would recommend that you can take up this topic 
directly with Swami Dayananda Saraswathi. I'm sure he will vindicate me. If 
you happen to live in the US, please let me know, we can talk over this 
topic on the phone. Thanks *
