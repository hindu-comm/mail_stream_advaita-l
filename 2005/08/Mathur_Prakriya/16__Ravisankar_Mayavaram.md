.With the help of Sri Mani Sastrigal I am trying to work this
monograph atleast upto Adhyasa Bhashya based on a book written by
Holenarsipur  Swamigal called Sugama.(Ganguli translation is quite
horrible in respect of books published)Just as I have made available
the brief book on Brahmasuthra as well as Advaitha siddhi by V
Swaminathan to this web site I will make this monograph also available
when it is ready.Till then please wait patiently
