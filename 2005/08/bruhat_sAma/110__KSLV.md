Pranams Bhaskarji.
In this Chapter, the Lord describes himself like this:
Among months I am mArgazhi
Among seasons I am am Vasantharuthu
Among Vedas I am Samaveda, etc.

this means that he is NUMERO UNO among others. When he says he is Brahatsama 
in Samaveda, that explains the importance of Brahatsama, within Samaveda.

Regards
Ramesh
