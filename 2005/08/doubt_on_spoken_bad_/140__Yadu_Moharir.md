Namste:

In this context Mahabharat give an interesting twist by recommending us to remain practical.


na narma yukta.n vachanaM hinasti 
na strIShu rAjanna vivAha kAle . 
prANAtyaye sarvadhanApahAre 
pa~nchAnR^itAnyAhurapAtakAni ..MB. aadiparva 78. 16..

Meaning - It is OK to lie at following five occasions.  During joking, with women, at the time of marriage, when life is at stake or when all your possession could be lost.

Similar thoughts get echoed in ManusmR^Iti as well -

kaaminiiShu vivaaheShu gavaa.m bhakxe tathendhane |
braahmaNaabhyupapattau ca shapathe naasti paatakam || manusmR^iti 8.12 ||

Meaning - It is OK to lie to women (may be this was advised to men who had more than one wife to sat say to one or each one them that he loves her the most or she is the most favorite ... etc.;  in order to keep peace and harmony in the family unit), at the time of marriage (may be this could be like, " I will not marry anybody else".  ... etc   ),  While trying to get feed for the cow, Fuel for cooking or while trying to protect Brahmans.  During the occasions lies do not get classified as "paataka".

So dharmashaastra does give a "license to l.ie" on specific occasions.

Regards,

Dr. Yadu

Satyam bruyaat, priyam bruyaat, na bruyaat satyam apriyam.

Speak the truth, speak Love, also do not speak truth which is unpalatable
