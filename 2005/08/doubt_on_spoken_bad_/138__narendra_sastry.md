namaste all
 i am narendra sastry bowing to all learned souls.
 i am having a pecular question, such as is there any scriptures such as 
puranic stories or subhashita anything which tells the importance of using 
only GOOD WORDS and avoiding BAD WORDS for any reason while we speak every 
day.
also would like to know what the effect on mind and body if one continuously 
uses bad words and also how to avoid bad words permanently? please do advice

-- 
cheers
narendra sastry
