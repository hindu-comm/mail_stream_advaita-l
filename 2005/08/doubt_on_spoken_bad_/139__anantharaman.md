Among the very famous verses quoted from the scriptures, the following stands out in context:

Satyam bruyaat, priyam bruyaat, na bruyaat satyam apriyam.

Speak the truth, speak Love, also do not speak truth which is unpalatable

uses bad words and also how to avoid bad words permanently? please do advice
