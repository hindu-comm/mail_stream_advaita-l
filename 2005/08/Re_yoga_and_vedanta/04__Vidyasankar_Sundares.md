A further correction to yesterday's clarification -

>"... at a philosophical level, we always have to remember that veda is
>Sruti, while Sankara's bhAshyas are not. Indeed, neither Sankara himself,
>nor any of the later representatives of the tradition, have claimed that 
>his
>bhAshyas are Sruti."
>
>One, this does not mean that Sankara's bhAshyas deviate from the veda. Two,
>this does not mean that the bhAshyas carry the utmost weight for the

I meant to say, "Two, this does not mean that the bhAshyas do not carry the 
utmost weight for the advaita school."
