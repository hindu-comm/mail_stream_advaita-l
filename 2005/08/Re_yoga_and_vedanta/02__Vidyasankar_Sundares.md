I think a clarification of my previous post in this thread is in order, as I 
have received a few private emails about it. I had written,

"... at a philosophical level, we always have to remember that veda is 
Sruti, while Sankara's bhAshyas are not. Indeed, neither Sankara himself, 
nor any of the later representatives of the tradition, have claimed that his 
bhAshyas are Sruti."

One, this does not mean that Sankara's bhAshyas deviate from the veda. Two, 
this does not mean that the bhAshyas carry the utmost weight for the advaita 
school.

However, the primacy of Sruti as a pramANa should not be compromised by 
equating the text of the bhAshyas to the veda. This would completely 
preclude dialogue with other schools even within the vedAnta traditions. 
After all, if SrIvaishNavas start saying that rAmAnuja's works are equal to 
veda and if mAdhvas claim similarly for AnandatIrtha's works and so on, then 
each tradition ends up isolated in its claims about what is the veda and 
what is not.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
