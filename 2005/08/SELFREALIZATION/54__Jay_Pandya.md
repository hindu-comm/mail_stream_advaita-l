you could  not be more wrong on celibacy.........
according to RAMANA MAHARISHI.........brahmacharya has nothing to do with ritention of
sperm...............bhramacharya means to be established in brahman.................

also note wilful sanyasa was discouraged both by RAMANA MAHARISHI and
 SRI RAMAKRISHNA...............

the JNANI AFTER self realisattion might or might not participate in any and any number of actions.

if you were right then mere removal of sexual organ would result in self realisation......is that  so  ??                jp
