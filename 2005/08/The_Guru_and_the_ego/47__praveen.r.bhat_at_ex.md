praNAm,

(If you were expecting a response, Aditya-ji, here's one try of mine!
Otherwise, pls ignore :)

Finding a guru, or having found the guru, submissal is the most essential
factor. Ego has no play there. Again, another thing I wonder is why do you
say that the ego is bloated at being hurt? Is it not so when being praised,
instead? Guru's killing the ego on the spot is like asking that the guru
should *give* jnaana/moksha on the spot. :)

All in good time.

shivam shaantam advaitam,
