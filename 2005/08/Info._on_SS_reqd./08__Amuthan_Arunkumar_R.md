namo nArAyaNAya!

dear list members,

can someone provide me an online link to SrI
satchidAnandendra sarasvatI's biography, works, etc.? 

when i searched the archives, two web-pages were
mentioned (http://www.culturalindia.com/karya.html and
www.indiawebsites.com/karyalaya.htm), but both of them
don't seem to work. 

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
