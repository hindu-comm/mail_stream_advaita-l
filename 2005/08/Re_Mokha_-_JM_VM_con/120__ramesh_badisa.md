Namaste:

Muktika Up. I-ii-6: 

* the accumulated Karmas will be dissolved, the three kinds of bodies (gross, subtle and causal) are abandoned and like the ether of the pot when released from its Upadhi, rise to the level of fullness called Videha-mukti (VM). This indeed is the Absolute Liberation (Kaivalya-mukti)

 Badisa: Question (Q): When are the three kinds of bodies abandoned? 

Answer (A):  At the time of death of the physical body of knower of Brahman.

 * released from its Upadhi. 

Q: Who got released, and from where?

A: The atma is released from its Upadhi. 

 * Then, it rises to the level of fullness

Q: Who rose to the level of fullness?

A: The released atma.

 Q: When in Upadhi, was the atma at the level of fullness? 

A: No. If it were full when in Upadhi, then there is no necessity to declare that the atma has risen to the level of fullness after release from Upadhi by this Upanishad. 

 Q: What is this level of fullness called?

A: VM. 

 Q: Is VM an absolute salvation?

A: Yes.

 Q: Now, in view of above understanding, can the state of jeevan mukti (JM) be called an absolute mukti?

A: From the above description of Upanishad, the answer for this question is no.

 Q: Why? 

A:  Because, before releasing from the body, the atma is not to the level of fullness. 

 II-i-1:

 VM (liberation without the body) is from the destruction of Prarabdha (operative) karma (PK), like the space in a pot released from the conditioning pot

 Badisa: From the above declaration by the Upanishad, it is very clear that the soul of gyani has to be released from the Upadhi to attain the level of fullness. This is called absolute salvation. 

 Q: When VM is declared as absolute salvation by this Upanishad, then what is the state of JM be called?

A: State of realization, that he is him. 

 Conclusion: What ever I am saying all along in my postings is consistent with sruti declaration. Thus, the conclusion is that state of JM is realization that he is him, while in absolute salvation atma is paramatma. It is secondless, all pervasive, all powerful etc. By saguna Brahman aspect, the universe is created, maintained and dissolved. These are not possible for jeevan mukta as well as liberated soul at Brahma Lok as they havent attained the level of fullness. The statements declared by our acharyas that JM is actual state of absolute salvation are well very known, and need to be understood in the secondary sense. By this, the concept of jeevan mukti is not disturbed. Assumption of this concept in the primary sense leads to clash with Brahmasutra and Upanishads, as indicated in the last two postings, and with secondary sense, no clash.    

 Namaste

Badisa
