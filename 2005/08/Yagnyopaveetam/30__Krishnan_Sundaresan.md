Here is a link containing "rules" from manusmriti concerning the yagnopaveetham
http://www.hinduism.co.za/sacred1.htm

A brahmachari or the bachelor (also, a learner) wears a single sacred
thread. The householder or the married person wears two. A person who
is married and has lost one or both of his parents wears three.
