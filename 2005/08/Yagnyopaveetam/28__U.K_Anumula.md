What is the significance of "yagnyopaveetam (sacred thread)?  Why is it worn 
by some castes and not by others? Is there any significance to the number of 
threads a 'brahmachari' can wear as contrasted with the number worn by 
married persons?  Is there a uniform code for wearing the yagyopaveetam for 
all Hindus?
