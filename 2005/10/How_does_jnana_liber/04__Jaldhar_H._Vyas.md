The final realization (thou art that) is just knowledge. As soon as
avidya is burnt by brahmanjnana one tends to perceive brahman in everything
and everything in brahman Â– just a continuum. How can acquiring knowledge
release one from cycle of births and deaths, for knowledge is purely mental
and not a physical phenomenon?
