*Om Namo Narayanaya.
* I have always thought about the creation of the Universe and find it
difficult to understand why the Lord creates and destroys the Universe? I
found here on Prof Vk's website in the run-up to the Bhagavatham that Vidur
has asked Maitreya that question and I quote below Vidur's question and
Maitreya's answer:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* *

*"How is it, the Absolute which is immutable and which is beyond all guNas,
resorts to action resulting in creation of the universe? Even as a Leela, is
it not incompatible with the nirguNa nature of the Transcendental Absolute?"
(III – 7 – 2). *

* "You said, Oh Maitreya, that it is through avidyA (Cosmic Ignorance) that
the Lord creates, sustains and dissolves the universe. But He the Almighty
is beyond time and space. How did He associate Himself with avidyA? In all
bodies the experiencer that is the jIva is also nothing but a spark of the
Absolute. How can he then lose the Bliss that he came from and how can he
suffer because of actions?" (III – 7 – 4 to 6).*

* Maitreya replies (III – 7 – 9):*

* seyaM bhagavato mAyA yanna yena virudhyate / *

*Ishvarasya vimuktasya kArpaNyam-uta bandhanaM //*

* In fact, it appears to be a contradiction that to the Lord who is devoid
of all avidyA, there happens due to avidyA a bondage and a fall of
Knowledge. "*

Please can someone elaborate some more on Maitreya's answer with some
helpful examples in simple language? You will be doing a spiritual seeker, a
novice, an invaluable service!
Pranams.
