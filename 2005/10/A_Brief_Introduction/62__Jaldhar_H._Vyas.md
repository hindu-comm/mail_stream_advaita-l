That's a deficiency in your book I think.  The shuklayajurveda has an
anukramanika by Maharshi Katyayana which lists these things so I would
think Krshnayajurveda had the same.

Would knowledgable south Indians care to comment?

  .BTW how about the stories

Yes, by tradition the shuklayajurveda is younger than the other shakhas.

That's my Gujarati pronounciation affecting it.  The proper Sanskrit is
chhandas for the root form and chhanda.h for the first singular.
