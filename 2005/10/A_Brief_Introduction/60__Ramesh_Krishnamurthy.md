** I am not suggesting anything of that sort. The R^ig veda says
"praj~nAnaM brahma" and the yajurveda says "aham brahmAsmI". These are
not different siddhAnta-s. However, it is generally believed that the
R^ishhi who saw "praj~nAnaM brahma" lived before the R^ishhi who saw
"aham brahmAsmI". It does not really matter as both the statements are
equally anAdi, apaurushheya, etc

As an aside, I would like to know what transliteration scheme you are
following when use 'E' as in 'vEda'. The scheme used by shrii
vidyAsha.nkar on the advaita vedAnta home page is a slight
modification of ITRANS, but neither of these schemes use 'E' or 'O'.
