Yajurveda is just a rearrangement of rks for the use of the adhvaryu 
priest. Samaveda is a rearrangement of rks for the use of the udgatr 
priest.  Even the Atharvaveda mostly consists of rks also found in the 
Rgveda.  Thus is can be said that the Rgveda is the source of the other 
three.  However it must be said, that all three contain material which is 
not found in the Rgveda and cannot be simply dismissed as younger.

Yajus are prose not poetry so they do not have a chanda per se (though we 
say yajus as the chanda) but they do have rshi and Devata.  The rks of 
course have all three.
