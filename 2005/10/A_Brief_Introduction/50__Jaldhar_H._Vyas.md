I'm afraid you're still missing the point a little.  What do we mean by 
the word "meaning?"  Perhaps an analogy is in order.  A mistake in a 
computer program is called a bug.  This word has passed out of the narrow 
circle of computer scientists into popular parlance.  It is even found in 
dictionaries etc.  But why bug?  It seems in the early days of computing 
Grace Hopper, a pioneer in the field, had a problem in one of her programs 
she simply could not explain.  It turned out a moth (a literal "bug") had 
got into the computer and caused a short circuit which burned out one of 
the vacuum tubes (this was long before the invention of the silicon chip) 
and caused the malfunction.

Now this story is colorful and interesting and nice to know but do you 
agree it is not necessary to know it in order to talk meaningfully about 
computer bugs?  This is what our acharya were saying about the literal 
meaning of mantras.  It is not that one shouldn't know the literal 
meanings.  Acharyas such as Shayana, Uvata, Mahidhara, Haradatta, 
Skandaswami etc. have written bhashyas explaining the grammatical and 
etymological meanings of the Vedas.  It is just that this type of meaning 
takes a back seat to knowing the correct pronounciation, Rshi, Chanda, 
devata etc.  which is also meaningful in its own way.

No we should not be content with partial understanding.  We should ideally 
know _both_ the literal and the practical meanings of the mantras.  But in 
less than ideal situations, the practical is more important.
