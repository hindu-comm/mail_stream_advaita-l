Note the meaning being discussed is the _literal_ meaning.  Acharyas do in 
fact teach that this mantra is for agnihotra, this one for vivaha etc. 
And that is a "meaning" too.  Not knowing the literal meaning of mantra is 
suboptimal and one should try and learn it.  However not knowing the 
correct pronounciation of a mantra is a calamity.  Hence the Acharyas put 
greater emphasis on pronounciation.
