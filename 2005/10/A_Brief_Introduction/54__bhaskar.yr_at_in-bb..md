It is just that this type of meaning
takes a back seat to knowing the correct pronounciation, Rshi, Chanda,
devata etc.  which is also meaningful in its own way.

In Rig vEda maNtra-s for almost all sUkta-s & maNtra-s we can find Rshi,
chaNdas & dEvata but for yajurvEda sUktha-s/maNtra-s  normally we dont find
that very often (except at one or two places)  what would be the reason??
Also I want to know why traditionalists say Rig vEda is the ancient one
when compared to other vEda-s??  dont we say vEdA-s are anAdi,
apaurushEya??  how can Rig vEda be chronologically *older* to other vEdA??
pls. clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
