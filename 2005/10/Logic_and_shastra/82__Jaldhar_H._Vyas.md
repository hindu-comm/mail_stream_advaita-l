The question was not whether Buddha was anti-veda but whether Shankaracharya 
was anti-Buddha and the answer is a resounding yes.

Note he also doesn't spare any criticism of "Vedic" schools such as 
Samkhya/Yoga whic he feels falls short of the mark.

As the generally accepted date amongst historians and traditionalists alike is 
788-820 AD that hardly poses a problem.  As for Abhinava Shankara, I have not 
ever heard that name or the theory that he wrote brahmasutrabhashya before. 
Can you provide a reference please?

Well in the 21st century, they accept the date 788-820.  I know of no serious 
historian who puts the dates of Shankaracharya any more than a century earlier 
than this.

You wrote the preceding off the list but I'm taking the liberty of replying 
here in case anyone can help with this question because I, alas, cannot.
