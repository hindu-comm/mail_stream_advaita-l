Dear Vyasji,

Namaskar,

There was a misprint in my last email, sent a little
while ago. Please read :  According to Dr.
Radhakrishnan Buddha was a reformer of Brahminism.

Also two words were left out after 'historians'.
Please read ' historians are opining ----'

Sorry for the incovenience. 

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya

Rehards
