Pranams:
 While you cannot effectively describe how a gulabjamun tastes, the idea is
that one can infer from science that the certain chemical constituents of
the sweet cause the sweet taste. In fact, one could, in a laboratory,
breakdown the 'taste' portion of the sweet only and give it to a person and
say that due to this chemical, you get the said taste.
 My whole point in relation to science and shastras is that can we infer
that consciousness is the reality that talked of in the shastras through a
scientific approach. We might now realize it but can it be inferred?
 Humble pranams, Mahesh
