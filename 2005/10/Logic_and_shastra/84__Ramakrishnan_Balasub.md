There was an article in the Adyar Library Bulletin a while back where
S. Sankaranarayanan postulated that the sUtra bhAShya has been written
by multiple authors. But his arguments were not very sound, at least

Even the protogonists of the Kumbakonam Math consider that the Brahma Sutra Bhashya is by Adi Shankaracharya only, though they want to credit the former for Shanmata Stapana etc etc and perhaps even soundaryalahari (the paramacharya differs however).
