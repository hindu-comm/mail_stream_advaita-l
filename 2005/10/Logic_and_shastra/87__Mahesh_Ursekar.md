Pranams:
 Let me address your question first for which my contemplation has some
answers (if I have understood you right):
 >> Why should it change the onlooker's perspective of the realized.
 It doesn't really. But the reverse is not true. The realized person sees
the truth. This is akin to a person with sight (realized person) conversing
with a blind person (you or me). Or an adult conversing with a child.
 And that leads me back to my question. I can fully understand that one
cannot judge a realized person based on his or her interaction with a
another due to the above. However, what happens when the guru is alone. Both
my previous examples relate to such situations. Should they affected by
thoughts and feelings that we common people have? Taking another example of
Swami Vivekananda - he prayed to the mother once at Belur Math when
preparations were being made for the Durga Puja (I think) - 'Mother, please
give me a fever so that the next day, I will not have to supervise the monks
because if I do, I will burst into anger if I even see a little think faulty
with their work'. Naturally, being a perfectionist himself, this was to be
expected. But as a realized soul, not being able to control anger? How does
one explain that? Krodh, Moha, Lobh, .... are these not the things we are to
get rid off? Or Sri Ramakrishna yearing for disciples? Isn't that desire -
another thing one needs to be rid off on the path to realization?
 Humble pranams, Mahesh
