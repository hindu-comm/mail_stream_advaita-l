Dear Mr.Mahesh,

I think I can gain a lot from you.

I am sure you know science better than me. I read somewhere that the
total energy in the universe is same always. If what I read is correct,
then before a man dies he has some power or energy, if not one horse
power, say Â½ horse power (of course depends on the age). Now, as per
science, what happened to this power or energy of that person after he
dies?

Thanks
Solaikannan
