              || Aum Srimad Guru Charanaravindabhyam Namah ||

Dear Advaitins

It would be more pleasing to discuss considering the events that are the
evidence of the relative and the Absolute. For a Jiva, the laws of nature
work beyond his control but these laws are under the Control of an Atma or
Brahma Jnani or the Realized soul.

Looking for the best examples on both the relative and the Absolute.

always remembering Him. Then there will always be a smile on your face."
