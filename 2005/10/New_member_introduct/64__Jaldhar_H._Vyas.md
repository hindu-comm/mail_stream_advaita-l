My name is R.Mahesh and I am living in Netherlands. I have been doing
enquiry as taught by Bagawan Raman Maharishi for past few years.
I would not be able to participate in the scholarly discussions as a
contributor...but I hope the discussions trigger/ rekindle the passion of
enquiry every now and then , in me.
  Thanks,
Mahesh
