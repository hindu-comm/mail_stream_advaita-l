Namaste,
  My name is Bobby Baidjnath Misier and I am a student (34 years) in the
Netherlands.
I study Hindu texts and i'm very interested (for now) in the vedangas,
brahmanas and the advaita-vedanta.
I found your site with google and the level of knowledge made me join your
group, hoping that i can use your knowledge to define my own conclusions.
  With friendly regards,
Bobby
