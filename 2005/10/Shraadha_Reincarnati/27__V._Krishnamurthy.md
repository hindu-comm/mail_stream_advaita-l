Namaste

One more point hzas to be added to Shri Jaldhar's
exlanations in answer to  Krunal's question. This is in
respect of "When the soul has reincarnated into another
body, what is the purpose of offering something in the agni
to pitr's?". This also is implied in Krunal's questions.

It has to noted that when one offers something into the
agni, it does not go as it is to the pitr's. It goes in
that way which is most acceptable to them, if the mantras
are right. In other words, though the person has now been
born in a different birth in different circumstances and
environment, he gets on  that day what is to his liking. So
a pinDa offered here goes as the food that is tasty to him
in that birth; if he is an animal now, it goes as the food
that that animal likes. Every one has the experience of a
surprise pleasure in the form of an unexpected tasty food,
lunch or dinner -- perhaps this is the explanation for it!
