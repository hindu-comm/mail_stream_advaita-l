Dear Vishuji, 

Probably Yogavasishtha will serve your purpose. the
original book had 32,000 vereses. My own copy has
about 30,000  Sanskrit verses along with translation
to Hindi. Please see if you can get hold of a copy of
the same and manage to have time to go through that. 

Regards

S.K.Bhattacharjya
