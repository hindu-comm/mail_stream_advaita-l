I would say the Brahmasutras.  They take the vast variety of opinions that 
stem from the Upanishads and attempt to harmonize them into a logical 
system.

Look no further than one of the websites we host:  The Saradambal Seva 
Samiti Trust(http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/sarada/)  There you will find 
two interesting books to read, Brahmasutra Shankarabhashya Sangrah (a 
summary of Shankaracharyas' Brahmasutra bhashya ) and 
Advaitasiddhi Sara Sangrah (a summary of Swami Madhusudan Sarasvati's 
Advaitasiddhi)

Another work which you might find interesting is Vedantaparibhasha by 
Dharmaraja Adhvarindra.  It has been published by the Ramakrishna 
mission along with an English translation by Swami Madhavananda.

There are various histories of Sanskrit literature but nothing as far as I 
know which tries to tie everything together in a non-biased way.  (There 
are some which try to push a particular political agenda whether right or 
left.)  There is a pressing need for something like this.

>From Advaita Vedanta no.  Because as you said, it is only for moksha.  But 
Advaita Vedanta is part of the broader cultural framework known as 
Smartism and Smartas look to dharmashastras for guidance on worldly ethics.
