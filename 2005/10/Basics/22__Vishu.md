Hello folks,
Few questions:
1. What are the axioms that Advaita is built on?
2. Where can I find (books, websites) a fundamental treatise on Advaita? I
have read Eliot Deutsch and Swami Prabhavananda - summary of Advaita,
Bhagavadgita, Viveka-chudamani. They served their purpose. However, I'm
looking for something that takes axioms from scriptures (Smriti and/or
Shruti) and builds upon these axioms to make the case of Advaita.
3. There is a lot to Hinduism (Advaita being the most influential on the
philosophical side) - the philosophical side (dvaita, advaita,
vishista-advaita etc), the rituals, the itihasas, the puranas, astronomy,
astrology, ayurveda etc. At times, each branch has a clear message and yet
other times, one branch is applied to other blurring the lines. Is there a
work that lays out everything and puts them in context? -  a brief history
of everything and how one finds place in the other.
4. Is there a resource on morals and ethics derived from living the Advaita
way? I know this may be offensive to puritans. I apologize in advance. The
whole idea of applying Advaita to this dream state world may be sort of
anathema to Advaita, which transcends this virtual reality we are living in.
Nevertheless, while we are in this dreaming state of ours, we need to deal
with this virtual reality from stem cells to mars rovers. Is there a work
that arrives at a moral/ethical position derived from Advaita on some of the
seemingly controversial issues of our times? 

I appreciate your help!

Thank you,
Vishu
