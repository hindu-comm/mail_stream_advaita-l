I am posting this regarding Madhaveswari 
temple-prayaga. I have been to this temple in the last year.It is very well 
situated in prayaga (Sangamam of 3 rivers) which is nothing but Allahabad. 
The temple you may have to call as MATAJI ka temple (or LALITA ) 
probabably in the local language. Any auto or riksha fellow will take u from 
the station or whereever situated. We have beem there after seeing 
Ananda bhavan, hanuman temple. it will be covered in local site seeing. 
Since this temple is little away from the main road, you have to sepcify 
for this particualrly. But I am sure this is very nearer to Railway 
station. Evening aroung 7 pm there will be HARATI and it is very nice to 
see that. after this harati we reached the station in 15-20 min.

FOR any Relegious temples or places in India, any body are most well 
come to ask queries regarding all matters like how to go , where to stay, 
where to eat. I have been to most of the sacred places in india alone, 
some times with parents and some times with my Guru.
