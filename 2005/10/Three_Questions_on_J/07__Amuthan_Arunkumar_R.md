a small observation. brahma j~nAnam is NOT a mental
phenomenon. it is our svarUpa lakshaNam. a mere mental
knowledge that the Atman and the brahman are identical
is not sufficient for mukti. mind too is something
within avidyA. birth and death, bondage and liberation
etc. exist only in the mind which is a product of
avidyA. in reality none of these exist. a j~nAni does
not perceive anything as identical or non-identical,
as unity or as multiplicity. he just is.
