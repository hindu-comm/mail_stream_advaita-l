namaste vishu-ji,

> Your question No.2:
> The final realization (thou art that) is just knowledge. As
> soon as avidya is burnt by brahmanjnana one tends to
> perceive brahman in everything and everything in brahman â€“
> just a continuum. How can acquiring knowledge release one
> from cycle of births and deaths, for knowledge is purely
> mental and not a physical phenomenon?
>
> VK: Yes, Knowledge is a mental phenomenon, alright. Why do
> you think that mental activity will not have an influence
> on the physical plane? Don't you wake up from your dream
> because in the dream something shocking happened?
>
> Just to add to Prof VKji's points, when one gains the knowledge that he is
> brahman, the sense of "doership" is dissolved in the wake of this knowledge.
> All the karmas are burnt by the fire of knowledge -- hence a jnani will be
> freed from the cycle of births and deaths.

  hari om!
