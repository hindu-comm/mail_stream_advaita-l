At this time of year when we pray to Goddess Lakshmi for prosperity in the
coming year it is a good time one of the beautiful compositions of
Shankaracharya, kanakadhara stotra.  An English translation is available
here:

(Also check out some of the other stotras translated on that site.)

The story associated with this stotra reminds us that Dharma is the cause
of prosperity.  And dana is amongst the highest of Dharmas.
