H.H. Wilson in his introduction to the translation of the Vishnu
Purana notes that the "impure fancies" of Western writers has
resulted in the above conception of the Shiva Linga, and that such a
fanciful interpretation is nowhere to be found in any of the Shaiva
Puranas.

Do you have any traditional teachers (I would prefer prior to the
British invasion) who have suggested the above interpretation, or is
it based on speculation?

The word linga can also refer to a symbol or gender.

Thanks,

Kartik
