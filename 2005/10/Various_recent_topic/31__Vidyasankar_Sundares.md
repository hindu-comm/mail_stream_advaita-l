Hello all,

I have been very busy moving to a new city and starting at a new position, 
so I haven't been able to contribute to many recent discussions. I thought I 
would consolidate a bunch of responses in one mail, for convenience.

It would help to distinguish a general notion of advaita from advaita 
vedAnta. What makes vedAnta vedAnta is an adherence to some core principles 
- 1. the veda is the primary scriptural source, all else being subordinated 
at best as smRti, 2. a rigorous system of logical analysis based on the 
brahmasUtras, which in turn embody a system of interpretation of the veda, 
and 3. a tradition of saMnyAsa, embodied in the social structure. I know a 
number of people are immediately going to question the last one, but 
contrary to most modern sentiment, I give a high place to the tradition of 
ochre robe wearing saMnyAsins. You will find them even in non-advaita 
schools of vedAnta and they define the core of the tradition.

All other systems, which tend to or end in a non-dual goal (one school of 
Kashmir Saivism, some later schools of Buddhism, more modern movements, 
new-age or otherwise), can be categorized as advaita but definitely not as 
vedAnta.

This is more complex. A vedic statement like ahaM brahmAsmi is not 
efficacious because of a mAntric effect, it is the knowledge conveyed by the 
statement that is central to liberation. The question is, what is seen as 
the source of a statement like "Sivoham"? Is it considered to be derived 
from Vedic authority or to be independent of the vedas? If the former, there 
is room for considering the system another form of vedAnta; if the latter, 
it is not a system of vedAnta. It may or may not be advaita either. Many 
schools of Saivism interpret "Sivoham" in a bhedAbheda way, or in a ritual 
manner, without drawing a deeper non-dualistic meaning out of it.

Exactly. Any attempt to see the advaitic knowledge as mental activity is 
intrinsically flawed and itself informed by avidyA. Brahman is that which is 
unreachable by the mind or words (yato vAco nivartante aprApya manasA saha). 
An end to the cycle of births and deaths is reached only by going beyond the 
mind.

All questions about the need for SrAddha rituals in the context of 
reincarnation overlook two important issues.

First, who said that the departed person is reborn immediately in another 
physical body on earth? There might be thousands of years in between two 
physical earthly embodiments, or there might be less than a second. Everyone 
assumes it is the latter, not the former. The thing is, we do not know and 
we never really will. Doing SrAddha is firstly for the sake of defining the 
duty of the family members and secondly for the sake of the departed jIva.

Second, who said that the physical body is the same as the jIva? That a 
second physical body may have been set into motion does not take away the 
karmic link (karmabandha), otherwise called a debt (RNa, as Jaldhar pointed 
out) of the progeny to the dead person.

There is no contradiction between accepting reincarnation based on karma and 
the act of performing ritual SrAddha on death anniversaries.

SrAddha becomes irrelevant only when all karma is renounced. However, 
remember that reincarnation based on karma also ends when all karma is 
renounced.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
