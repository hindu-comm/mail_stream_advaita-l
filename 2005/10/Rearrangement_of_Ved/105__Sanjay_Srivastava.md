Kanchi mahA swaAmigal in his book on veads holds that veda is just one
and its subdivision into r^k etc. is indeed for our convenience. It
seems not only western scholars, but even the traditionalists also buy
the re-arrangement theory.

Also, the struggle between the proponents of trayi-vidyA on one side
and supporters of atharvaNa like bhr^gu and angiras on the other side,
is too well documented to ignore. If there were never any
rearrangements, how do we explain that many scholars at one time had
refused to accept atharva as part of veda?
