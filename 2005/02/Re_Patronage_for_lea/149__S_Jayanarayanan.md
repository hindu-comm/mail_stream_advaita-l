Maybe, but traditional shishhTas usually don't accept "help" in
the form of *money for nothing*, unless it is out of necessity
(there are exceptions like yAtrA-dAnaM, etc.). In the past,
traditional scholars used to teach students and give advice on
dharma to their patrons and others who sought it, and that was
their service in a dhArmic society. That's the reason that
BrAhmaNas are asked to perform vaidIka karma etc. -- everyone
has his/her duties in a dhArmic society, and serves the society
in that capacity. A BrAhmaNa who did not perform his alloted
work in a dhArmic society was not considered a BrAhmaNa at all,
as per the shAstras. There is very little need or demand for
scholars in mImAmsA (or VedAnta) in Indian society today,
because the practise of vaidIka dharma doesn't carry the weight
that it used to, so those who wish to pursue traditional
scholarship find few patrons.

I will try and find out more about the scholars who lack funding
and resources. The reason I remember the scholar whom I
mentioned in a previous posting so well is because I saw my
Guruji, who knows the entire KR^ishhNa Yajur Veda (including the
chanting, meaning, along with the various karmas involved), and
can speak and discourse fluently in Sanskrit, prostrate before a
man half his age, just because the man was more learned in Vedic
studies! It was a practical lesson that the tradition places far
greater weight on wisdom and learning than on physical age.
