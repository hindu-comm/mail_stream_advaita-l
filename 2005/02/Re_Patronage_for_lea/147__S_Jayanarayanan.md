Contrary to popular belief (even among Brahmins), the philosophy
of the Vedas is not limited to Vedic chanting! There are mImAmsA
and VedAnta sUtras which form the exegeses of the Vedas and
these texts require rigorous study. There are traditional
scholars who study these sUtras and it is these scholars that I
was referring to. They don't want to be full-time purohits since
that leaves no time for scholarship and study. It is these
scholars who are having a tough time in Modern India, finding
few patrons to support them.
