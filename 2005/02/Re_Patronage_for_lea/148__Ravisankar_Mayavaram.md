 Some of the organizations I mentioned do not teach only vedic
chanting. They teach a lot more than that. They will teach even more
and find teachers to teach them if there is a need/demand.  For
instance, veda paTha nidhi  has over 50 publications explaining many
vedic rituals, these books are not mere translations, they quote
relevant shaastra-s to  explain what is done, how it is done, and why
it is done.  And the vedagama trust in mayavaram, teach a lot from
shaivaagama-s etc.

I think, our goal must be  to find out what activities are going on
and make them known so that  willing people can help them and
participate in them.  You know someone , who is looking for funds to
study/teach mImAmsa etc. You can post in detail about them and the
importance in helping them out.  If you create that as a HTML file, I
will post it on ambaa.org as well.  This is one topic that requires
more action than discussion.

Thanks.

Ravi
