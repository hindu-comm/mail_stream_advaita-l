Well shloka 17 explicitly mentions param brahma nirdukhamasakham etc. It
is difficult to see how you could interpret that any other way.

I really don't understand why you persist in obfuscating a perfectly
simple concept.   Good deeds lead to the condition in which jnana occurs.
This is Vedanta 101.  Yudhisthira only mentions Brahmana-G at the
beginning to show that being a Brahmana-K is not an end to itself but is a
preparatory stage for being a Brahmana-G.  Again this is not anything that
Shankaracharya hasn't said a million times over.

For being a professor the requirement is a Ph.D not a high school diploma.
So people without high school diplomas can also be professors.  Do you see how
absurd such reasoning is?  Birth is one of the particular requirements for
upanayana samskara  and therefore initiation into the Gayatri mantra.
Conduct in part depends on birth.  But there is some manner of good
conduct for everyone, even a giant talking snake.

Yeah a condescending and patronizing attitude like forget everything you
inherited and copy the Brahmanas is really going to increase anyones
self-esteem.
