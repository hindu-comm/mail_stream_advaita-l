Why stop at humans?  Genetics research often uses the nematode (a species
of worm) because its genes are largely the same as humans.  So a human
should be considered equal to a worm?

Those who think science can solve "arbitrary" human conditions are in for
a disappointment because all science can do is show a vast new range of
arbitrary conditions.

I believe we discussed on the list a long time ago that this likely to be
a fake.  Just because a work has upanishad in the title doesn't make it
one!

I believe we looked at that one too.

Apart from the utter lack of historical evidence, another factor that
militates against the guna theory is the numerous examples of bad
Brahmanas in the shastras.  Ashvatthama for instance slaughtered the
children of the Pandavas out of revenge.  Yet he avoided the death
penalty because the Pandavas respected him as a Brahmana.  (He was the
son of Drona.) How do you justify killing children by guna and karma?
