Namaste Bhaskarji,

Please take note that I have mentioned that Shankara RE-INTERPRETS the angas in the Aparokshaanubhuti. Please do study the text and you will definitely get what I mean. 

All sadhanas in Patanjala Yoga can be classified as Purusha tantra while manana & Nididhyasana are vastu tantras. Hence the re-interpretation by Shankara in Aparokshaanubhuti seems to be of the latter type.

Namaste

praNAm Sri Kathirasan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Kathirasan prabhuji:

Aparokshanubhuti is an interesting text. Shankara(?) re-interprets the 8 limbed Yoga with an additional 7 limbs. Altogether you will find 15 limbs in the Yoga of Aparokshaanubhuti. But this Yoga is not Patanjala Yoga. It is more of Mananam & Nididhyasana.

bhaskar :

Could it be possible for you to elaborate the above observation prabhuji..in what way patanajali's ashtAnga yoga especially the last three fold sAdhana-s i.e. dhAraNa, dhyAna & samAdhi differs from shankara's shravaNa, manana & nidhidhyAsana...My parama guruji deals with this issue in bruhadAraNyaka bhAshya..just I'd like to have others' opinion also on this.

Kathirasan prabhuji:

I guess the word RajaYoga is to eulogize this re-interpretation by Shankara. And then he recommends Karma (hatha yoga) for those not being able to appreciate this (anadhikaris).

Good question about Vedanta Sara. I did mention in the other Advaitin list the misleading nature of this 'traditional' text. He prescribes Patanjala Yoga after shravana, manana & nididhyasana for the attainment of Samadhi.

bhaskar :

I believe there is definitely a place for yOga in advaita as an antaranga sAdhana & for krama mukti..But vEda vihita nidhidhyAsana cannot be compared with patanjali's dhyAna yOga & resultant asaMprajnaTha samAdhi...vArtikakAra Sri sureshwara says that nidhidhyAsana & shruti vAkya anusaNdhAna should be done after attaining mental purification through yOgic practices...So, we can say patanjali's samAdhi yOga is not a *must* in realising paramArtha jnAna...Nevertheless, it is evident that some prakaraNa grantha-s in the name of shankara advocating that nirvikalpa samAdhi is a must & direct as well as practical path to attain advitIya paramArtha jnAna.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
