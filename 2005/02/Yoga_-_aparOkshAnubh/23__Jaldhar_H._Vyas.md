Aparokshanubhuti is traditionally regarded as a composition of
Shankaracharya.  There is a commentary Dipika by Swami Vidyaranya and
other illustrious Advaitin acharyas have also commented on it or quoted
from it.  However some modern historians question the genuineness of this
work in part precisely because it is replete with yogic references.

Patanjali didn't call his system Rajayoga and Vivekanandas' neat division
of "yogas" is bogus but it is a stretch to say he invented the term.

As K. Kathirasan says, while it is replete with yogic ideas, the
aparokshanubhuti uses them to Advaita Vedantic ends.  So there is
no conflict there.

We have discussed in the past that the classical Samkhya/Yoga system was
gradually absorbed and "Vedantized"
