Hare Krishna

As regards to yOga in advaita & patanjali's yOga sUtra's influence in
shankara bhAshya, my cybernet guruji Sri Vidyashankara Sundareshan prabhuji
( Chief Moderator of this group) has written a masterful article...I dont
know whether it is available in the filing section...In this article he has
shown ample evidences that there is patanjali's  yOga system closely
knitted in shankara philosophy....With his permission, I took the main
purport of this article & briefed my guruji Sri Avadhani who is direct
desciple of my parama guruji Sri Satchidanandendra saraswati of
H.N.pur....He said there is indeed a place for yOga in shankara philosophy
not as a direct means to shrutyanugrahIta paramArtha jnAna but as an
antaranga sAdhana...Moreover, he has given some references from shruti-s,
kArika's asparsha yOga, shankara bhAshya & sureshwara's vArtika &
naishkarmya siddhi which clarifies shankara's stand on dhAraNa, dhyAna &
samAdhi as against patanjali's ashtAnga yOga....

I humbly request Sri Vidyashankar prabhuji to intervene & clarify his
stand.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
