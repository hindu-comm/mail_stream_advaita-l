In reply to this post Sri Stig mentioned - "However,
there is a view among scholars that Shankara is the
author only of the 
first
101 slokas, while the rest of the slokas (102-144)
where authored by 
someone
else at a later stage. As far as I understand, this
view was shared 
also by
Satchidanandendra Swamiji."

Jaldhar:  would you please comment if Dipika has
commentary on slokas 102 to 144, and similaly did the
other traditional teachers/quthors quote from slokas
102 to 144 ?

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
