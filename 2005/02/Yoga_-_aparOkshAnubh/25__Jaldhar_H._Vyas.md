Dipika is the only commentary I have handy.  It covers all 144 shlokas.
However it must be said that the yogic material is only in shlokas
102-144.  The prior shlokas expound an entirely standard account of
Advaita Vedantic sadhana.  So while not provable, it is plausible that
the latter shlokas were added by someone after Shankaracharya.  (But
before Swami Vidyaranya.)
