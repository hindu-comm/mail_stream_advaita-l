 Dear Sri Srikrishna Ghadiyaram,

My guruji pandit K.G. Subraya Sharma recently told me that his guru (in
other words my paramaguruji) Holenarsipur Swami Satchidanandendra Saraswati
considered aparOkshAnubhUti a genuine work of Adi ShankaraÂ´s pen. However,
there is a view among scholars that Shankara is the author only of the first
101 slokas, while the rest of the slokas (102-144) where authored by someone
else at a later stage. As far as I understand, this view was shared also by
Satchidanandendra Swamiji.


Warmest regards
Stig Lundgren
