hariH Om !

I think it is more meaningful not to have individual's
names in the subject line of posts. If the post is
primarily addressed to an individual, it may be
mentioned in the body of the mail.

People look for the subject line to know what one is
talking about, and having individual names in the
subject line does not help in any way to the general
reader.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
