Dear Krishamurty ji,

>>>>>>>>>>>>Brahma lokam abhisampadyathe is to be costrued as -he reaches
the world of Brahman and not the world of Brahma.

What is the clear difference between both? There doesn't seem to be any
proof of such difference. There is only one term "Brahman". Brahma is just
the singular form of the first tense of Brahman. So, there doesn't seem to
be any proof of the existence of two types of BrahmaLokas. The only
logical meaning that I can get out of the term is "the state of Brahman".
That there should be a place belonging to Brahmaa, where he has fun and
enjoys life with his followers, a greater form of heaven, is not at all
understandable in modern times. No such loka has even been mentioned in
any of the Vedic scriptures, only in the Puranas.
Love,
Siddhartha Krishna
