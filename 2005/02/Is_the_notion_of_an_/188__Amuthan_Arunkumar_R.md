please explain in detail the change of perspective and
the flaw in the arguments presented.

i'm not arguing against the nature of brahman. a
viSishtAdvaitin may put forth his theory and say the
nature of brahman is such and such and so can a
dvaitin. but this is just a statement of one's faith,
it does not answer anything.

i don't understand how this explains anything at all.
