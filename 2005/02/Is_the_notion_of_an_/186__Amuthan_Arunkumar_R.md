what do you mean by a "lower order of reality". to
whom does it exist?

if the analogy is properly extended, what you've
mentioned is true for a sAdhaka who has *still not
realised the truth*, but has heard about it from his
guru. 

but does this hold for a jN.Ani? i again refer to the
commentary of SrI rAmAnujAcArya (see my previous mail)
where this view i.e. the simultaneous knowledge of
brahman and mAyA (as is understood in advaita), is
refuted.

the key question is not how a jN.Ani perceives the
world, but rather, in the first place, how can the
existence of a *world* be justified for a jN.Ani
according to advaita?

to put it in another way, what is the advaitin's
defence against SrI rAmAnujAcArya's criticism of
advaita in this context? (see my previous mail, where
i've provided a few references)
