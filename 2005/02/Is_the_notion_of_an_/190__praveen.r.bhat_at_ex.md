Jaldharji:
I think the problem is maya often gets translated as illusion which
suggests it doesn't really exist when it is more correct to say it is a
lower order of reality.

praveen:
May I also humbly add that a beginner's book "What is Advaita?" 
by P Sankaranarayan neatly explains that translating mAyA as illusion
is inappropriate and the author also explains why.

jai bajrangabali,
