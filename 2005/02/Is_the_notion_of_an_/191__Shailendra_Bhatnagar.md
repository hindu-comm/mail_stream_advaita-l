Namaste Amuthanji, My little understanding of Advaita is that Ishvar or Saguna Brahman is part of Maya. The only absolute reality is the Nirguna Brahman. Having said that, I am equally perplexed by the notion of Prakruti or Maya shakti. Whose power is this ? Brahman's ? Can Brahman be (satyam, jnanam, anantam) and (rajas, tamas and sattva) at the same time ? This basic contradiction is probably reconciled in the Brahm Sutra bhasya but I have not personally read it. The more well read and learned members can comment on it.

regards,
Shailendra

presented below, i'm not trying to refute the
existence of an ISvara, but rather asking for a
rational justification of it based on the axioms of
advaita vedanta.
