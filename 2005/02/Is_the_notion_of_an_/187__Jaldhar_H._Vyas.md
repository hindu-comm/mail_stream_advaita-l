To the person who believes it exists.

But has he grasped all the implications?  Indra and Virochana both heard
the Brahmavidya from Prajapati.  But Virochana completely missed the
point.  Even if one has a library of a billion Vedantic books it will be
for naught if one isn't spiritually ready.

As I said before, the difference is in perspective.  You cannot use the
same measure when the very definition has changed.  This is the basic
methodological flaw in the Vaishnava arguments.

An example given in the Yogavasishtha is of the foam in the waves.  It is
the very nature of the waves and their turbulence that makes the foam
appear, stay for a while and then dissipate.  It is Brahmans nature that
words are created, stay for a while and are destroyed.  Why is it that way
and not some other way?  I don't know but that's the way it is.

Extending the analogy further, it is only up close that one observes the
turbulence in the waves.  From space (i.e. a different perspective,) the
ocean appears totally flat.
