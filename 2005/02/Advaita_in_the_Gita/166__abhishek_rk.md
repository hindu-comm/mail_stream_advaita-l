Namaste,
These verses spoken by Shri Krishna in the Gita
clearly are advaitic in nature:

ahamAtma guDAkeSa 
sarva-bhutAsaya-sthitah 
aham Adis ca madhyam ca 
bhutAnam anta eva ca (10.20)

kSetrajnam cApi mAm viddhi 
sarva-kSetreSu bhArata 
kSetra-kSetrajnayor jnAnam 
yat taj jnAnam matam mama(13.3)

As well as many other verses show that Bhagvan Sri
Krishna has taught the advaitic doctrine of
brahma-vAda in the Gita. Any comments/ additions by
the members is most welcome.

Abhishek
