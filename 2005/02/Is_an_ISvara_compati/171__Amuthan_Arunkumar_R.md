that a sublated knowledge of the "world" will exist
for a jN.Ani is precisely the point questioned.

the above analogy does not apply here. the reasons why
it is not applicable is clearly mentioned by SrI
rAmAnujAcArya. i've mentioned the criticism of the
above argument by SrI rAmAnujAcArya in my previous
mail. 

essentially, it reduces to the following question :
what exactly is bAdhita jN.Ana?

hari sarvatra,
aparyAptAmr.ta
