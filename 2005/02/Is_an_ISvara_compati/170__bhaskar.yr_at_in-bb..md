a closely related question is : how can a
world exist at all for a jN.Ani?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

jnAni's vyavahAra will be with a sublated (bhAdita jnAna)  knowledge of
world!!  It does not anyway mean after the dawn of knowledge world should
disappear in a thin air... Dont we see the *blue sky* even after realising
blueness actually does not belong to sky??  It is all about *avagati* not
prapancha laya per se...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
