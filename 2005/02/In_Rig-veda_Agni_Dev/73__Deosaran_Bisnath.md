Respected Sirs Ji's,
Pranams to you all.
Many thanks for such scholarly stuff.
I look forward to your contributions as 
I wend my way towards greater knowledge and 
advancement.
If I may humbly inform, there seems to be 
repetition of messages, and as you know 
too much of a good thing is not advisable.

Dhanyvaad
