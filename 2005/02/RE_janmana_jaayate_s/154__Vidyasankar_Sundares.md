The judiciary also examines whether a law passed by the legislature is ultra 
vires to the constitution and throws the law out if it is.

But that is a personal choce of the one who eats, and it is not the 
judiciary's job to enforce the traditional rules about forbidden foods. Even

the local community, through social ostracism, not by running to a king or 
judge.
