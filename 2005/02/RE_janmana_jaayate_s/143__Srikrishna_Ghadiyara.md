I take that, you have answered my main question  which
is whether a SUdra can undergo upanayana and Vedic
studies, as 'YES'. Would you please answer the other
part i.e will such a SUdra be able to do all the nitya
and naimittika karmas just like brAhmanas. 

I am asking these questions because if it is allowed
by all communities to live like a brAhmana, if they
choose,  interms of samskaras and duties then there
should not be any moe complaints. I also know that
once such provision is made available they will not
demand for it, as we see that even brAhmaNas do not do
this unremunirative job any more. Current society has
more attractive things to offer. But, it will quieten
the society. Let a serious brAhmana or other practice
the vedic karma/dharma, as they wish. If the society
allows such activities for all it is likely to remove
unnecessary social divide, as it is perceived now,
though there may not be such a divide in reality.

All the complaints against brAhmanas are not based on
the eligibility for Vedic study etc. It is all
because, once upon a time those roles had more
importance in the society. Mostly it is the problem of
the upper castes not treating all people with due
respect, and arrogating more resources for themselves.
Now that we are in path for a new social order, this
debate about eligibility will be a moot point.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
