Excuse me for my interference sir, but I would like to bring to your attention, the following -

http://members.ozemail.com.au/~mooncharts/manu/manu-bilingual-2.pdf

This is from Manusmriti -

8.417. A Brahmana may confidently seize the goods of (his) Sudra (slave); for, as that (slave) can have no property, his master may take his possessions.

8.416. A wife, a son, and a slave, these three are declared to have no property; the wealth which they earn is (acquired) for him to whom they belong.

11.11. If a sacrifice, (offered) by (any twice-born) sacrificer, (and) especially by a Brahmana, must remain incomplete through (the want of) one requisite, while a righteous king rules........


11.12. That article (required) for the completion of the sacrifice, may be taken (forcibly) from the house of any Vaisya, who possesses a large number of cattle, (but) neither performs the (minor) sacrifices nor drinks the Soma-juice;


11.13. (Or) the (sacrificer) may take at his pleasure two or three (articles required for a sacrifice) from the house of a Sudra; for a Sudra has no business with sacrifices.


9.149. If there be four wives of a Brahmana in the direct order of the castes, the rule for the division (of the estate) among the sons born of them is as follows:

skipping 9.150

9.151. Let the son of the Brahmana (wife) take three shares of the (remainder of the) estate, the son of the Kshatriya two, the son of the Vaisya a share and a half, and the son of the Sudra may take one share.


9.154. Whether (a Brahmana) have sons or have no sons (by wives of the twice-born castes), the (heir)must, according to the law, give to the son of a Sudra (wife) no more than a tenth (part of his estate).


There are more such examples. Might I then ask you to reconsider your opinion?
