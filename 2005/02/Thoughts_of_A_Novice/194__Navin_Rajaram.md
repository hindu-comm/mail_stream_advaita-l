Jaldharji, in the context of the present discussion, what is gained by 
discriminating between a shudra and non shudra? To extend Girish's 
reasoning a little further, are we not going deeper into 
dichotomies(two_ness) and/or holding on to one of the sides of these 
dichotomies while the aim is to transcend these very dichotomies?

Agreed that it is necessary to discriminate, but if transcending was the 
ultimate goal, how are we to judge who is what and is judgement 
necessary at all in the event of the purpose being to even transcend 
buddhi that leads to this judgement?

Hair Om,
Navin
