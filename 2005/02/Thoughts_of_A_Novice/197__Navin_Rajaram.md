Yes, I meant to come to this question. If a shudra were to be considered 
a shudra - first by birth - then is following his svAdharma which as per 
the varna system is serving the rest of society - his only way to attain 
moksha.
For example, my ancestors were priests. In this age and time, I am an 
engineer who works fulltime, while I manage to devote a small fraction 
of time to the study of shastras - something which my ancestors did full 
time. Similarly, if an individual were to find his lineage traces back 
to the shudra varna, yet he finds himself motivated to study the 
shastras by virtue of being a Hindu - what should be his course of action?

On a side note, is being born a shudra a consequence of past karmas? I 
do not know. But, if a shudra does indeed follow one's svAdharma (as 
defined by the varna system), then is that also a possible way of 
reaching the same self-realization a Brahmin seeks by performing 
karmas,tapas and sadhana?

Dichotomies do exist. In fact there are more than just dichotomies. My 
question was should we get caught in them. It will be unreasonable for 
us to run away to the forests, simply because our karmas bind.

But, maybe what you are saying is that action entails discrimination, 
which again means we need to have a picture of right and wrong. Maybe in 
the process of acting again and again with discrimination, we'll reach 
the stage where none of our actions will matter or the fact that we are 
not acting shall become clear.

In the advaitic sense, I agree with Girishji in the vision that we ought 
to quit discrimination when we talk of mortals. That kind of vision 
cannot happen overnight, but if we were to discriminate like you say, 
would it not  make the process of acquiring that vision even more 
difficult?

Agreed. So when we say shudras should be following their svAdharma, 
while let a Brahmin do his, a Ksatriya do his - that is the best 
recourse possible for each of these individuals to attain the Source. 
Ideally,yes but I still feel the present social order and time has 
changed things - we are all fulfilling multiple roles, governed by our 
need to survive. Where then does following the old system perfectly come 
in?


Hari Om,
Navin
