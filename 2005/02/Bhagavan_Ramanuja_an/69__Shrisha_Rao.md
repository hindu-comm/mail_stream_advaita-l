I'm afraid the scholarship of your sources leaves a great deal to be
desired.  You are doing a disservice to North India by extrapolating their
incompetence all over it.

There are commentaries on all ten principal Upanishads from Madhva (who
has also written separate commentaries on the Mahabharata, the Rg Veda,
the Bhagavata Purana, besides the works you mentioned -- a uniquely large
swath).  All his works are very much available; in fact, you can find some
of them at http://www.dvaita.net among other places.

Again, the scholarship leaves a lot to be desired...
