hariH Om !!

Would the members provide me an e-mail or postal
address contact for University of Madras press which
prints the philosophy books. I do  not find any
information on the web. What is the way to obtain the
books they have printed and how to obtain them.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
