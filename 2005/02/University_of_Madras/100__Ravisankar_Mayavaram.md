 Giri Trading agency in Madras carries a lot of religious/philosophy
books. They carry books from different publishers and ship books to
countries outside India.  It is a very famous store among aastika-s in
Chennai.

Their online catalogue is incomplete. You can e-mail them with the
book details and enquire whether they will get the book and ship it.
>From what the employee at the shop told me that just charge actual  
book price and S&H (actual) and convert it to USD.

I have not ordered books from them  via internet.
