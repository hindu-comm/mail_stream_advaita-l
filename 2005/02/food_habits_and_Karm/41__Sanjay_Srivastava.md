And why would he not feel the same sentiments while eating a vegetable - say 
a potato? I would like to quote from "The Prophet" on dinking and eating:

"Would that you could live on the fragerance of the earth, and like an air 
plant be sustained by the light.
But since you must kill to eat, and rob the young of its mother's milk to 
quench your thirst, let it then be an act of worship,
And let your board stand an altar on which the pure and the innocent of 
forest and plain are sacrificed for that which is purer and still more 
innocent in many.
When you kill a beast say to him in your heart,
By the same power that slays you, I too am slain; and I too shall be 
consumed.
For the law that delivered you into my hand shall deliver me into a mightier 
hand"
