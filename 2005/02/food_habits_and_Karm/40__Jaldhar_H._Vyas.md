But might the resolve of the repulsed waver if they are confronted with a
beautifully arranged, nice smelling piece of flesh?  As a matter of
strategy I like the way Shri Parasukhanandanatha put it.  "Leaving the
small family to join the large family"  An advaitin would find the idea of
eating an animal as strange as taking a bite from his own mother.

Yes, I think the high percentage of vegetarians in all sections of
Gujarati society for instance is due to the Jain influence that continues
till today.  But its strange that classical authors don't mention them as
much as Buddhists in this context.  Mind you Bengal was the last
stronghold of Buddhism in India and Jainism was not so well known so
perhaps Vishvanatha conflated the two in his mind.

Well Hindu is just a catch-all term.  It means "people who live on the
right bank of the Indus" nothing more.

Unfortunately in modern times, science and rationality have gotten
confused together.  Science is the application of rationality to
observable phenomena.  This does not mean any other subject cannot be
rational.
