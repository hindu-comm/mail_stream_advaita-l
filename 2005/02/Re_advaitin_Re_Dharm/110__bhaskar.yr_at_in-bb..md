Humble praNAms to all prabhuji-s who are responded to this thread
Hare Krishna

Thanks a lot for taking your precious time & clarifying my doubts on
*dharmAcharaNa* & its universal applicability....Though prabhuji-s varied
slightly in their opinion, the crux of the teaching I got says that main
purpose of dharma shAstra-s is to discipline & regulate our life style to
pursue the path of realisation....the provision of flexibility  in dharma
shastra-s should not set a precedence to its followers  who wants to
contravene the injuctions on a regular basis.

Thanks onceagain for the informative contrtibution on this thread.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
