Dear Sri Parasukhanandanadhaji,

You Wrote :

During my upanayanam, Gayatri matra was recited by my
Guru in my ears and heard from the elders this is the
sampradaya in our sect (Smartha). My father did not
entrust me the matra as you wrote.

Probably, certian sects may follow as what you have commented. Can I know
from the learned readers
in the list as which is the correct way of initaiting the Gayatri mantra.
