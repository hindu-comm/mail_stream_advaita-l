The laws of any democratic nation are framed by the Legislature
-- based on voting.

The constitution of a democratic nation can be amended -- again
by voting.

The judiciary merely ensures that the laws are interpreted in
the right manner. In other words, the judiciary passes its
ruling based on the laws that have already been framed by the
majority opinion.

Therefore, the apt parallel to the dharma shAstras in today's
India is Legislative Law --

Judiciary System : rAjA :: Legislative Law : dharma shAstras

For example, the law permitting meat-eating at restaurants is
based on vote. Even though it may be *unethical* for a Brahmin
who is versed in the Vedas to eat unconsecrated meat, no judge
in any modern Indian court can enforce such a rule. The
judiciary cannot operate independent of the "Law passed by
vote", so the judges are also really only protecting the
majority opinion in their decisions.

Hence my statement: "the majority opinion will *always* overrule
the shAstra."
