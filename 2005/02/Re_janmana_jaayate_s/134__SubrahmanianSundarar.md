Dear SriKrishna:

I just wanted to highlight the fact that the statement should not be taken literally.  

In the process, I ended up adding a few sentences that might have caused confusion.  I am not well informed about Smritis and their prescriptions.  In such matters, I will be very happy to follow elders and wise men in the socieity.

SVS
