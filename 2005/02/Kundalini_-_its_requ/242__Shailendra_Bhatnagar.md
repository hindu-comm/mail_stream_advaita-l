Hari OM,  My question is more out of ignorance than conviction. One of the fundamental principles of Advaita is that we are not BMI(body, mind, intellect). What can be the potential of this jad deh ? The real consciousness or life principle is Atman and Atman is not dependent on material elements or material energies, is it ? Why dissect this jad deh and look for an energy potential in this ? 

thanks,
Shailendra
