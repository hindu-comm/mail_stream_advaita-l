Namaste.
According to upanishads, there are 6 chakras, present on the astral body of every person. The awakening of kundalini will pass through all these chakras via sushumna nadi. When kundalini reaches the crown of the head, then that person is said to have accomplished self-realization (Jeevan mukta - JM), and then achieves immediate salvation. In this case, the soul of JM, after the death of physical body, won't go to any lokas or halt anywhere, but becomes inifinite (omnipresent - Gita 2/24), and thus called divine. 

It is said that no salvation is possible without awkening of kundalini. In that case, how is it possible for those souls that follow 8/24 path (Dev yan marg) of Gita (or Upanishads) and waiting at Brahma Lok, to get the kundalini awakened for the sake of achieving salvation? Can we say that awakening of kundalini is also prior requirement even for those souls which follow 8/24 path? 

I will be grateful for your answers on this.

Namaste
