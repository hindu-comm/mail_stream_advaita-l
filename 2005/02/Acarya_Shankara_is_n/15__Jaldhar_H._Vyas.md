My mistake, yes it is.

And in fact they can be used against the Muktikopanishad itself.  I think
it too is mostly likely spurious.  The reason I mentioned it is because
the muktikopanishad atleast concerns itself with enumerating upanishads.
Regardless of whether it is real or fake, it is an attempt by atleast one
section of the tradition to map out the Vedic canon.  But we can find
other ways to do it too.  For instance did Upanishadbrahmayogi comment on
Vajrasuchika? It is these little tidbits put together which can enable us
to make a determination.  Yes, in the end its all guesswork but there is a
difference between an educated guess and a shot in the dark.

For that matter kalisantarana "upanishad" teaches the Harekrishna mantra
as the means to moksha.  Other texts are also blatently sectarian.  Are
they authoritative?

Ok, so what Shakha does Vajrasuchika belong to?  (No, "Samaveda" isn't a
shakha.)

The classical upanishads are mostly uniform in teaching.  They share the
same worldview and concepts atleast.  But vajrasuchika and kalisantarana
or to use another notorious example allah upanishad obviously do not.
Then there are a whole range where the boundary is a lot fuzzier.

Ok that just transfers the test of authenticity from the text to the
teaching.  You still can't claim authority for a work just because it has
upanishad in the title.
