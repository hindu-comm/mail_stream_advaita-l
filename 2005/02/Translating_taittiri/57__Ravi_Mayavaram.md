A) Are they any existing translations? If yes, are they good?

B) If not, are there resources in India who will translate it for a fee 
  and so that it can be made available on the Web.

A contact I know was interested in funding this effort and he was 
contacted by someone from India charging Rs. 50,000/month and at least 
three months of work. I feel it is rip off. Plus, one has to verify the 
qualifications of whoever claims to translate.

My suggestion was to get in touch R.K. Math and work with one of the 
Swamiji's to execute the work. R.K. Mission would like to publish it. If 
they do that then, it is indeed a big win-win.


Any suggestions in this regards would be welcome. Please send your 
response by private mail to me, unless you what you have to say will 
benefit members at large.

Thanks in advance.


Ravi
