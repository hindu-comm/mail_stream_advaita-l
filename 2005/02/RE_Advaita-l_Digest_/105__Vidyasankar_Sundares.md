Personally, I would say upanayana is a prerequisite for learning to chant 
the veda, because that would be a sign of respecting the tradition. However, 
also personally, for people who show interest and sincerity, I would not 
restrict upanayana according to birth. I realize there will always be 
differences of opinion on this matter, depending on one's conviction. Gender 
is a little more complicated in this regard, primarily because of issues of 
ritual purity at the physical level.

Well yes, but they operate independently of Sringeri Matha, do they not? 
Like so many other institutions, including other famous Mathas ... Although 
the initiatory lineage can be traced back, their activities and leadership 
do not reflect upon what a traditional authority would accept.
