Yes, out of the total of 7 mantras, 5 *directly* praise agni,
while the last refers to Indra.

ONLY (and this cannot be emphasized more) the second mantra
refers to "durgAM devIM". There is hardly any "tilting" in favor
of the devI for the entire sUktam.h.

It is a stretch of the imagination to take the entire sUktam.h
as adoring the devI, when 6/7 verses -- a whopping 85% of the
mantras are praising agni and Indra!

Perhaps, but the primary deity of any sUktram.h is made clear by
the sheer number of the mantras in the sUktam.h praising that
deity. Take for instance the vishhNu sUktam.h or purushha
sUktam.h.

If someone wishes to adore the devI with this sUktam.h, that is
fine, but it is not very convincing that this sUktam.h is
primarily to the devI for that reason!

At Sabarimalai, verses from the Veda praising the "shAsta" are
recited to ayyappan. It so happens that the verses are referring
to the king, calling him "shAsta". The priests chose these
verses because the word "shAsta" is commonly used to refer to
ayyappan, but there really are no verses in the Vedas devoted to
ayyappan. But if you ask a devotee there, they will insisit that
references to ayyappan are found throughout the Vedas :-)
