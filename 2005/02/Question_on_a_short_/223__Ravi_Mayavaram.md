The book I have on vaishvedevam  has a set of 72 mantra-s known as 
simhaavalokana mantra-s and it explains the procedure of doing the same. 
The mantra starts with "simhe me manyuH". In that also occurs "shuke me 
harimaa" and harimaa is translated as jaundice (Tamil ma~njal 
kaamaalai). From my cursory reading, bad traits and proneness to certain 
  diseases are transferred to other beings which can handle it better. 
These are not always animals, certain traits are transferred to 
xatriya-s, vaishya-s, etc. To give some examples, thirst is transferred 
to Camel, hunger to wolf, tooth ailments to rats, etc.

Author refers to bodhayana 4-7-7 for doing this procedure. Probably from 
what you write, all have a vedic basis too. This simhaavalokana is done 
(optional though) daily after gaNa homam. It can be done even if one 
does not not vaishvedevam. But has to be learnt from a guru. I have not 
read this book completely yet and it is published by Mylapore Veda 
Adhyayana Sabha.
