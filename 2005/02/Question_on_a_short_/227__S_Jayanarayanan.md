My Guruji was of the opinion that the sUrya namaskAra mantra was
not a prayer to sUrya per se, just as the durgA sUktam.h was
primarily to agni not to durgA per se.

I've always been meaning to ask him why he thought this was so
and who the primary deity of the sUrya namaskAra mantra was, and
will try and get the answer soon.
