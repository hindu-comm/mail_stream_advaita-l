Subject: Re: Please Send Your Introduction


Dear All,
Namaste and Greetings.
Introductions are difficult as they embody a sense of
accomplishments. What introduction can one give in
comparison to the lofty personality of Shankara!
Nonetheless, here is my humble introduction. I am an
ardent seeker on his spiritual trek. The philosophy of
Shankara, esp. his Saundarya Lahiri is my subject of
interest. Also am studying the texts of Kashmir
Shaivism. The advaita philosophy seems to resonate
with my mental inclinations and liking. Possibly some
impressions from my past birth.
I wish to learn from you all and reinforce my
understanding through healthy dialog.

Regards,
-Dinesh (Epsi)
