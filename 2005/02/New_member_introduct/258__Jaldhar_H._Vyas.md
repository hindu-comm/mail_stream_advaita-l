Name: Mahesh Ursekar
Age: 41
Country: India
Interest:
I am an avid devotee of Sri Ramakrisha/Swami Vivekananda and have a
deep interest in Advaitic thought. In my opinon, Sankara's exposition
of the Upanishads is most elegant and satisfying when compared to
other divergent views such as those of Ramanuja or Madhva.
