praNAM,

I'd mentioned this book on another thread; here it is again:

What is Advaita? 
by P. Sankaranarayanan
Bhavan's publication

The author explains this 3-fold logical system of advaita with 
quite a few examples, though he may have coined the terminology 
*not real* himself, between real & unreal.

Hope you find it useful.

jai bajrangabali,

namo nArAyaNAya

I cannot think of a single book that clearly explains this!

But try "A Thousand Teachings: The Upadesasahasri of Sankara" by
Sengaku Mayeda, for a good introduction to Shankaran advaita
vedAnta. There is a lot this book has to say regarding the
treatment of avidyA in the tradition.
