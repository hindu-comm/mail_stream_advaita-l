namo nArAyaNAya

I cannot think of a single book that clearly explains this!

But try "A Thousand Teachings: The Upadesasahasri of Sankara" by
Sengaku Mayeda, for a good introduction to Shankaran advaita
vedAnta. There is a lot this book has to say regarding the
treatment of avidyA in the tradition.
