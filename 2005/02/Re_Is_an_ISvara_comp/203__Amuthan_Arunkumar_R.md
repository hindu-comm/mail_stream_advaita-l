Dear SrI rAmakr.shNan bAlasubramanian,

before anything else, let me clear a small
misunderstanding : i'm not trying to refute advaita.
neither am i supporting viSishTAdvaita. i was just
asking for proper explanation of some questions which
sounded very tough to answer (for me).

as far as i can understand, ISvara exists only in the
vyAvahArika state. the above argument of urs suggests
to me that an ISvara has no place in advaita. if i can
rephrase my original question, what is the notion of
an ISvara according to advaita? my understanding goes
as follows : during the state of vyAvahArika, ISvara,
jIva and jagat are relatively eternal. in the
pAramArthika state, all duality is transcended and
only brahman exists. 

given this, and the fact that ISvara is a sarvajN.a,
the natural conclusion that He must know both brahman
(His svarUpam) and mAyA seems to go against advaita.

presently, i'm neither a viSishTAdvaitin nor an
advaitin, though i "believe" that the upanishads can
furnish me all that i require to know; as i mentioned
earlier, i'm looking for solutions to some questions
that i found difficult to address myself.

i've not read any book like "advaita and
vishistadvaita: a comparative approach". i haven't
read upadeSa sAhasri fully either. but based on
whatever i've read and listened about advaita, to my
knowledge, i haven't come across any proper
explanation to the question raised. 

as a minor note, if my tone was combative, please
forgive me. it was not intentional. 

hari sarvatra,
aparyAptAmr.ta
