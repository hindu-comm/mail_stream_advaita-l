namo nArAyaNAya

dear SrI Stig Lundgren,

before replying to your answer, i'd like to point out
that while a theory of karma is atleast a possible
solution to the question raised, for a jN.Ani as
you've mentioned, the same doesn't hold true for
ISvara. clearly, ISvara cannot be under the sway of
any karma whatsoever. the very fact that He's an
ISvara means that He's is the lord of a "world"
(otherwise, He'd be called brahman, not ISvara). no
momentum of previous actions can be held to be the
cause for this. so, how is a "world" possible for
ISvara according to advaita? this point is still
unanswered.

now, back to your reply.

here SrI SankarAcArya refutes the nonexistence of a
body to the Atma svarUpam. this doesn't seem to be
against the view of the later advaitins. all that
bhagavadpAdAcArya says is that the Self was never
embodied to become disembodied.

even if the above argument is accepted, a jN.Ani can
only reside as a witness to the "world" (even this is
questionable). but he cannot do any activity with the
body that he "had" before realization, for according
to advaita, any activity can proceed only due to the
superimposition of a variety of things like mind, body
etc. on the Atma svarUpam. this, being primarily due
to avidyA, cannot exist for a jN.Ani. so, any karma
whatsoever, since it pertains only to a SarIra, which
is a product of avidyA, and hence itself (i.e. karma)
being mithyA, cannot exist for a jN.Ani.

consider this : to teach someone, a jIvanmukta has to
identify himself with a SarIra and what is more,
accept the existence of another person having avidyA,
both of which are not possible since they are the
result of superpositions on the Self. even if the
existence of a student is apparent to a jN.Ani, on
what ground will he identify the student with his
(i.e. the student's) SarIra? this raises another
question. can a jN.Ani perceive avidyA?

even if this is accepted, the "body" of a jN.Ani can
only remain like a corpse, no action should be
possible, for who is the performer of actions then?

this clearly expresses my point! a jN.Ani's "body"
just lies here. as for the jN.Ani himself, he's
bodiless.

again, SrI SankarAcArya clearly states "he's no more
embodied as before..". the implication is that a
jN.Ani does not have a SarIra, not that he is
indifferent to it. 

i'll make my point a little more clear. once a person
has aparokshAnubhUti, nothing other than the brahman
exists. now, how can "he" "come back" to a "world".
since in the state of AtmAnubhavam there is no
knowledge of a SarIra, using what will "he" superpose
on "himself" a "world"? (the words in quotes are just
to highlight the fact that these don't even exist in
the state of aparokshAnubhUti.) 

thank you for patiently reading this long mail.
