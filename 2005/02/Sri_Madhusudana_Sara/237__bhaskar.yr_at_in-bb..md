praNAm prabhujis
Hare Krishna

This question pertains to Sri Madhusudana Saraswati & his teachings. I
remember in the advaita-L list Sri Vidyashankar Sundaresan prabhuji in the
post shankara Acharya-s history says that Sri Madhusudana Saraswati dared
to differ from shankara in interpreting the prasthAna trayi...Since Sri
Vidya prabhuji giving us this information I firmly believe it is true...May
I ask learned members to give more details on this topic.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
