Ya, that may me interesting.   In Fact, even the Vedanta Prakriya Prathyabijna of Swami Sachidanandendra Saraswathi has not dealt with either Madhusudana Saraswathi or with Appaya Dikshitendra.

This question pertains to Sri Madhusudana Saraswati & his teachings. I
remember in the advaita-L list Sri Vidyashankar Sundaresan prabhuji in the
post shankara Acharya-s history says that Sri Madhusudana Saraswati dared
to differ from shankara in interpreting the prasthAna trayi...Since Sri
Vidya prabhuji giving us this information I firmly believe it is true...May
I ask learned members to give more details on this topic.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
