Dear list members,

When I looked at the bodhaayana muula suutras for this ritual, I see
only the mantraanukramah and notes on what fruits one can expect on
performing this ritual.

Is this supposed to be chanted by 4 purohits at a time? That's what I
remember reading/hearing somewhere. I don't see any reference to this
in the muula suutras. Or am I confusing it with some other ritual?

Thanks!

Rama
