You got it wrong. They DO NOT want to connect to their
history and carry on their time-hallowed traditions.

What seems sensible is to give respect and value and
opportunity to all humans on the basis of higher
understanding of life and people and psychology. A
common man is much better informed of his rights and
opportunities in the changed society. What many people
want is to integrate the new knowledge into mainstream
life than to go back to the hallowed traditions of
Manu etc. At the same time, the Vedic knowledge is not
'owned' by the upper castes either. Similarly the new
scientific knowledge is not owned by either the upper
castes or the lower castes. Let all benefit from the
knowledge in the way they choose.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
