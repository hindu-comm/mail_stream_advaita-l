 Dear sirs, 

           These are the  days when almost a majority of the upper caste people are feeling it a burden or a hinderence to wear the upanayan on their bodies.  Now you are advising Sudras and dalitas also should wear the upanayana. The Pancha Sikha Upanayana system has almost extinguished from the society.  I dont dispute if any one explains the merits of upananayana in a scientific way.  But What is the use when the person who wears the thread is not feeling it that sanctity?  

           In my openion, it would be better if this just customary symbol, which exibits a separatist mentality in the society must be abolished as early as possible.

           Please excuse me if I have exeeded the limits.
