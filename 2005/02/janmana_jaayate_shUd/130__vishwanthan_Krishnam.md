Based on one's livelihood and way of life the
classification is still valid.

professions and knowledge become hereditary over time,
this is applicable to all castes and creed leading to
imbalance this is applicable to all societies not
restricted to India alone. 
the ruling class (kings) guarded zealously their
kingdoms for their off springs, businessmen imparted
their trade only to their own (some trades are still
that way even till date), priests guarded their
secrets by building a veil of ignorance etc...
Just as how difficult it is to find out what the
priest does inside the sanctum, it is equally
difficult to find out the recipe from a cook or the
exact temperature and mix of elements to be used to
produce exotic jewelry from a goldsmith unless one
belongs to that community.
Every few generations, society gradually attempts to
correct itself (for example there are not a lot of
kingdoms/Empires surviving today) however leading to
over-correction and thus stability is sill an utopian
concept. This is what makes studying history,
religion, myths, urban legends and philosophy
fascinating.  
Unfortunately societies can over-correct to an extent
of becoming extinct too! 
Maybe over an over-arching period there will be a form
of positive dynamic stability.
At a point in time a particular solution may hold good
but there is a very high probability that it will not
be valid later on.
i am a brahmin when i do nityakarma, a vaysia when i
purchase groceries and at work and a kshatriya when i 
manage others. according to Manu i should be a shudra
by my actions however the government i am sure will
still classify me as a brahmin. re classification at
the very least will provide my children with a better
shot at acquiring education and work in some states(
which takes me back to my second statement).
