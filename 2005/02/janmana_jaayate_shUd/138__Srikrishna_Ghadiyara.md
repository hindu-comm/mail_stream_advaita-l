My question pertains to this very point. 

Are you saying that whatever may be the caste i.e
brAhmaNa, vaisya, kshatriya, SUdra, all the four,
(acording to you any male) interested in learning vEda
can learn, and should be taught, after they duly
undergo upanayana ceremony? 

Are you saying that all the four castes can undergo
upanayana ceremony ? It may so happen that a SUdra
wants to undergo upanayana ceremony, and not study
vEda like most of the other three castes do. So, we
can generalize that upanayana is OK for all the four
castes, and would you clarify if the all the 4 castes
after upanayana are eligible for all the karma that a
brAhmaNa is supposed to perform including nitya,
naimittika karmas.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
