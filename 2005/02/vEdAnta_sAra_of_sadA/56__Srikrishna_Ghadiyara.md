hariH Om !!

Here is what Svami Dayananda has to say about
references to aShtanga yOga steps mentioned in vEdAnta
sAra text:

*****
If after shravana, manana, nididhyasana fruits of
insight of being Brahman is not present, some
reorientation may be necessary.

For shravana or nididhyasana some disciplined life is
required. So samadhi sadhana or any other discipline
such as puja etc. can be a updalakshana.  Even
learning classical music may be good for you. We will
use any every thing available. But, it has nothing to
do with Vedanta. If primary end is clear, then
everything else necessary, you can do. Vedanta has
used developments of sAmkhya, mImamsa also.

About meditation: Meditation is useless for atma
jnanam. Known Atma does nto require meditation and if
Atma is not known, there is nothing to meditate. Atma
is an object of shravanam.

Atma is nirvikalpaH. It is different from nirvikalpa
samadhi. nirvikalpa samadhi is not turIya. turIya is
your understanding of svarUpa of Atma. 

shravanam is 'angi' and manana, nididhyasana are
'anga'.

With the understanding of Vedanta, you can help
yourself with any part, not necessarily all parts, of
aShtanta yOga.

For Vedanta samadhi is samAhita buddhi. samadhi should
be interpreted as per sampradaya only. As per sAmkhya
and yOga, atmas are many, and pradhana is separate
from chaitanya. It is dual. It is not acceptable to
Vedanta. Sankara discussed these topics and refuted
their stand. 

In the vEdAnta sAra book the author has converted the
terminology into Vedanta. The savikalpa samadhi and
nirvikalpa samadhi are nididhyasana only.

nirvikalpa samadhi is 'angi' and the eight steps
(eigth being savikalpa samadhi) are 'anga'.
*****

Svami Dayananda also has explained the above points
with reference to the following:

-----------
para 109 : tatra savikalpakO nAma jnAtru-jnAnAdi
vikalpa laya anapEkshayA advitIya vastuni ...

para 197 : nirvikalpakastu jnAtru-jnAnAdi vikalpa laya
apEkshayA advitIya vastuni ....

refer to 'advitIya vastu' indefining samAdhi, which is
not in sync with yOga definition, so these terms have
been converted to convey the Vedanta philosophy.

similarly, para 206:

advitIya vastuni sntarindriya dhAraNam dhAraNa ..
refers to advitIya vastu even for dhAraNa
-----------

Hope this clarifies.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
