hariH Om !!

In the last few months I listened to lectures of Svami
Dayananda of Arsha Vidya on vEdAnta sAra of Sadananda,
and with that background, I read through this small
text. My doubts about some contents of this text on
ISvara and jIva are still not resolved. I have learnt
to live with confusion !! 

Attached please find my notes. You are most welcome to
write to me to clarify the doubts I have mentioned in
my notes.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
