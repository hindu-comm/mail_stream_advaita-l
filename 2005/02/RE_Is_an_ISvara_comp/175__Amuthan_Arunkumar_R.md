you're statement is that a jN.Ani sees the world as
brahman.my contention is that for a jN.Ani, only
brahman exists, a world does not exist in the first
place, so u'r argument doesn't answer my point.

i agree that the world does not exist the way he
thought it was earlier. but why does a world exist at
all for him?

there are only two states, either a person is under
mAyA or he is the brahman. there is no state in
between. in the above analogy, the matrix still exists
for him. he just is not deluded by it. the proper
extension is that of an advanced sAdhaka who is not
affected by the world, though the world exists for
him. but for a jN.Ani, this is not the case. to put it
in ur words, there's no matrix to be deluded by it!

which is equivalent to my statement that it doesn't
exist!
