Hari Om!

According to the rules of this group, I am supposed to introduce myself.
So I will say that I am from the UK and I would like to know more about
Advaita-vAda as taught by ZrIpAda ZaGkarAcArya.

I will do this by sitting back and observing the list discussions
mainly, but I may ask a question from time to time. Hopefully the
respected members here will find my queries to be fruitful.

I am also a member of the "advaitins" yahoogroup and I had heard about
this group that was run by the famous V. Sundaresan, so I inquired about
the URL location of this group and was kindly given it.

Kind regards,

D. Jay
