We must be careful to distinguish between the Yoga system as a separate 
school of philosophy and yoga practice as a means to attaining knowledge. 
Taken as a separate system, Yoga is dualistic and there is no doubt that 
this is rejected. Especially see brahmasUtra bhAShya 2.1.3, under the sUtra 
etena yogaH pratyuktaH.

When it comes to the practice of yoga in the process of gaining knowledge, 
the situation is very different. Taking the bhagavadgItA, taittirIya and 
bR^ihadAraNyaka commentaries together, along with upadeSasAhasrI, it is very 
clear that SankarAchArya assigns a definite place for the practice of yoga 
(as commonly understood). This does not mean that yogic accomplishment is 
equated with liberation nor that yoga practice is seen as absolutely 
necessary for realization. I will touch on this in greater detail in my 
continuing posts on the gItAbhAShya.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
