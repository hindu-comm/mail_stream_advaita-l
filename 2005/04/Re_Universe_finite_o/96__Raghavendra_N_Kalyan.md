>Badisa: You havent yet quoted any sruti references to prove that a part of infinity is infinity. >All of your is mere speculation.


We dont need Sruti references for proving this point. The point has already proved using logical considerations. That we need Sruti references even for this, is your opinon only, which I respect. Why are you not asking for Sruti references to prove that 2+2 = 4? Even assuming that we really need Sruti references, I dont find that you have quoted even one to prove or disprove the point.

It would be really worth while if you read the posts more carefully. I did not claim that rAmAnuja (not rAmAnujam) had an interpretation of purusha sUkta that we need to accept. I dont even know, for that matter, if he had commented on the purusha sUkta. All I asked you was to look at the interpretation in a srI vaishNava website, which incidentally, does not differ much from what I think of as the meaning of the relevant verses of the purusha sUkta. The point is that creation is a quarter of the purusha according to RV etc., no matter what you say.

Please dont brush the issue under the carpet. Do me a favour and answer a direct question. Where, in gIta 10.42, does Sankara explicitly mention that the universe is finite. I dont need your interpretations, even if I may respect them. Please quote Sankara directly.

Between "interpretations" of Sruti given by you and those given by an authentic purANa, there is no choice. Your imaginative interpretations dont render a purANa as anti-Sruti.


>Now, can you tell me what the above points confirm and conclude? Dont they show the finite >nature of universe?  Can anybody go against sruti declarations or Lord Krishnas teachings?


The only person who seems to be going against them is you. As for Lord Krishna's teachings, I dont remember him mentioning anywhere that the created universe is finite. However, since you dont accept even sound logic, I doubt if you would accept this.
