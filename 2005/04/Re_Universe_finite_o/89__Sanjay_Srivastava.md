I am not clear how the above conclusion is supported by shruti.

Even if it did, it would be beyond the scope of shruti. Shruti is taken as 
pramana where other means of knowledge viz. pratyaksha etc. are not 
available. "Whether the universe is finite or infinite?" is a question that 
can fall within purview of shruti, since this knowledge is not available 
through other pramanas. However, to decide "whether a part of infinity is 
infinity or not", is not the legitimate jurisdiction of shruti. Since this 
knowledge can be gained by other pramanas such as deduction etc., shruti 
cannot be taken as final arbiter here.

Though it may not seem very intuitive, a fractional part of infinity is 
indeed infinity. This knowledge is available as aparA vidyA. Why go to parA 
vidyA for this?  Regards.
