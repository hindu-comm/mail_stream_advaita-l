Dear Badisa and group

My "example from mathematics" was not given to prove the infinite nature of 
the universe - which it could not possibly do - or even to add weight to the 
idea that it is infinite. On the question of the infinitude of the universe I am 
actually agnostic. I gave it merely as a second illustration of the fact that 
it is still possible to meaningfully refer to a quarter of "something" even 
if that something is infinite. Furthermore that this is true not merely for 
physical somethings but for abstract ones as well.
