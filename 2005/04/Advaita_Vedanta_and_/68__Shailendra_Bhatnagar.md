Krunalji, I don't know much about Advaita but I know that Avidya is Anadi(beginningless) so there is no question of how it started. Secondly, you say below (snippet of your email is below) that "Paramatma took the help...".  That would mean he possesses 2 contradictory sets of attributes at the same time : 

(a) Satyam, Jnanam and Anantam
(b) Sattva, Rajas and Tamas

Does that sound logical ? I would say no.  I don't think these issues can be explained or reasoned with human logic but I will let the experts comment on your article.

regards,
Shailendra
