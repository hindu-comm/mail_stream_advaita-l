Dear Shailendra,

Firstly thank you for your reply, firstly i would like to make clear, i am 
in no way in any authority to speak on the sastra's but i just put my view 
across of what i think may have happened.

I also did realise i made a mistake in the article by saying Paramatma took 
the help of...what i ment by this is that paramatma created the Gunas, to 
create the world (this would also be found in the Bhagavat Purana). 
Everything is created by God, but realisation that atma is brahman is the 
only true realisation.

Krunal Makwana

>Krunalji, I don't know much about Advaita but I know that Avidya is 
Anadi(beginningless) so there is no question of how it started. Secondly, 
you say below (snippet of your email is below) that "Paramatma took the 
help...".  That would mean he possesses 2 contradictory sets of 
attributes at the same time :
>
>(a) Satyam, Jnanam and Anantam
>(b) Sattva, Rajas and Tamas

>Does that sound logical ? I would say no.  I don't think these issues 
can be explained or reasoned with human logic but I will let the experts 
comment on your article.
