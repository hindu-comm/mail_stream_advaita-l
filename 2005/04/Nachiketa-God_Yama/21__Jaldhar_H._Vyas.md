Having established that it is possible for men to achieve jnana, the doubt
arises: is jnana possible for other intelligent beings such as the Gods?
This is discussed in Brahmasutra 1.3.26

taduparyapi bAdarAyaNa.h saMbhavAt || 26 ||

Those higher also says Badarayana because of possibility.

According to Maharshi Badarayana, the higher beings can get jnana because
it is possible to pursue the means.  Naturally because Badarayana is the
author of the Brahmasutra, this is considered the siddhanta.

Shankaracharya says that the Devas being living beings posessed of
consciousness also can desire moksha.  Because they have bodies they can
learn the Vedas, meditate, practice yoga etc which are means of pursuing
moksha.

(the other sutras in this adhikarana upto 33, are also interesting in what
they say about the nature of the Devas but not directly relevant to your
question)

As per Advaita Vedanta, jnana can occur in any time and place because it
is not bound by time and place.  The sutra previously mentioned, says that
the Devas have the capacity to pursue jnana.

Shankaracharya mentions Chandogyopanishad 8.11.3 where Indra learns
brahmavidya and Taittereyopanishad Brghuvalli where Varuna teaches his
son Maharshi Bhrgu (implying that he already has jnana himself.)  And of
course this story is an example.

In Brahmasutra 1.3.27, there is an objection to the idea that the Devas
have bodies.  If A is doing a yajna in Kashi and Agni is physically
present there, how could B do a yajna in Prayaga at the same time?  The
answer given is that the Devas can assume multiple bodies at will and as
needed.

As far as Advaita Vedanta is considered, God does not arbitrarily give or
withhold rewards to his creatures on a whim.  He impartially awards to
them what their own karma has wrought.  Furthermore per the Mimamsaka
view, all stories etc. in the shastras are only for the purpose of
encouraging or prohibiting actions of various kinds.  Nachiketa doesn't
get jnana as a boon, but because his own renunciation had prepared him for
it.  The "curse" and "boon" are just a contrivance on the part of Lord
Yama which inter alia also teaches us that it is a sin to not serve a
guest.  ("atithi devo bhava", the taittereyopanishad says.)

Because of his lack of understanding, it took Lord Indra several tries
before he was prepared for jnana.  On the other hand we read of e.g.
Hastamalakacharya, the disciple of Shankaracharya who despite being deaf
and dumb, only had to look at his Guru before he became enlightened.  In
both cases, it is the preparedness of the pupil not the whim of the
teacher which is responsible for jnana.

Destruction is a poor translation for what happens at pralaya.  It is more
like reabsorption.  All the names and forms of God (who is saguna brahman)
are shed much like a snake sheds his skin and only pure brahman remains.
