Namaste.

Neither the body nor  the senses are real (in the absolute
sense) , because vAsanAs fill them up. The mind therefore
has to be filled up (kumbhayet) by dhyAna, pUjA and japa.

Synopsis:  The glory of ones own Self. To obtain that is
svAtmaikya-j~nAna. All the vAsanAs of association or
friendship must be diverted to lead to this.  The way is by
the rescension of the non-Self. The wise man fixes his mind
on the Infinite Bliss of the Self. Maturity comes from yoga
practice again and again. Undesirous of the fruit of Karma,
 one does his karma with the bhAvanA: I am neither the
doer nor the experiencer. Gradually one attains  peace by
persistent practice of this. Not thinking of the fruit of
karma the mind empties itself. All desires that usually
arise from the mind  now vanish because of there being no
fuel for them. Even the rituals like worship of agni,
yajna, charity, tapas, etc. all can be done without the
egoistic thought coming in. The traditional karma or duties
are not to be discarded. They have to be performed. It is
the mind that has to be monitored by the intellect towards
this end.  Scriptures ordain us to do our svadharma. Our
dharma is to move closer and closer to the goal of our own
Self. This Self is nothing but brahman  was taught even at
the time of upanayanam. One wears the brahma-sUtra as a
testimony of that initiation into brahman, but even then
one forgets to do the right thing for the obtaining of the
Self. When this dharma is not done, of what consequence
will the performance of other dharmas be?

Synopsis: Such yogis attain Immortality  This is the
refrain. They read the mind by their own minds. They are
immersed in their own Glory of the Self.  The words:
attain Immortality is only a formal way of saying. It is
the persistent and continued immersion in the thought of
the Self that brings success. ahaM veda na me mRRityuH is
the vedic declaration meaning I dont know death. The
significance of this statement is that the thought I am
the body is a very narrow view of oneself and it is this
thought that has to be eroded by resorting to the thought
of the Self.
