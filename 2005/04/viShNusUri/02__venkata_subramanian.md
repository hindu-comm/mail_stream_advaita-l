Well, i may add just one thing here.  Vishnu Suri's Rudra Bhashya tries to put forth the theory that Sri Rudra is an Upanishad.

i spoke with Pandits from Mathur on this, they said that tradition does not hold so.  Sri Rudra - is to be equated, according to them, to the 11th Chapter of the Gita, nothing more, nothing less. 

Namaste,
Venkat

At the end of the work Sri VS gives out the details on the day he
completed the work. But does not give the absolute year in the 
SalivAhana Sakha, but only the cyclic year name. In that while 
referring to himself, he merely says the he is pANDuraN^gAN^gajAtaH, 
and named viShNu.

In any case, this book is tough to read and I am not aware of any
available translation. If you know, please let me know.
