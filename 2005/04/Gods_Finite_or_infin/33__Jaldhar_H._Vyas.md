If they can assume any body at any place or any time, they must be
omnipresent to begin with.

No  more or less so than a human jivanmukta.

Their souls (or the soul) were always divine and all-pervasive.  The
boundaries that "localize" are made of false knowledge only.

This is only to the extent that they are dealing with ignorant beings.
Compare with Krishna Bhagavan telling Arjuna that the only reason he
appears in this form rather than his vishvarupa is that Arjuna is not able
to handle it.  In the same way, Yama has to appear to Nachiketa in a form
that Nachiketa can comprehend in order to teach him Brahmavidya.

It is omnipresence but only withing the limits of the material univers.
Brahman "covers all this and 10 finger beyond" as the purushsukta says.
Furthermore, this is the reason why Brahmasutra 4.4.17 says the liberated
souls have  every power _except_ creation.  They cannot go beyond their
created nature.

The answer is as I said above Brahman is more than the material universe.
