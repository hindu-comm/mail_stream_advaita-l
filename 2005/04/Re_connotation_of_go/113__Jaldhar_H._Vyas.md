Yes, there is a difference between the human and the divine, but even
below the level of pure Brahman it is not necessary to assume an
inseperable gulf.  Rather Advaita Vedanta assumes a continuum of
consciousness from the animals up to the Gods with humans being somewhere
in the middle.

This is an appropriate place to quote from the introduction of
Shankaracharyas' Gita bhashya.

"When after a long time the upholders of Dharma had become deluded by
material pleasures and had lost the capacity for viveka and jnana and so adharma
was on the increase and dharma was being drowned by adharma, then the one
who wishes for the welfare of the world, the primordial creator Vishnu
known as Narayana, to protect the Brahmanahood of the Brahmanas on earth,
placed a fraction [of Himself] in Devaki by Vasudeva known as Krishna."

There is nothing wrong with thinking God is "a big man in the sky."  The
danger is in thinking God is ONLY a big man in the sky.  The theists want
to put limits on God.  By claiming he is only one way, they want to deny
him in all other ways.  How is this not an ego trip?
