I think he felt that Advaita Vedanta was truer to the Upanishads while
vishishtadvaita was a better interpretation of the Brahmasutras.  This
could be because he was a Christian, but in anycase his personal opinions
did not bias his translation as far as I can tell.  While Swami
Krishnananda goes overboard in trying to make Vedanta look "modern."

One relevant text is the bhashya on 2.3.43-53 especially on 51-53.  Here
Shankaracharya is quite clear that the plurality of selves is avidya only.
However we have to take into account that "identification with Brahman" is
saguna as well as nirguna.  The first also liberates from samsara but it
is not the ultimate knowledge (which is the latter.) so there is still
some avidya and the scope for plurality that entails.
