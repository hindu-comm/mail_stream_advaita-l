I must point out that as of April 10th 2005, there cannot be
more than one posting per person outside the topic of the GItA.

It is a mistake to assume or conclude that the Ishvara cannot
create an infinite universe. Please read the excerpt from the
Brahma vaivarta purANa at
http://www.escribe.com/religion/advaita/m13866.html :

"Who will search through the wide infinity of space to
count the universes side by side, each containing its
own Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva? Who will number the
Indras in them all, reigning in all the innumerable
worlds; those others who have passed away before them;
or even the Indras who succeed each other in any given
line, one by one, ascending to kingship, and one by
one, passing away? O king of the Devas, there are
among your servants who maintain that it may be
possible to number the grains of sand on earth and the
drops of rain that fall from the sky, but no one will
ever number all those Indras. This is what the Knowers
Know.

"The life and kingship of one Indra endure seven
yugas, and when 28 Indras have expired, one day and
night of Brahma has elapsed. But the existence of one
Brahma, measured in such Brahma days and nights, is
only one hundred and eight years. Brahma follows
Brahma, one sinks, the next arises; the endless series
cannot be told. There is no end to the number of
Brahmas, to say nothing of Indras. 

"As delicate boats float on the waters of the world,
the Brahmandas (egg of Brahma - the genesis of
creation) float on the fathomless, pure waters that
form the body of Vishnu. Out of every pore of the body
of Vishnu, a universe bubbles and breaks. Will you
presume to count them? Will you calculate the gods in
all those worlds - the worlds present and the worlds
past?" 

-Kartik
