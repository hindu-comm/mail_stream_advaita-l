When I was reading IshAvAsyopaniShad bhAshya, I found that the key is to 
ask the question who is the adhikAri for this. Based on this, AchArya 
classifies the work quite neatly based on this and resolves any apparent 
conflict.

In the same lines ...

Do you have any guideline that we should bear in mind while approaching 
any verse of gItA?

I am of the opinion, that there are somethings specifically directed to 
those who are stuck in pravRtti mArga, and that advice  cannot be given 
  universal validity  to discount jnAna mArga. Is this correct? Do you 
thing taking the same approach and asking who is the adhikAri will hold 
good for gItA?

Thank you. If the question is too dumb to address, kindly ignore it.
