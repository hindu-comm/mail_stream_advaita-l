Can members list the available sub-commentaries on our AchArya-s 
bhAshyam and also other commentaries that are in agreement with it.
If possible, please include the publisher information.

A historical sketch of commentatorial tradition in this regard will also 
be useful [1].


Thank you in advance.


Ravi
