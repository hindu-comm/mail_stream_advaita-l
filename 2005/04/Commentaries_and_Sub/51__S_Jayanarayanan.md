There is a good website that gives the transliterated
commentaries of shrIdhara, madhusUdana, vishvanAtha and bAladeva
as an all-in-one commentarial work. Unfortunately, I have not
been able to find the parent site (that is associated with the
Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts), but only been able
to read the chapters one by one:

http://ignca.nic.in/sanskrit/bhagavad_gita_02.pdf

http://ignca.nic.in/sanskrit/bhagavad_gita_03.pdf

and so on.

Regards,

Kartik
