namaste Sri Venkat:

Thank you very much.

a) Is the sridhara you mention same as sridhara svAmi, whose commentary 
is called subodhini? I saw this name in the worldcat search.

b) Who is this venkaTanAthA?

c) We can add j~nAneSvarI to this list under the section other 
commentaries. (http://www.bvbpune.org/contents1.html)


Thank you.

Ravi
