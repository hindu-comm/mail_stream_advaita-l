Shridhara oddly enough is regarded by Gaudiya Vaishnavas as one of their
own though he clearly follows the Advaita understanding of the Gita.

Nilakantha has commented on the entire Mahabharata.  His Gita Tika is only
a part of that.

When we are talking about Advaitic commentaries on the Gita, let us not
forget Shankaranandi tika of Swami Shankarananda Sarasvati.  He was
jagadguru of Shringeri and the paramaguru of Swami Vidyaranya, and also
the author of Dipikas on the Upanishads, Atmapurana, and other Vedantic
works.
