namo nArAyaNAya !

dear list members,

just a piece of thought on discussions on the gItA.
but it's upto the moderators to accept or reject it. 

so far (i.e. after the beginning of the pArthiva
sa.mvatsaram), no solid discussion has been started on
any topic in SrImadbhagavadgItA (though there has been
some discussions on some general topics that can be
related to the gItA). i think it won't be a bad idea
to go one adhyAya after another starting from the
first. All the other discussions like yoga and advaita
in gItA etc. can be carried on simultaneously. if we
go on just by general topics like yoga in gItA etc.
there won't be an overall thread connecting all the
posts (unless the moderators have already planned that
out, in which case this mail can be ignored.) rather,
if we go systematically into the gItA, we can
integrate all the various topics at appropriate
places. 

i kindly request the moderators/senior members of the
list to start a systematic discussion as soon as
possible.
