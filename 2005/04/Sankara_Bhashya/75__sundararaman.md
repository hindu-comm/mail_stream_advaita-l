I saw a mail being exchanged on recording of Sankara Bhashya etc.First I am interested in bringing out an authentic version of Sankara Moola Bhashya in CD form as well as to maintain a Web site if possible with powerful search features.
Ramakrishna Mutt hv attempted to bring out Moola Upanishads,Gita,Brahma Suthra and not Bhashya.
Can anybody throw any light if this is already available or will take up this work.
