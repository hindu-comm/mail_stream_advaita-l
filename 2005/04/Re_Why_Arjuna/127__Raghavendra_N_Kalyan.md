Arjuna and Krishna are spoken of as incarnations of the two sages nara and nArAyaNa, who enjoy a special relationship. So it appears natural that Krishna should choose Arjuna to reveal the truths. A question here - Is this sage nArAyaNa of mahAbhArata, the same person as the other nArAyaNa - the seer of the purusha sUkta?
