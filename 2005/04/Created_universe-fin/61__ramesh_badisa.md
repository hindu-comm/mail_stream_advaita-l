It is a mistake to assume or conclude that the Ishvara cannot

create an infinite universe. Please read the excerpt from the

Brahma vaivarta purANa at 


Badisa: As per modern Astronomy, the universe is expanding. Only a finite thing can expand and grow. Thus, universe is finite. Let us forget this example of modern Astronomy. Let us see what Gita 10/42 says. Lord Krishna here says that the whole created universe represents his one part. We do not know how many such parts exist. Doesnt it show the finite nature of created universe? Sri Shankara and sri Ramanuja agreed on this too. Also please refer Rig Ved 10.90.3 (Pado Asya . Amruta divi ..) to understand the finite nature of created universe. With the help of Puranas, one can take many sides in a discussion  (why only this and why not that type) and thus no one can reach any conclusions. 

Namaste
