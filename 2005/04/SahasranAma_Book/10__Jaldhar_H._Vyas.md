A compilation.  In six volumes it has the prasthana trayi bhashyas, other
bhashyas, prakaranas, shrividya works, and stotras.  A committee of
learned pandits carefully chose the works that could be considered genuine
works of Shankaracharya.

It has been reprinted many times by Samata books, Chennai.
