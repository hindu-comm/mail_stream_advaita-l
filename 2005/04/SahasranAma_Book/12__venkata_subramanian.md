Srirangam Edition (Vani Vilas) was originally publised in 20 volumes; has been re-printed by Samata books - in 10 Volumes.  By the way, the Vani Vilas edition has also been considered by Swami Sachindanendra Saraswathi of Holenarsipur in his edition.  He has also considered Anandasrama Edition, and the Vani Vilas Edition of Varanasi.  He has chosen that 'pata' that which is the best.  

The issue is, in that edition, at a few places, he has pointed out Asadhu in Sri rangam edition too.  But i believe for the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, he has relied more on the Vani Vilas Edition.  Unfortunately, we have his Sanskrit Edition only for Isa, Kena, Katha, Munkada, and Thaithreya Upanishads.  the Aithareya complete 6 chapter edition with Shankara Bhashya, i dont know when will it come.  for others, only the vani vilas edition is better, it seems, as of now.

regards,
venkat.

A compilation. In six volumes it has the prasthana trayi bhashyas, other
bhashyas, prakaranas, shrividya works, and stotras. A committee of
learned pandits carefully chose the works that could be considered genuine
works of Shankaracharya.

It has been reprinted many times by Samata books, Chennai.
