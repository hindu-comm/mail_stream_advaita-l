Can any one please tell me where to lay hands to buy a copy of the Vishnu Sahasranama commentary of Bhagawan Sri Shankaracharya along with the sub - commentary of Taraka Brahmashrami - both published in Sanskrit by the Mysore University.

am trying to get copies, but they are not available any where.

regards,

Venkat
