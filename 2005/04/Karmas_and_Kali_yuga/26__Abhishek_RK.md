Namaste,
I have heard some people saying that in Kali Yuga all the karmaphala
of all our karmas is got in "this" life itself. I have serious doubts
about this as to the relation between kali yuga and karmas (is there
any relation?). Is this supported by shastras or siddhanta?

Dhanyavadah,
Abhishek
