> c) We can write to RK Math and get permission to read the English

>
> d) I think Sri Krishna Warrier's book is easy to read, as the sanskrit

> e) There is good free recording software called Audacity
> (sourceforge.net) that help everyone to record in a standard way.

> Your help and guidance on this matter will be greatly appreciated.
