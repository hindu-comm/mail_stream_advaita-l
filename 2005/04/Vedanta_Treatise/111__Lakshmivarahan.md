I had the good fortune of reading the book, "Vedanta Treatise" by A. 
Parthasarathy. It was a blissful experience. I have condensed the book. 
I take pleasure in sharing this experience by sending the first section of 
my condensed version.

I intend sending this as a serial mail, instead of a single large file in 
one go, as no one would be interested in reading it in one go.

Please let me have your feedback on this.
