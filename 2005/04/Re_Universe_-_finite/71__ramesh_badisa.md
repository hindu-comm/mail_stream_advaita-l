If purusha is infinite, so must be a quarter of the purusha

Badisa: Your opinions are respectable. But, please quote sruti references to your views.

Exactly the opposite  

Badisa: Who has to say this?

for there is no reason why a part of infinity cannot be infinity

Badisa: Please quote sruti authority for your understanding. 

Please provide complete quotes with references of Shankara

Badisa: Please refer 10/42 in The Bhagavad Gita with the commentary of Sri Sankaracharya, Samata Books, Madras, by sri Alladi Mahadeva Sastry.

Also please refer 10/42 in Bhagavad Gita Bhasya of sri Sankaracharya with text and English translation, by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier, published from sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras.

In this case, since the purushha is

infinite, the universe is also infinite, for one-fourth of infinity is infinity!

Badisa: The moment you say one-fourth, you are invariably implying its finite nature. There is no doubt about it. But, as always I respect the views expressed by you. Can you quote some references if possible?

All of scripture leads to only one conclusion -- the created universe is infinite

Badisa: The references quoted earlier by me do not conclude your above views please.

Namaste
