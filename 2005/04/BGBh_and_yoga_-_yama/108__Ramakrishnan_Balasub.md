Excellent observation! There is really no point in trying to define
words independent of context. First the same word can be used in
different ways. See for example how Sankara uses vidyA to mean a)
brahmaGYAna and identical with brahman and b) upAsana, which are quite
different. Or for example avidyA to mean a) the mutual superimposition
of brahman with non-brahman or b) rituals.

Secondly, definitions of many sAdhana related words like tapas are
used in very different senses, and in particular depend on the ability
of the sAdhaka. The aporAkShAnubhUti turns the definitions of the
classical yoga and define it from the advaitic point of view. It's not
meant to to deride the classical definitions, which are certainly
useful for a beginner.  Both definitions are useful, depending on the
ability of the sAdhaka. No wonder a guru is held to be essential for
brahmaGYAna.
