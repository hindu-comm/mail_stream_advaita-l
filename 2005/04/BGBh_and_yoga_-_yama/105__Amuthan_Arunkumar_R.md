well, there may be a lot of definitions of tapas
elsewhere, but one that i can immediately refer to is
the definition of tapas in a three-fold way given by
SrI kR^ishNa in SrImadbhagavadgItA,

Worship of deva-s, dvija-s, guru, and the enlightened
sages, cleanliness, straightforwardness, continence
and non-violence constitute the tapas of the body.
