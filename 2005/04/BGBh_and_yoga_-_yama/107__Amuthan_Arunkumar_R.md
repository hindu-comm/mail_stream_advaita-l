i guess u'r right. i'm extremely sorry to have
overlooked this simple thing. 

but i'd like to add some more regarding definitions of
terms like tapas...

i'd like to point out that terms like tapas, mouna
etc. can be defined both from the point of view of a
jIvanmukta and a sAdhaka. for instance, mouna may in
the beginning stages i.e. for a sAdhaka, be defined as
not speaking, i.e. silence. in the next stage, this
definition can be improved as eliminating thoughts
from the minds and keeping it thougtless. but from the
point of view of a jIvanmukta, mouna is abidance in
the Self. of course, the true definition is that given
by a jIvanmukta and all other definitions converge to
the true definition as a sAdhaka advances. 

similarly, the above mentioned definition of tapas by
SrI ramaNa maharshi is from the point of view of a
jIvan mukta. 

from the point of view of a sAdhaka, tapas can be
taken as "SarIraSoshaNam" (SANDilyopanishad) which is
also in some sense the same as "dvandva sahanam" as
SrI ravi pointed out earlier.

well, from the sAdhaka's point of view, translation of
tapas as "penance" or "austerity" seems to be a good
translation though, it may not be the true meaning
(which only a jIvanmukta knows).
