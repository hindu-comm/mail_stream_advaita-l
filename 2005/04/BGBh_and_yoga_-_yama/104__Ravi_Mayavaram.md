Hi Karthik:

vyAsa bhAShya of yoga sUtra-s define tapas as "dvanda-sahanam". That is 
enduring the duals/opposites such as sukha-duHkha etc. I think gItA 
calls the same as titIxa (2-14).

To my surprise, I found that IIT Kanpur site does not have all of the 
yogasUtrabhAShya. I will send the exact line for this tomorrow.
