Is the word "tapas" ever defined (as in a formal definition) in
any of the scriptures (gItA or elsewhere), or is the meaning
taken for granted? I personally feel the usual translation of
"penance" does no justice to the word's true meaning.

Ganapati Muni, who was one of the most well-read scholars of the
last century, approached Ramana while the latter remained
immersed in silence most of the time and was largely unknown to
the public, and asked the question, "All that has to be read I
have read; even Vedanta sastra I have fully understood; I have
done japa to my heart's content; yet I have not up to this time
understood what tapas is. Therefore I have sought refuge at your
feet. Pray enlighten me as to the nature of tapas."

Ramana replied, now speaking, "If one watches whence the notion
'I' arises, the mind gets absorbed there; that is tapas. When a
mantra is repeated, if one watches whence that mantra sound
arises, the mind gets absorbed there; that is tapas."

After hearing that answer, Ganapati Muni began referring to
Ramana as "Maharshi" and "Bhagavan", and the names stuck. More
