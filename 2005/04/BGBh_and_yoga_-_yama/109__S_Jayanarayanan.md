Thanks for pointing out that there are definitions given for the
word tapas in the scriptures.

There may be many fine variations in the meaning of a word, but
it's always important to understand the basic meaning using a
definition. For example, the VivekachUDAmaNi provides clear
definitions for various qualities of a sAdhaka like shraddhA,
shama, dama, etc. The nArada bhakti sUtras have 3 definitions of
the term "bhakti", all of which are said to coincide. The
mImAmsA sUtras provide the definition of the term "dharma"
within the first few verses. It is because the word under
discussion was "tapas" that I requested a definition from the
scriptures.

If you look at the entry for "penance" in the Websters
dictionary (m-w.com):

1 : an act of self-abasement, mortification, or devotion
performed to SHOW SORROW OR REPENTANCE FOR SIN [capitals mine]
2 : A SACRAMENTAL RITE [capitals mine] that is practiced in
Roman, Eastern, and some Anglican churches and that consists of
private confession, absolution, and a penance directed by the
confessor
3 : something (as a hardship or penalty ) resembling an act of
penance (as in COMPENSATING FOR AN OFFENSE [capitals mine])

The translation seems to be along the lines of repentance for a
*sin*, which is somewhat closer to "prAyashchitta" than to
"tapas". I don't think tapas can be called a rite performed or a
show of repentance for the sake of expiation from sin.
