Firstly before i answer this question, i am in no authority to to proclaim 
this is the view of sanatan dharma, but i am just sharing my view, as you 
said.

Bhagvan Krishna sang the Gita to Arjuna, i think because of a number of 
reasons:

A) According to the bhagvatam there are 9 steps of Bhakti:
           1           2                  3                     4
|| Shravanam Kirtanam Visnu Smaranam  Paada Sevanam |
       5            6               7          8                  9
Archanam Vandandam Daasyam Sakhyam Atma Nivedanam ||

Arjuna had completed all the steps apart from Atma Nivedanam, and so Arjuna 
to realise the Supreme Brahman, Lord Krishna had given him the Bhagavad Gita 
for the 9th Step.

B) Another reason is that everyone within the Mahabharat had surrendered 
onto the Lord but had never asked for an instruction from Lord Krishna, 
Arjuna and Uddhava are the only two who had questioned the lord and so 
because of the question 2 beautiful Gita were composed (Bhagavad Gita and 
Uddhava Gita).

C) Arjuna within the battle field after having seen the armies, felt 
distraught and "who was thus overcome with pity and who was despondent, with 
eyes full of tears (BG 2.1)", took shelter and proclaimed "I am thy 
disciple", automatically making Lord Sri Krishna his Guru. So As is if 
Arjuna was a
disciple Lord Sri Krishna sang the Bhagavad Gita, as not a sandesh, not as a 
aadesh, but as THE Upadesh!

These i my views, that i have put forward, i hope they are usefull
