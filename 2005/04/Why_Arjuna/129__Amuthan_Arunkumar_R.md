namo nArAyaNAya !

dear list members,

i'd like to quote SrI SaN^karAchArya's view on the
relation between arjuna and the gItopadeSa, 

"(tayoScha
sarvakarmasa.nyAsapUrvakAdAtmaj~nAnAnnAnyato
nivR^ittiriti tadupadidixuH) **
sarvalokAnugrahArthamarjunaM nimittIkR^ityAha
bhagavAnvAsudevaH ** (aSochyAnityAdi)"

(gItA bhAshya, 2.10)

(the portion between the **'s gives us an idea of
bhagavadpAdAchArya's opinion on this issue.)

translation: "...** for the well-being of the entire
world, bhagavAn vAsudeva, USING ARJUNA AS A TOOL, says
**..."

taking only this view into account, there seems to be
nothing special about why arjuna was chosen. SrI
KR^ishNa used him as a tool to convey AtmavidyA to the
world. 

But there may be other references elsewhere which give
special reasons why arjuna was chosen. it would be
nice if someone can highlight any such references.

vAsudevaH sarvaM, 
aparyAptAmR^itaH
