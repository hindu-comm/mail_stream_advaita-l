Heres a question I would like to know listmembers thoughts about.  Don't
worry if you can't quote shastras about it, I'm more interested in your
own feelings.

The era of the Mahabharata contained great sages like Vyasa, great
warriors like Bhishma, wise statesmen like Vidura, and bhaktas of the
calibre of Narada.  Yet the truths of the Gita were revealed by Krishna
Bhagavan to Arjuna.  Why him of all people?
