on a par with is not equivalent to the same as.  Otherwise having multiple 
pramanas is redundant.

And why can't a dogma be logical?  Why can't a dogma be a valid means of 
truth?

Well actually no it isn't,  The Gaudiya school didn't exist before the 
15th century.  They didn't get around to commenting on the Brahmasutras 
till the 17th century, their primary scriptural emphasis is on the 
Bhagavata Purana and the Gita not the upanishads, they came from an area 
of India where Vedic tradition was very week...the point is the educated 
man suffers much less from interpretative maladies than you might think.

Can you give me a reason other than atheism why you would consider the 
pramana of pratyaksha to be more important than Shruti?
