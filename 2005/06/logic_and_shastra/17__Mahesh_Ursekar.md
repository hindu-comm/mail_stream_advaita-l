 Becuase a dogma has no basis to stand on except on blind belief. It can be 
proved wrong by a rational mind.

 You are right there. Infact, they waver when you mention that Krishna is 
not mentioned in the Upanishads. However, they also accept the dwaitin 
Madhavacharya is part of the lineage of teachers that has been handed down 
the 'true' teachings of the Vedas. So, in some ways they have reconciled in 
their minds that theirs is a complete philosophy based on all the teachings 
of the Vedas.

 It would be better to say that I would consider the 5 (pratyaksha, anuman, 
upamana, arthapatti and anupalabdi) more important that sruti. Only the 
first 5 can establish or disprove the claims of the sixth. And if they show 
the last praman to be invalid, I would not hesitate to throw it out of the 
window. 
 Humble pranams, Mahesh
