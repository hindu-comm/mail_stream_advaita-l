Pranams:
 > Logical arguments are subsidiary to scriptural statements.
 Agreed completely. But there is the question of what a scriptural statement 
actually says, isn't there? Every statement interpreted by one school is 
refuted with 'logic' by another, each considering for reasons of their own 
theirs to be the 'Truth'. So, in effect you don't really have a ground in 
which to say what a scriptural statement actually means!

 The current Dalai Lama has gone on record to say that the Buddhist 
scriptures can be thrown away if any of their truths are proved wrong by 
science, however dear they may be to him. So, did the great Buddha say - do 
not take me as a God but question every thing I tell you and reject it if it 
doesn't agree with reason. Would you hold Shruti as fact even if 'proved' 
invalid by science?

 Humble prostrations. Both for your having read this book and for letting me 
know that such books are available for the general public. Can you possibly 
point me to a place in Mumbai where I can get such treasures (in English 
only)? 
 Humble pranams, Mahesh
