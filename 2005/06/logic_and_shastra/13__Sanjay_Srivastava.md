"The current Dalai Lama has gone on record to say that the Buddhist  
scriptures can be thrown away if any of their truths are proved wrong 
by science, however dear they may be to him. So, did the great Buddha 
say - do not take me as a God but question every thing I tell you and 
reject it if it doesn't agree with reason. Would you hold Shruti as 
fact even if 'proved'
  invalid by science?"

Science and shruti operate in different realms that do not intersect. 
Science works on pratyaksha etc. as pramana while shruti is a pramana 
in itself. If something in shruti can be proved or disproved by other 
pramanas, it is not in the valid jurisdiction of shruti. Shruti is a 
pramana where no other pramana is available. How can therefore be any 
conflict between shruti and science or any other field of knowledge?

" Can you possibly point me to a place in Mumbai where I can get such 
treasures (in English only)?

For vedanta books (English) in Mumbai, try 1) Chetana Book Store at 
Kala Ghoda 2) Bharati Vidya Bhavan bookstore at Chowpatty 3) Motilal 
Banarasidas bookstore near Mahalaxmi Mandir and 4) (I forget the name) 
bookstore near shankar matham at Matunga. If something is not available 
at these four places, you can pretty much assume that it is not 
available in Mumbai.
