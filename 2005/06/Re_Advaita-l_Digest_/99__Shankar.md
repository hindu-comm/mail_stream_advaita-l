Pls continue this posting, this is agood system of
discussing Gita in a systematic way. Most of
the list members expressed their desire for
a systematic approach, especially, for person
like me who want to dwell in each slokas in detail
and gain further knowledge through the discussion between the learned
members of this list.

 I hope this will continue in the present way and I
suggest ,let us limit the interpretations and comments
on the given translations for week and continue with
the further slokas later on.

Pls consider my request.

Pranams
Shankar.
