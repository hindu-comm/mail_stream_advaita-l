I can't see how anyone especially someone of the purported calibre of 
Radhakrishnan could come to the conclusion that Shankaracharya believes 
reality is beyond words.  The famous "neti neti" most certainly doesn't 
imply this.

Why?  What makes you think hearing and reflecting on shastras doesn't 
involve thought processes?

I would remind readers again that the name of this discipline is not Aikya (one)
but a-dvaita. (not two.)  The purpose of jnana is to destroy the false 
conceptions at the end of which truth alone remains.  This I suppose would 
be the "reason".

Bhagavan does not play favorites with His creations but impartially alots 
consequences on the basis of their actions.  So the succesful dullard may 
have some virtues hidden under that dull exterior.
