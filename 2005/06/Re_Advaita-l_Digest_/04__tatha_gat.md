I am not well versed in Shankaracharya's writings
either, but, if by the above you mean that
Shankaracharya, via logical arguments, showed the
necessity  of noumenal reality, then, I believe that
is  not true. The few books of or about him that I
have read, in the end, depend on the scriptures for
their authority.

Furthermore, it is the enduring legacy of Kant and
Wittgenstein (and there may be others before Kant I
dont know of) that we simply cannot go beyond the
phenomenal world as long as we stick to means like
language and symbols to communicate our thoughts. Even
the scriptures extoll everyone to realize the noumenal
reality through deep meditation.

I also dont clearly follow your line of thinking. In
the first para you say that a dullard might be doing
better than an intelligent person because he has the
right attitude. In the next para you say that the
reason that the dullard does better than an
intelligent person is because an external agency is
helping him. The later does not follow from the
former. If anything may be deduced, it is that "if an
external agency exists, then it tends to help those
who have the right attitude"

Regards,
Mayuresh.
