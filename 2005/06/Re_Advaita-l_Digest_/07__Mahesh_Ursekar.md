 I fear my text was interpreted incorrectly possibly due to the incorrect 
juxtaposition of sentences. What I wanted to say was that S. Radhakrishnan 
in his book (and I confirmed this yesterday) mentions that Adi Sankaracharya 
arrived at the necessity of Brahman by pure logical arguments without 
recourse to the Upanishads. He did indeed do this in his Bhasya on the 
Gaudapada Karika. However, the need of existence of Brahman is quite 
different from being able to capture its profoundity in words. Infact, that 
is exactly what Wittgenstein was trying to show - that words and symbols 
cannot capture the essence of the noumenon or in Vedantic terms, Brahman.

>> Why? What makes you think hearing and reflecting on shastras doesn't

 I fully agree that meditating on the sruti requires a profound depth of 
thinking. However, the point of my post was whether one needs to depend on 
the conclusion ('*Prajnanam Brahma" - 'Brahman is conciousness')* solely 
based on the sruti or can one arrive at it with logical arguments.
 Regards, Mahesh
