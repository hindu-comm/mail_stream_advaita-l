 Two points. From what I have read, Wittgenstein never managed to prove his 
claim (that reality lies beyond words and symbols). He came close to it be 
never nailed it down. Infact, if he had done it, science would have been 
given a serious run for its money. Another point is that I believe S. 
Radhakrishnan in his classic two volume book on Indian philosophy makes a 
reference to the fact that Adi Sankaracharya managed to achieve this feat. 
Maybe the Sankaracharya's arguments were not as rigorous as required by 
current philosophy (which gets close to mathematics in rigor at times) but 
it would indeed be interesting is someone knows something about his 
thoughts. 
 And when you think about it, for a Jnani, like the erstwhile Vidyaranya, 
whose profound thinking Jaldhar extolls, relying merely on the sruti would 
be revolting. Rather his or her greater reliance on thought processes is 
what classifies him or her as a Jnani in the first place! There has to be a 
convincing enough reason why a reality beyond time, space and causation has 
to exist! Jaldhar, any thoughts?

 Of course, you missed point linking the two statements:
1. A dullard does well if he or she has the right attitude
2. A dullard can do well only if an intelligent agency is helping him or her
 Linking statement: In my arguments below, I said:
Now, while <<1. may be true due to the law: "you are what you think">> you 
can't deny
that the dullard would most likely not be resourceful enough to reach the 
high position he or she
is currently at. Hence the need for 2.
 I read a nice arugment by Swami Krishnananda of the Divine Life Society 
which tries to show that 'causality' is all in the mind. It does not touch 
reality. Maybe I can place it before this audience when I have access to it.
 Regards, Mahesh
