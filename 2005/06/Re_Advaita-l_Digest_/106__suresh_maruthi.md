Recently, in a well researched book on SriSuktha, "Kanakadhara stotra"
was indicated as Kalpoktha lakshmi stotra. I understand that there is
a view that some of the popular stotras attributed to Sri
Samkaracharya were not composed by him. Apparently there are leading
scholars who support this view.
I am keen to know as to the stotras actually composed by him.
