Namaste,
Indeed your saying that Acharya Shankara establishes his siddhaanta
based on rational lines (independent of Shruti or on rationalised
Shruti) is quite accurate. I refer the readers to a talk given by a
certain N Subramaniya Iyer with the approval of the Shringeri
Peethadhipathi HH Narasimha Bharathi Mahaswamiji during the early
1900's stating this very fact. He in fact decries the western authors
who had reduced Acharya Shankara to a theologian. This article was
published in the Tattvaloka magazine a few years ago.

Also I think that the Acharya has categorically stated:"Even if a
hundred shrutis say that fire is cold they cannot be accepted" (sorry
I cannot provide the source).

As far as science as a superior revealer of truth, so to speak, Swami
Virajeshwara in his book says that science goes along a parallel road
with religion (in this case advaita). Science bases its entire
findings on the assumption that the waking state is only real.
Actually not only science but all other philosophies do not count the
three states of waking, dream and deep sleep. Once the witness is seen
as Pure Awareness during these three states all the dualist theories
vanish! First know yourself then try to understand the world! This is
his point of view.

Abhishek
