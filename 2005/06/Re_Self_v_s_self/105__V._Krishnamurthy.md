"I saw the discussion on Self v/s self and although I
wanted to understand the thread, I seemed to miss the
context. Could someone kindly help me here
on what is the Self and whats self? Is it the Atma and
jivAtma?"


I am not able to locate the thread  that you are referring
to. Can you give me more specific reference?

PraNAms to all seekers of Truth.
