Pranams:

Another point of view on this verse could be that even a Jivan mukta 
occasionally "slips" down to a pure Sattvic state in order to live in the 
world and Krishna is exhorting Arunja to be established in this state. Swami 
Krishnananda in "Philosophy of the Pachadasi", pp84 writes:

 "An illumined soul has a deep consciousness whereby there arises an 
occasional feeling of the body and the world, simultaneously with the 
constant feeling that s/he is the Atman. This is possible due to his/her 
being in a state of Sattva, where there is a clear discernment of the 
presence of the original universality, though the limitation of the 
reflection is also felt together. Hence, while referring to bodily actions, 
the knower refers to the lower 'I' or Chidabhasa [i.e. Atman reflected in 
Sattvika Buddhi] and when feeling that s/he is the Absolute, s/he makes 
reference to the higher "I", or Kutastha".

Regards, Mahesh
