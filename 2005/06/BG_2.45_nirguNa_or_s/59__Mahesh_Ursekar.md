Pranams:
 Your knowledge on the Upanishads is clearly very deep and maybe the epithet 
of professor should have applied to you as well! :-)

>> prabhuji, as far as my understanding goes..world does not disappear the 
*wrong* knowledge (avidyA) 
>> about world (i.e. world has a separate existence apart from brahman) 
disappears.
 You are right, *wrong* knowledge disappears, not the world. But some 
reasons why I yet feel some sattva is present in the Jnani:
 1. Can you tell me how you interpret statements made by Guadapada that 
there is no creation and Brahman is the only reality? And as far as I know 
Sankara does agree with him. If the Jnani sees the world outside then isn't 
that creation in some sense? 
2. Sankara interprets the world as ignorance of seeing the rope in the 
snake. Isn't the Jnani seeing the snake *and* the rope if s/he posits 
Brahman and the world? In fact, according the later philosophers of Advaita 
the claim is made that the world appears like a dream when Brahman is 
realized. Sankara never said that. 
3. In the Mundaka Upanishad passage of the two birds, why does he chose the 
higher bird to be Isvara and not Brahman? I think it is to allude to the 
fact that a Jnani is above the world and a samaric is not.
 >> Advaita does not have any problem with saguNa brahman...as this
>> categorization of brahman as para (nirguNa) & apara (saguNa) been 
approved [...]
 I agree with all you said above. It is closer to my heart that you know.
 Humble pranams, Mahesh
