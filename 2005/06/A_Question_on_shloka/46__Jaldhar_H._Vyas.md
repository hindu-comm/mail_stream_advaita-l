I think it is significant this comes in the chapter called dhyanayoga.  It 
shows once again how the Gita takes Samkhya ideas and extends them to 
Vedantic conclusions.

The first is talking about a yogi who has reached the state of samadhi 
where there is calmness of mind and equilibrium of the three gunas.  This 
is reached by niyamas and other steps of rajayoga.  (See preceding 
shlokas.)

The second is talking about the yogi who has gone beyond pairs of 
opposites such as virtue and sin.  (This is the meaning of "free from sin")
In that state the world of three gunas is seen as only maya and only the 
infinite bliss of Brahman is experienced.

While the first path involves karma (the 8 steps of rajayoga,) the 
second requires jnana.
