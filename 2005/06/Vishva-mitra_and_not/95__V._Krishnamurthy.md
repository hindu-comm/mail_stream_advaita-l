Namaste
This is in reply to Praveen Bhatt's question.
I have read in one of Kanchi Mahaswamigal's lectures that
it is only Vishva-mitra; but by a peculiar freak of
grammatical exception it has become Vishvaamitra.  In fact,
he gives in that lecture a few more examples of such
grammatical freaks, but I don't remember it now.

PraNAms to all seekers of Truth.
