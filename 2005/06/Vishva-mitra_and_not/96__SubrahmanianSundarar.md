True.  For example, how does padma + vatI become padmAvatI it should be padmavatI.  So also there are some exceptions where the "a" elongates.  Another example is puShpAvatI.  I am not sure if it happens only with "matup" (vatup here) possessive endings.  The exceptions (apavAdAH) are listed in one of Panini's sutras.  I can get the number if you are serious about it.  Otherwise, the below explanation from ProfVK should be sufficient to get you going.

Namaste
This is in reply to Praveen Bhatt's question.
I have read in one of Kanchi Mahaswamigal's lectures that
it is only Vishva-mitra; but by a peculiar freak of
grammatical exception it has become Vishvaamitra.  In fact,
he gives in that lecture a few more examples of such
grammatical freaks, but I don't remember it now.

PraNAms to all seekers of Truth.
