Explanation given by Sri Jaldhar Vyas is the usually accepted meaning 
of Brahmarshi. If Brahma-jnanam were the criterion for calling someone 
a Brahmarshi, the whole Vishwamitra-Vasishtha episode would not carry 
any meaning. Apparently both were Brahma-jnanis but Vishwamitra 
excelled in other disciplines also. Vishwamitra's resentment centers 
around the fact that despite his superior qualifications than 
Vasishtha, he is not considered a Brahmarshi.
