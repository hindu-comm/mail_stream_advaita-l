Namaste Praveenji,

The word Brahma has several meanings. It can also mean 'the Veda'. Do
look at Shankara's commentary on the following verse from the Vishnu
Sahasranama for the various definitions:

brahmanyo brahmakrit brahmaa brahma brahmavivardhanah
brahmavid braahmano brahmee brahmagno braahmanapriyah

praNAm all,

Forgive my ignorance on this, please. Were Brahmarishi-s knowers of
Brahman
and therefore, jnani-s?

Maybe categories of Rishi-s would also help.

jai bajrangabali,
