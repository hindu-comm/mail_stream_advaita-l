>From the standpoint of Advaita Vedanta, our origin is in chitta or 
consciousness. Other explanations are possible.  Such as we originated 
from certain primordial amino acids which evolved over millenia into human 
beings.  But what does protein care about origins?  Without consciousness 
how could we say "I" come from x where x is anything?  So based on this 
answer to question 2, the answer to question 3 is the goal is to become 
pure consciousness.
