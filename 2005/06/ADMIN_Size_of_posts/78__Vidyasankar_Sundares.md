Dear all,

I see that the Spam filter has been discarding a few emails in the last two 
days from list members. I think this is due to the large size of each of the 
posts the filter decided to throw out, as this is the only common factor 
among all of them. Even if this is not the case, please keep the size of 
each individual post to a reasonable size.

Thanks,
Vidyasankar
