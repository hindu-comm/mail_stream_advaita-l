What makes you think an axiom has to necessarily be "simple" and
"intuitive"? Many branches of Mathematics have axioms that are
not at all "simple" and "intuitive".

Certain kinds of non-Euclidean Geometry consider the axiom:

"Given a line and a point not on the line, there exists more
than one line passing through the given point, that is parallel
to the given line."

Which is equivalent to:

"Parallel lines are not everywhere equidistant."

There is nothing whatsoever that is "simple" and "intuitive"
about the above axiom. In fact, the exact opposite ("parallel
lines are everywhere equidistant") is taught to all high school
students as Euclidean Geometry for the precise reason that it is
"simple" and "intuitive".
