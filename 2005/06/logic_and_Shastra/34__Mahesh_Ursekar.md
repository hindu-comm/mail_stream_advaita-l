Pranams:
 You have raised some interesting points but I do feel that if we continue 
this thread any longer it will be in establishing whether Brahman can be 
taken as an axiom or not. While it may be a good intellectual pursuit, it 
doesn't take us very far in the true spirit of this list i.e. understanding 
of the thoughts Adviata mainly thru Sankara's eyes but supported/refuted by 
thoughts from other disciplines/sciences if necessary. So, like Amuthan, 
before me, let me say that this will be my last post on this line of 
thought.
 One point 1.
 Are you trying to say that the maha-vakyas as axioms provides are 
self-consistent system to establish Advaita only? That they may not 
necessarily hold for Christianity and Islam. That the latter two have their 
own systems that need to be consistent but not necessarily overlap? I think 
that is too restricted a view - Advaita (according to me) spans every 
thought stream, irrespective of origination.
 On point 2:
 My axioms in arriving at Brahman are those that are those that don't need 
intellectual leaps to grasp. That does not mean I won't take recourse to 
Hiesenberg's uncertaintity principle, if required, though understanding it 
is probably as hard as understanding Brahman. But the former has been 
"proven" to be true to every rational thinking human being and it has 
started from the the "basic" non-quantum theories of science which are 
easier to establish. 
 On point 3:
 The self is self-evident and not the Self.
 Humble pranams, Mahesh
