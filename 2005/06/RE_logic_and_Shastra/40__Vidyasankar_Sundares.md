Regarding the word AtmA as self and Self,

I have been reflecting on this over the last few days, and am unable to see 
how the svara-s in veda chanting bear on this issue. Could you clarify?

Here is my problem. Take the taittirIya upanishat, for instance. There are 
only two possible ways of reciting the word AtmA.

One is as in the sentence, "anyo.(a)ntara AtmA ...mayaH", where "..." stands 
for prANa etc, up to Ananda. Here AtmA is recited so that the first "A" is 
at neutral pitch and the syllable "tmA" has a raised pitch.

The other is as in the sentence "tasyaiSha eva shArIra AtmA". Here, the 
first "A" is at a reduced pitch and "tmA" is at neutral pitch.

Both kinds of svara usage apply for each of prANamaya, manomaya, viGYAnamaya 
and Anandamaya. As far as I can see, it is not possible to correlate one 
svara usage with the little self and the other with the big Self.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
