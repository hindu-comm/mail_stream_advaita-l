I would be interested to know your sources and reasons for these sites. 
The evidence I've seen so far from Hindu and Buddhist tantric 
sources suggests the 4 pithas are aligned on the axis of the Himalayas and 
Odayana was either in the Swat valley area of what is now Pakistan or even 
Afghanistan.  (Both of which were culturally part of India in those days.)
