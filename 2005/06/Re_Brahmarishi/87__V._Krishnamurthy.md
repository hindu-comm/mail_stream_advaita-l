Different shastras give different lists.  One is Atri,
Bharadvaja, Gotama, 
Vasishtha, Vishvamitra, Jamadagni, and Bhrgu.  Some sources
say it is 
different in each manvantara (cycle of ages.)"

The Bhagavatam and Harivamsam together  have all the names
of the Saptarishis in the different Manvantaras. Each
Manvantara is a period of 71 x 4,320,000 human years within
one Cosmic Day of Creator BrahmA. Right now we are in the
seventh manvantara, called Vaivasvata Manvantara. The names
of the Saptarishis in the past six Manvantaras, and in this
seventh Manvantara as well as in the oncoming eighth
Manvantara are given below:

First Manvantara:(SvAyambhuva Manvantara): Marichi, Atri,
Angiras, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulastya and VasishTa.

Second (SvArochisha Manvantara): Urjha, Stambha, PrAna,
BRhaspati, Atri, Dattatreya and Chyavana.

Third (Uttama Manvantara): Pramada (son of VasishTa) and
six brothers of his.

Fourth (TAmasa Manvantara): JyotirdhAma, PRthu, KAvya or
ShukrAcharya, Chaitra, Agni, DhanDa and PIvara.

Fifth (Raivata Manvantara) : Hiranyaroma, Vedashira,
UrdhvabAhu, DevabAhu, Sudhama, Parjanya and MahAmuni.

Sixth (ChAkshusha Manvantara): Havishman, VIraka, Sumedha,
Uttama, Madhu, Atinama, Satishvan.

Seventh (Present)  (Vaivasvata Manvantara): Kashyapa, Atri,
VasishTa, VishvAmitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadwaja.

Eighth (Future)  (SAvarni Manvantara): Galava, Diptiman,
Parashurama (of whom we have heard in the Ramayana)
Ashvattama (son of Dronacharya), Kripacharya, Rishyasringa
and Vyasa.


Each Manvantara has a Manu, the Lord of all the human
kingdom. The present Manu is Vaivasvata. That is why this
Manvantara is called Vaivasvata Manvantara.  Each
Manvantara has an Indra who holds the office of the Ruler
of all devas for the period of the manvantara. The next
Savarni Manvantara will have Savarni as its Manu, and the
present Bali (who was overcome by the Lord in the Vamana
Avatar) as its Indra. 

Other basic details about these Manvantaras and the Cosmic
Day of Brahma are given in:
