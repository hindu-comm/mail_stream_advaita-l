Namaste,
Could someone give details reg the kind of individual each verse of
the Bhagavad Gita refers to? In the 5th chapter, for example, both
karma yoga and jnana yoga is referred to by Bhagavan Vasudeva. So who
actually is being addressed by Bhagavan?

By the way, Chandrashekara Bharati Mahaswamiji states that Arjuna was
qualified only for karma yoga. (Arjuna means pure mind). Still
Bhagavan expounded Samkhya and other paths to him. So according to His
Holiness, Gita is an universal scripture.
