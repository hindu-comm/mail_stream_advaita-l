Oh my God, that was a terrible grammatical lapse indeed!  Yes "He" refers 
to the non-tapasvi not to Shankaracharya.   Thanks.

Well I see it slightly differently.  See below.

Incidently I take AtmaprashaMsAdidoshhAdhyAropeNa to refer to Krishna 
Bhagavan.  The unqualified person isn't full of self-praise, he thinks 
Krishna Bhagavan is just out to praise himself.  In other words his sin is 
that he is projecting (Adhyaropa) defects onto the defectless Lord.

The reason I put it the way I did is to be found in the bhashya 
immediately after this part.  Shankaracharya says:

...tatra medhavine tapasvine va iti anayoH vikalpadarShanAt
shuShrUShAbhaktiyuktAya tapasvine tadyuktAya medhAvine vA vAchyam |

"On that, 'to a wise man or a tapasvi' mentioned in another text shows that 
there is an option between a tapasvi who is endowed with devotion and faith
or a wise man who is also endowed with those."

And in case we didn't get the point:

shuShrUShAbhaktiviyuktAya na tapasvine nApi medhAvine vA vAchyam |

"Neither the tapasvi nor the wise man who is without devotion and faith 
[should be taught the Gita]"

So assuming tapas = karma and medhA = GYAna (which I think is what 
Shankaracharya is getting at here.  I don't know where the quote is from.) 
it is possible to practice them independently but bhakti should be the 
foundation of both.  If it isn't then the prospective student of the 
Gita is ineligible regardless of other qualifications.
