I'm sure you had the right meaning in mind, but as you have stated it
would appear that Sankara himself believed that Krishna was a mortal with
faults!  Furthermore, upon reading the bhAshhya it is evident that the
commentator is not taking a position saying that one without devotion in
Guru and Bhagavan also lacks knowledge of Bhagavan's divinity.

Rather, the commentator holds these as separate, in the following manner:

1> one must not discuss the intimate teachings of the 'Gita with one who
is not a tapasvI, i.e., not given to austerities (atapaskAya, taporihitAya
na vachyam.h);

2> even a tapasvI who lacks bhakti in Guru and Bhagavan is not a candidate
under any circumstances (tapasvine.api abhaktAya gurau deve cha
bhaktirahitAya kadAchana kasyAJNchidapi avasthAyAM na vAchyam.h);

3> one who is a tapasvI and a bhakta also, but not "nurturing" is not a
candidate either (bhaktaH tapasvI api san.h ashushrUshhuH yo bhavati
tasmai api na vAchyam.h);

4> finally, one who does not recognize the divine nature of Vasudeva
(Krishna) and regards Him as a mortal human on account of (his own) flaws
such as self-praise, and is ignorant and intolerant of His nature of
Lordship, even such a person is unqualified and with him one must not
discuss these matters (na cha yo mAM vAsudevaM prAkR^itaM manushhyaM matvA
abhyasUyati, AtmaprashaMsAdidoshhAdhyAropeNa IshvaratvaM mama ajAnan.h na
sahate, asAvapi ayogyaH, tasmai api na vAchyam.h).

The commentator concludes that a person who is cognizant of the Lordship
of Bhagavan, who is a tapasvI, a bhakta, and a shushrUshhu, to him this
shaastra is to be stated/given: bhagavati anasUyAyuktAya, tapasvine,
bhaktAya, shushrUshhave vAchyaM shAstram.h -- iti.

Therefore, there are separate cases of disqualification, and lack of
devotion is not automatically considered to imply something else, etc.
