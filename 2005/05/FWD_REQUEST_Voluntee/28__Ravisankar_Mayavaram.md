blessings of the present AchArya-s. The term "Voice of God" is a
literal translation of the Tamil title "deyvaththin kural"

The Voice of God Project is an ambitious project seeking to translate
all the seven volumes of 'Deivathin Kural' in to English and several
Indian languages like Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Assamese, 
Oriya, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada. Each volume of Deivathin Kural 
is over a 1000 pages long.

The deadline for getting printed copies ready is January 14, 2006. To
meet this deadline our translations must be ready by October 15, 2005.

could be used as a base for other languages.

We need a team of translators who can translate Tamil to English and
subsequently from English to the other languages mentioned above.

translation work, please write immediately to R. Sridhar, Mumbai at
