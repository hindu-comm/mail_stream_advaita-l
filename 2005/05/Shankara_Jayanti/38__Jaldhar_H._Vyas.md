Today (Vaishakha Shukla 5) is Shankara Jayanti.  Let us all take some time 
in our busy day and honor the compassionate teacher of the entire world, 
who dedicated his life to freeing all beings from the bonds of ignorance.

Shankaracharyas' disciple Totakacharya composed a stuti in praise of his 
guru in 8 verses which is therefore called Totakashtaka.  You can find it 
on our website at http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/texts/totakashtaka.pdf. 
You will need Adobe Acrobat or some other PDF viewer to see it.
