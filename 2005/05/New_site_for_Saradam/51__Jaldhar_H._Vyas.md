Apart from this mailing list, one of the ways we seek to fulfill our 
mission of furthering knowledge of Advaita Vedanta and Smarta sampradaya 
is to host websites for others who share the same objective.  Thus I am 
pleased to announce a new site for Saradambal Seva Samithi Trust of 
Chennai at http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/sarada/

Apart from details of the Trust and the work it does. the site contains 
two e-books in PDF format:  Brahmasutra Shankarabhashya Sangraha which is 
as the name suggests is a compendium of the topics of Shankaracharyas' 
Brahmasutrabhashya and Advaitasiddhi Sara Sangraha which does the same for 
Swami Madhusudana Sarasvatis' monumental Advaitasiddhi.  They are the 
products of eminent scholars and well worth a look for any serious student 
of Advaita Vedanta.
