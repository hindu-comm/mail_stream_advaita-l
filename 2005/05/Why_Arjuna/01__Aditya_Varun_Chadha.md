Greetings,

> All I can say is that IT just happened like that.
At the risk of digressing, this brings us to the question of chance /
destiny. Surely if all is destiny (if everything is pre-arranged) then
there would be no reason for a gItA in the first place.

The very fact that mankind is blessed with the gItA and so many other
pearls suggests the existance of choice and thus chance. (otherwise
why profess?) But then, maybe all that happens (even the 'illusion of
chance') is just how it is "supposed to happen". Maybe within mithyA
(created universe) all that happens is simply inevitable. that in
retrospect we see choices, but in real time no such thing really
exists. But surely in brAhmaN-hood this question itself does not
arise.

What does the gItA and Sruti in general have to say about this?
