Hari Om,

So gItA 17.15 describes verbal tapas as having all 3 attributes:
satyam, pryahitam and anudvegakaram. Even if one of these three
elements are missing, it can't be considered verbal tapas. Could any
of the listmembers elaborate on this? In particular, it seems that
resolving the characteristics of 'good speech' is at the core of many
of a dilemma. Take yudhiShThira's aShvatthAmo hataH kunjaraH for
instance.

There are two parties involved in any act of communication - the
speaker and the audience. There may be one satya common to both
parties - think of us as being entitled to our set of opinions, but
not our set of facts. But when we say priyahitam and anudvegakara, is
it referring to the state of the speaker or the audience? Something
that is udvegakara to the audience may, in fact, be anudvegakara to
the speaker, no?
