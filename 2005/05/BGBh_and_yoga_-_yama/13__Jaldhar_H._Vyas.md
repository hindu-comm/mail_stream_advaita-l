In this context I am reminded of Gita 18.67

idaM te nAtapaskAya nAbhaktAya kadAchana |
na chAshushrUShave vAchyaM na cha mAM yo.abhsUyati || 67 ||

"This [gita] you should not ever teach to one who is not a tapasvi, not a
bhakta, does not want to listen and does not recognize me."

Shankaracharya explains such as person as one who is 
without faith in Guru and God.  He believes that Vasudeva [Krishna] is a 
mortal man with faults, and does not recognize his divine nature.  Such a 
person should not be taught the Gita.  Even if the speaker had the best of 
intentions, it would be undvegakara to speak about such things to such an 
obviously unreceptive audience.
