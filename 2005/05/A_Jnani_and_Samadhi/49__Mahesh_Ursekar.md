Pranams:
 It is said the a Jnani is continually in a elevated state of conciousness 
and has his or her ego reduced to near zero. However, in the lives of great 
sages like Sri Ramakrishna and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, their Samadhi 
experiences have been given significant if not greater importance. It is 
said that in that state they lost all outer conciousness and their bodily 
functions (like heart beat, etc) were barely functioning. Further, it is 
said the these seers returned to the state of "normal conciousness" after 
this experience. Can anyone elucidate the relation between a Jnani's state 
of awareness and the awareness experienced in Samadhi?
 Thanks, Mahesh
