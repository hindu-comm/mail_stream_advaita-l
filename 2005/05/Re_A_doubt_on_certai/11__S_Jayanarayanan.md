Thanks for the very informative posting on the difference
between the various Vedantic terms such as "manas", "Buddhi",
etc.

Just for the sake of comparison -- Western philosophy lumps
everything into one entity called "mind". But the mind itself is
said to consist of parts or aspects such as intelligence,
memory, emotions, etc. Therefore, the English word "mind" may
not be a direct translation of the Sanskrit word "manas", though
the two words may actually have had a common etymological root,
both being Indo-European.

There are lots of online resources in this regard, e.g:

For a general idea:
