is there any difference between words like
antaHkaraNa.m, chitta.m, manas or are they all the
same?

i would also like to know the differences and
similarities between terms like buddhi, vij~nAnam,
manas etc. 

i'm sorry for deviating from the main discussions, but
since these terms appear quite often in the gItA and
other works on yoga, a clear definition of these would
be extremely helpful.
