Namaste all.

Sorry that this series will be taking a break now. Recently
my mood has changed to an intense study of Shrimad
Bhagavatam.  I am not able to concentrate on YogAmRRitam
now. I shall get back to this series as soon as I can.
Thank you.

PraNAms to all advaitins on this list and to my father.
