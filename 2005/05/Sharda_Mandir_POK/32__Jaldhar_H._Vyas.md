Jaldhar H. Vyas <jaldhar at braincells.com>

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Namaste,
I found these photos of the Sharada Pitha (where Shrimad
Shankaracharya attained the seat of Wisdom after debating with so many
scholars)  located in Pakistan occupied Kashmir. If you find it fit
you can forward it to the group or put it on the home page. I remember
reading a few days ago that the Sringeri Math had requested the
authorities to allow pilgrimage to this spot.
Warning: The temple has beeen totally destroyed.
