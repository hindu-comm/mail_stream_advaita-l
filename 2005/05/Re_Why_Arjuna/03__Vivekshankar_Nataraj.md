Here is my two cents. According to tradition, Arjuna and Krishna are verily Nara and Narayana. In fact, one of the invocatory verses for Mahabharata  starts by paying  homage to this pair. Thus who better than Nara to expound Gita to.

NaRaYaNam NaMaskruthya NaRam Chaiva Narottamam
Devi Saraswathim Vyaso Thatho JayaMudhirthayet.


Sri KrshnarpaNamasthu
