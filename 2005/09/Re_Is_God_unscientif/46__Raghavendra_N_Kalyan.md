There is nothing incorrect in saying that God is unscientific. In advaita-vedAnta, brahman is known through upanishads and other Sruti and not by any scientific methods. All logical methods employed to show the existence of God have flaws in them. There is however nothing to be offended in the fact that brahman and God are unscientific. It is just that the methods of science or pure logic are insufficient in this realm.

Certain religious groups have problems with stem cell research or evolution. But I dont see why advaitins should be against evolution etc. In fact it would be extremely unwise to deny scientific theories in the face of overwhelming evidence.

I dont see how your claim in your first sentence follows logically from the examples that you have given. Again, I believe you are trying to find proof for the existence of higher powers by knowledge derived from sensory observation, which is incorrect.

I agree with you here. A scientist is entitled to hold his/her religious beliefs just as anybody else. People (especially many non-scientists) dont realize that. Scientific objectivity does not imply that a scientist cannot have his own personal religious beliefs. People like Einstein and Hawking had their own beliefs and no one can deny that they are objective scientists.

Raghavendra
