It would be nice to have the exact reference to the following
quote:

http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2000-May/000738.html

"shrii chandrasekhara bhaaratii of the shringeri maTha
is one of the greatest lights to adorn the piiTha...
a disciple of the maTha commented in
a complaining tune that a shrii vaishNava he knew had
an Advaitic experience. svaamiijii immediately
retorted 'Moksha is not the property of shrii
shankaraachaarya's disciples'. The disciple fell
silent."
