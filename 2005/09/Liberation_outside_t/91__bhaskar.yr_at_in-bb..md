Is there
liberation outside the Smarta Sampradaya or not?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

All are eligible for liberation...Liberation is neither achieving anything
new nor going to some exalted state nor it is a super natural experience of
an individual ...it is nothing but getting rid of ignorance about our true
nature...saMpradAya & traditional teaching help us to realize this truth in
a systamatic way...

Ofcourse, the above answer is within the advaita/smArtha saMpradAya
boundaries...you may get the different answer from different sampradAya
vAdins with regard to liberation & individuality of bonded souls.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
