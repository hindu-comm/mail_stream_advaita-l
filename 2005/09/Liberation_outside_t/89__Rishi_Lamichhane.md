Dear All,

I have never gotten a coherent answer to this question. Is there
liberation outside the Smarta Sampradaya or not? In addition, what
does it mean for an individual to be in the Sampradaya? For instance
those who have Sannyasin initiation from a member of the Sampradaya
but are not practicing the teachings of that particular tradition, I
assume such an individual would not be considered part of the
Sampradaya, right?

Regards,

Rishi.
