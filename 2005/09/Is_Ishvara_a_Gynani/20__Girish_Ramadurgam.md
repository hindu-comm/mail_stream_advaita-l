Dear Members,

I have a few question regarding Ishvara? On reading panchadashi my
understanding is Ishvara is reflection of self on Prakriti, the sattva
aspect of prakriti.

If it is so,

1) Doesnt Ishvara has more chances to realise Self than a Jiva?
2) If Ishvara has realised Self, then wouldn't Ishavara cease to
exists? Then would maya recreate Ishvara by its power?
3) If Krishna has realised Brahman then wouldn't we infer that Vishnu
knows the truth and would then cease to exists.(as Krishna is avtara
of Vishnu)?
4) So is Vishnu a role created by Maya to maintain it creation?

Thank you very much in advance for your help.

Best Wishes,

Girish
