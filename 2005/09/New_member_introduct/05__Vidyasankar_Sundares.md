I have been interested in philosophy from my college days when i used to 
attend talks by Sri J Krishnamurthi held in Mumbai. Later on i became 
associated with the Kanchi mutt and thus in close interaction with the 
sankaracharya for his guidance on advaita philosophy.
I have been able to go through some of the earlier emails from your archives 
after which I could not access your archives. Those articles made very 
interesting reading. I shall contribute my viewpoints (if required) as we 
proceed further.
Hope to receive your kind acceptance to my membership to your site.

With Best Regards
B. Shridhar
