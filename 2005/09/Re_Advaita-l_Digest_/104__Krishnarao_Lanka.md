Sub: - Importance of sannyAsa for study of VedAnta

Priya bandhujanAh.

Please excuse me for interfering amidst into the discussion. In this
connection, I wish to say, according to my knowledge goes, there are no
restrictions for any one to acquire any kind of knowledge. But for every
thing there are some conditions and norms. You will not allow your child,
who is just a student of elementary education, leaving his class books and
trying to read your physiology, anatomy, nuclear physics or the Apastambha
grihya sUtrAs.

It is because they are not essential for him at this stage. In the same way,
certain rules are there to know about the brahma vidya also.

 VyrAgya is a condition of several types, which arise out of vexation, due
to sufferings like prasUti vyrAgya (at the time of delivery) in females,
smaSAna vyrAgya when some beloved person dies, purAna vyrAgya when hearing
the discourses about Atma, paramAtma etc., from an expert orator,

Or kArana vyrAgya when ones own children and his wife disown him and not
hearing or following his commands. The real vyrAgya is quite different from
all these.

 The real virAgi becomes a sannyAsi. SannyAsa in other words was equalized
to death. There is a saying that we should never invite sannyAsa nor the
death. Also we should not be afraid of these both and try to escape from
them too. After taking sannyAsa, he will not have the choice to come back
again in to the grihasthAShram, or perform any karma kAnda. In fact the
presence of a sannyAsi is almost similar to a prEtatma. Many people do not
allow him to stay inside of their houses. Therefore our elders are always
discouraging us to take up sannyAsa AShram. One has to undergo so many tests
before he obtains permission for the sannyAsa diixa. We samsAriis should not
develop any idea which may create vyrAgya in our minds.

 We must have some knowledge and a trained mind associated with practices in
the guidance of some qualified and learned elder, to enter into any
philosophical books. There are so many purAnAs, dharma SAstras, etc., to
read before reading vyrAgya creating books. The guru will train your mind to
understand about vEdAnta. Those books should educate you towards GyAna, but
not the transitory vyrAgya.

 Wise people do no advise to read Bhagavadgiita also, (though it is widely
popularized by a sect of people) because it belongs to samhArakrama.

That book is intended for sannyAsis; and it is useful to pArAyan when any
person in the family dies. The result after Srikrishna taught it to Arjuna,
caused for the death of eighteen akShohinis of human beings. It is better to
read sundarAkAnda of rAmAyana which is in the srishtikramam. After tracing
out the jaganmAta, all the vAnarAs could enter into the Madhuvana and could
drink the nectar there with joy and pomp. It is also better to read durga
saptasati which is in the sThiti kramam, where it is described as after the
death of Sumbh and niSumbha, "tatah prasannamakhilam hatE tasmin durAtmani |
jagat swAsthya

matiivApa nirmalan chABhavannaBhah || and also the apsarAs danced with
myrth, the Sun glowed more brighter, the winds passed pleasantly,

"jajjwalu schAgnayah SAntAh Santa digjanita swanAh ||. The dEvi herself gave
so many promises to protect us from all the calamities and hardships. ( of
course this also needs some training to start reading the book )

 In summary , what I wish to say is, first of all seek a qualified and wise
guru. He will tell you what are to be learnt first and what next. You are no
doubt fully entitled to read all the upnishads, brahma sUtrAs,
Bhagavadgiita, and also all the vEdas under the guidance of a guru
irrespective of your caste etc., Our way of education is kramavidya. It is
power packed with systematic sounds which will certainly endow us all
required benefits if properly used; and also cause disasters if they are
misused.

 Sriparasukhanandanadha.
