HH Chandrasekhara Bharati of Sringeri quotes the shAstras as
"saMnyasya shravaNam kuryAt.h" - "Study the Vedanta after taking
Sannyasa". Not sure where this verse appears though. The dialog at
the link below explains why HH also taught that study of Vedanta is
only for sannyAsins:

When I asked the question regarding the teaching of upanishhads in
Veda PAThashAlas, I got the reply that in R^igveda and atharvaveda
adhyayana, upanishhads are not taught. Only students in sAma and
yajur veda are taught their upanishhads. Anyway, that still doesn't
explain why these two shAkhAs teach upanishhads to BrahmachAris.

Does Shankara anywhere explicitly say that gR^ihasthas in general
(not special isolated cases, which are considered exceptions to the
general rule) can also study VedAnta?
