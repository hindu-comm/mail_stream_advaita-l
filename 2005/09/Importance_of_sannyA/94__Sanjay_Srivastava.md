Some AchAryas actually hold this view. I remember visiting devAnanda
swami of uttar kashi in my college days and he maintained that study
of vedAnta by gruhasthas would give them pApa. He would discourage his
gruhastha students from coming to his vedAnta classes that typically
started at 3:00 AM in the morning and were finished by sunrise.The
only exception he made was for Gita which he taught in the evenings
and considered appropriate for everyone.

Late paramAchArya of Kanchi and previous shringeri AchArya held that
the  study of vedanta by gruhasthas would at best give them some punya
but not brahma-jnAna. Apparently, there are others who do not take
such charitable view.

And therefore later AchAryas such as Swami Vidyaranya had to clarify
that even a brahma-jnAni cannot be a jivanmukta unless he takes up
sannyAsa.

True that the mental state, and not the physical appearance is the
essence of sannyAsa. However it does not follow that physical
appearance is dispensable.
