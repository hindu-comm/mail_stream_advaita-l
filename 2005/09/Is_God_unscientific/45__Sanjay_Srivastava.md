The mImAmska position is that if shruti contradicts experience, it
should be re-interpreted. In the fields of dharma or moksha, shruti
reigns supreme since no experience can ever contradict it. For
example, vedas declare that performance of certain animal sacrifices
gives us punya. Personally I may abhor animal sacrifices. But is there
any way for me to prove or disprove that it does not give me punya?
Based on my faith in shruti, I can take it or leave it, but there is
no middle ground.

However, if vedas said something about anatomy of sacrificed animal,
would that also be beyond other pramANas? Certainly not. My experience
can confirm or contradict such declarations and shruti may need
reinterpretion based on the rules of mImAmsa.

..and therefore if they contradict shruti, it only shows that our
interpretation of shruti was faulty.

Feeling shy of reinterpreting shruti in the face of a contradictory
experience is not showing any respect to shruti, but going directly
against the tradition it upholds.

Let us also not rob the validity of other pramANas. When Vedanta
accepts certain pramANas as valid, it does not rank them in the order
of validity.  Shruti is neither superior nor inferior to other
pramANas. It has just a different jurisdiction. And if there is any
doubt about its jurisdiction, there is always the pUrva-mImAmsa to
help us out.
