I assumed he meant li~Ng (which I since found out is called imperative 
in English.)

Oh I agree but as Anand points out in the message you referenced, the 
"meaning" is connected to an action.  There is no relevant meaning outside 
of an action.  To restate what I was trying to say, if you know the 
linguistic, grammatical, form of a mantra, it is still won't help you 
understand Dharma unless you know the action it refers to.

However the Mimamsaka would emphasize: There do not exist any mantras that 
do not have an associated action.
