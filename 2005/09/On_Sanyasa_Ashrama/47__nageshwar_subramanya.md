Namaskaram s

Dear Sir when a Bramhachari takes sanyasa he will not put Atma Pinda .
He says while satanding in water he takes out all the vastras ,yajnopavitam ,(hairs only Head & Beard ) then he says  I am no ones for me no one is there ( AHAM BRAHMASMI ) Only if Mother comes he does namaskaram s..

Birthday is called as vardhanti if sanyasi is Alive Vardhanti Means (More or Grow)that also we have to do for Him because we have given him a name as Jagadguru so we have to learn more    ( Here we means Shishyas ) what we haveto learn the sadhana for Moksha marga 
we celebrate their Birthday ,and one who is not alive called as jayanthi for Ex Shankara Jayanthi .......

If Sanyasi leaves his body (Dies ) we  Bury him for our benefit it is called as Adhistanam.because when their aradhana comes we pray them for our children or for us only how was he you can see a picture but there is a statue of him ,and lingam is there so you can do abhisheka ,pooja .etc.

Thx Nagesh

My 2 cents:

Another example is at death (of the physical body.) We bury a sannyasi.
The vrndavans or burial sites often become places of pilgrimage. In
Gujarat the custom is to raise a Shiva lingam over the grave and many
prominent shivalayas started this way.

When even for an ordinary person we cremate because the body is worthless
after the soul has departed, why this emphasis on the body for one who has
disassociated himself from all it represents?

I think it is for our own benefit. These observances remind us that
even the Devas and other lordly beings are jealous of those who achieve
the rare and precious gift of a human birth.

In another thread we discussed miracles. It is natural that people would
be awed by a miracle like a murti crying. But isn't the biggest miracle
that anything exists at all instead of void? And that existence is not
chaos but follows an order that mortal beings can understand. And that
these mortals can learn the liberating shastra that can free them
from the pain of samsara. These are also miracles that sadly we often
take for granted.
