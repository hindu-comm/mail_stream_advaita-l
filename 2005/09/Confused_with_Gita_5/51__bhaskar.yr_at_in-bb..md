because of bringing in nirguNa brahmaN with karma yoga

praNAms
Hare Krishna

The *word* brahman can be interpreted in multiple ways...Here in this
context I think Lord does not talking about nirguNa nirAkAra brahman.
*Ishwara* is the more appropriate meaning for *brahman* here.  It is
vyavahArika satya that jIva entangled in BMI & bear the fruits of karma &
Ishwara is karma phala dAta.  IshvarArpita bhuddhi or Ishwara praNidAna is
what lord intended to convey in this verse.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
