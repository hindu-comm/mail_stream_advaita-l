namo nArAyaNAya!

dear SrI bhAskar and list members,

i'm sorry to come in abruptly into the conversation.
i'll just comment on two points.

asfaik, we have absolutely no rights to relax the
vidhi-s in SAstram eventhough we do them only for
chitta Suddhi. As long as one has not taken up
sannyAsam, one should meticulously adhere to the
various do-s and dont-s mentioned in the SAstra-s.
this is also made clear by SrI kR^ishNa who clearly
asks arjuna to perform actions for attaining chitta
Suddhi with the following words: 

"tasmAcchAstraM pramANaM te kAryAkArya vyavasthitau.
j~nAtvA SAstravidhAnoktaM karma kartumihArhasi.."
(gItA, 16.24) 

the arguments i have given above r based on SrI
Sa~NkarAchArya's commentary on this bhagavadvachanam.

i'm no expert to answer this and i leave it to the
experts for a proper answer. but i remember seeing in
Sa~Nkara's commentary on bR^ihadAraNyaka upanishad
that a karma can be substituted by a meditation on it
(i think this comes in the context of eulogising the
aSvamedha yaj~na). 

one important question i have is : "is the SAstram
mentioned by kR^ishNa above vedam or smR^iti?, i.e. is
it applicable only to vaidika karma-s or also to
smArta karma-s?"

i request the experts in pUrva mImAmsa to address this
issue.
