Thank you for this information Jayanaryanan ji. Yes, we are so ignorant of Vaidik vidhis. Today most of us are ruing over the fact but that is like locking the stables after the horses have fled. There was a news item on the TV yesterday about how a Vaidik Institution in South India is somehow scraping through despite financial crisis. 

South India has always been the bastion of Vedic rituals. But modern education has almost ensured the end of that era. I am on this group purely because I like the holy company of people who try to keep the flame alive.

Regards,
Jagannath.
