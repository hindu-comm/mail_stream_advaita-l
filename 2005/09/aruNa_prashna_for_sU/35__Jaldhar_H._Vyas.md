No mantras are vidhis.  Mantras are mantras.  The problem is in
Krshnayajurveda which most South Indian Brahmanas follow and of which
aruNapraShna is a part, the mantras and Brahmanas (explanations of mantras
which include vidhis) are mixed together unlike in other shakhas.  (There
is a rather unappetizing explanation of this in the Puranas considering
Maharshi Yajnavalkya having vomitted them up after arguing with his Guru.)

To recognize a vidhi you have to know Sanskrit grammar.  The vidhi is a
statement in the tense called li~Ng (sorry don't remember what its called
in English.) which enjoins an action should be performed.  The classic
example is svarga kamo yajeta "one who desires heaven should sacrifice"
This is a vidhi because it enjoins a particular action (sacrifice) by
which a particular outcome (heaven) can be achieved by a particular
actor (one who desires heaven.)

The counterpart to a vidhi is a niShedha which prohibits the performance
of some action.
