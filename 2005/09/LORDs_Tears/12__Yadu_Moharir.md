Namaste:



He is probably crying because we consider we worship him as dvaita and fail to cross this fundamental barrier.



gaNesha is the divinity of knowledge.



All the names of our iconic names are NOUNS all we as saadhaka need to recognize the corresponding associated attributes the icon represents and utilize them in our lives as VERBS.



Everything begins with the existing knowledge, sustained by the knowledge and then everything dissolves/merges in to the refined knowledge.  At some point in time the bhakta is supposed to become knowledgeable but if he remains trapped in the "Rituals and Miracles" then the saadhaka has to continue suffer.



By recognizing these miracles we are creating more "andhashraddhaa" rather than shraddha.



Miracle is in living true to your own conscious in this vyavahaaric life for the benefit of self, society, and humanity but certainly not in the "choo-mantraa ...." of a Guru or Gods.



Regards,



Dr. Yadu

Dear Taina,

Namaste. I really can't say anything about this miracle but the Discovery channel has carried episodes where similiar miracles have been studied. I hope you remember about the statue of the crying virgin Mary? She cries blood it seems and the scientists say it is blood. Also they have carried episodes about eerily preserved bodies of Saints. And again the shroud of Christ.

Many things cannot be really explained. However such miracles are for converting the non believers and also for increasing the devotion of the believers. In some cases they are also for increasing the revenue of the priests.

It is best to stay away from such miracles, except for pure intellectual curiosity, and stick to your own path. Advaita has no place for such miracles. Maya is perplexing enough.

Love & Regards,
Jagannath.
