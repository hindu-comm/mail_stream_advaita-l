Dear Taina,

Namaste. I really can't say anything about this miracle but the Discovery channel has carried episodes where similiar miracles have been studied. I hope you remember about the statue of the crying virgin Mary? She cries blood it seems and the scientists say it is blood. Also they have carried episodes about eerily preserved bodies of Saints. And again the shroud of Christ.

Many things cannot be really explained. However such miracles are for converting the non believers and also for increasing the devotion of the believers. In some cases they are also for increasing the revenue of the priests.

It is best to stay away from such miracles, except for pure intellectual curiosity, and stick to your own path. Advaita has no place for such miracles. Maya is perplexing enough.

Love & Regards,
Jagannath.
