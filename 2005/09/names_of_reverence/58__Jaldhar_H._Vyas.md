Different names describe different things.  It's no different in England
where knight, baronet, esquire etc. refer to different types of nobility
only some of whom are addressed as "sir"

Swami is the generic address for a sannyasi.  Muni is the same thing but
used mainly by Jains for their sadhus.  Many Dashanami sannyasis are
organized into groups called akhadas which actually functioned as military
regiments at one time.  Mahamandaleshwar is a title of an officer of one
of those akhadas.  Giri is one of the 10 orders of Dashanami sannyasis,
Shankaracharya is a title used by those who are in the direct line of
disciplic succession to Adya Shankaracharya.
