Namaste.
 >I just finished reading a ten-page commentary on the first
shloka of Narayaneeyam with a commentary called
Bhaktaranjani.

 Can you please tell me where I can get this commentary on the Narayaneeyam,
Sir? I would be happy to get the original Malayalam commentary as well. So
if you have any information on that, could you please pass it on to me?
Thanks very much.
 Pranams,
Meenakshi
