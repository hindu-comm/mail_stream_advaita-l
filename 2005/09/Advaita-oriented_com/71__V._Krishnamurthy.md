Namaste

I just finished reading a ten-page  commentary on the first
shloka of Narayaneeyam with a commentary called
Bhaktaranjani. This is from a Malayalam commentary of the
whole of Narayaneeyam  done in the 30's now translated in
English by four devotees who are well-versed in English. I
enjoyed reading it so much that I want to recommend the
whole book (which must be, I suppose, in the same style --
if I go by the Foreword given by Swami Shri Dayananda
Saraswathi. It has got word by word meanings, elaborate
commentary on almost every word and expression with profuse
quotations from Upanishads and other scriptures.  On the
whole it is a treasure for all students of Vedanta. Members
of the advaitin list and of advaita-L may remember how we
enjoyed reading just 36 selected shlokas, put together and
entitled 'Advaita Bhakti through Contemplative Practice of
Narayaneeyam'.

Have a taste of Bhaktaranjani by sampling from the
following:
