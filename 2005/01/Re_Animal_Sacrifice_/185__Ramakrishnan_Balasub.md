Thanks for the reference to Nakamutra. Can you quote a reference to
Nakamuras study of the authorship of the vivaraNa? A mere translation
is not of much use.

I am quite aware of Leggetts study. I quoted it in my first mail. I
have pointed out already that Halbfass has shown many defeciencies in
the study. You can look at "Tradition and Reflection".

No, I am giving it as an example that just because Mahasannidhaanam
expresses interest in a book, does not mean he approves *all* the
content or that the book should have been written by Sankara.

Why should a book *allegedly* by Sankara, not accepted by the
tradition at all, and not accepted by any indepth study by even
Western scholarship, have any validity?
