Namaste,
Are the mImAmsa sutras still extant? I had read
somewhere that they contain 1000 "sections" as opposed
to 192 "sections" of the Brahma sutras. Also I
understand that advaita could be considered as a
"modified" purva mimamsa bcos of the importance put on
karma for non-sannyasis by Shrimad Shankaracharya (as
in the Gita Bhashya). 

Regards,
Abhishek
