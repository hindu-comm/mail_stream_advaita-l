Hari Om,

I have had a similar experience with vibhuti on my forehead. Since I 
spent most of my 3 year US stay in South Carolina, I found that the 
people there were politely curious as opposed to people 
elsewhere(upstate NY,Philadelphia,etc) who were amused/thought I was an 
extra-terrestrial!
On one hand, if you notice Christian customs in USA, there is custom of 
applying ash on one's forehead during the holy day of "Ash Wednesday". I 
think most Christians would identify with the vibhuti custom if it is 
compared to their ash custom.

On a personal note, I feel, the choice of being self-conscious or not is 
quite subjective.

Hari Om,
Navin
