Jaldhar, I put a bit of vibhUti on my forehead and went to a grocery
store in the US, and people looked at me as though I came in from Mars!
A few even commented on "something stuck on my forehead". I'm talking
about just a tiny stripe, and even that generated reaction. Needless to
say, I haven't repeated that action for a long time now! Of course this
depends on how self-conscious one is, and one's capacity to handle
comments from passers-by.

In India, that's quite all right, but not so in the West.
