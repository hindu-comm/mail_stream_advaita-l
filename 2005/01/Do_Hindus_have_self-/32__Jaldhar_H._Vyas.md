Punishing the wicked is not to be done for yourself only but as a public
service.  That same Tamil Nadu government that can find the time to harass
saints, has by many accounts I've read done an appalling job of helping
the tsunami victims.  (Thank God for the many private charities, foreign
and domestic which rushed to the rescue.) In both cases the cause is the
same, high-handed politicians who think the people exist to serve them
rather than the other way around.
