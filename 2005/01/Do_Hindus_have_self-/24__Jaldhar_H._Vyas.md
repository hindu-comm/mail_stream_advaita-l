In the US the persons involved would be sued for civil rights violations.
Can this be done under Indian law?

Did you read what the Judge said when granting Swami Jayendra bail?  That
the prosecution have completely failed to show a case.  Far from being a
power grab, this is the last gasp of a failing dictatorship.  The same
kind of petty harassment occured during the last days of Eastern European
communism too.  It's a shame that Swami Vijayendra has to suffer through
this but in a few days the government will have egg on its face again.

In the mean time do you keep Shikha?  Do you wear tripundra and rudraksha
mala?  Do you study shastras?  This is our revenge on our enemies.
