I do the full tripundra only in shravana and during utsavas (it is the
family tradition to do it this way) and normally I just have a round
tilaka of kumkum.  I spend most of my time in New York where people see
ten times more weird things everyday :-) But even in rural areas where
there is no Indian community I can't say it's been a problem.  Sure,
people are curious but that's hardly the same thing as hostile.  Actually,
the question I usually get is "does it mean you are married?"  Apparently
many people know that Hindu women wear kumkum when they are married.
Which reminds me, why does the so-called "weaker sex" not feel so
self-conscious?

I also often see people wearing urdhvapundra (the vaishnava tilaka)  They
are Gujarati followers of Swaminarayana sampradaya.  Their attitude is
this is what Bhagavan wants so the rest of the world be damned.  An
attitude we could learn from.

Kartik, I must take you task for this insult to what are overall some of
the most tolerant and generous people in the world.
