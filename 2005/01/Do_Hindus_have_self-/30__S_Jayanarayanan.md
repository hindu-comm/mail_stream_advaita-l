My experience was limited to Texas, where people are neither as
conservative as the south-east, nor as liberal as the north of the US.
I haven't tried doing the same thing in California where I now live,
maybe the experience would be quite different. But I do agree that
Americans in general are very tolerant people.

I had no problems when I visited Malaysia, since most of the Hindu
population there walk freely with the tripunDra everywhere, and the
locals understand the custom well.
