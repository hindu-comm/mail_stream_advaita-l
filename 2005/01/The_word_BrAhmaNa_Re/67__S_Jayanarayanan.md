AFAIK, there are two meanings for the word "BrAhmaNa":

1) Male belonging to the priestly caste -- *both* birth and conduct
need to be taken into account. The dharma shAstras themselves say (e.g.
BaudhAyana), "One who does not study the scriptures, does not perform
the sandhyA worship and agnihotra, even if he be born into a BrAhmaNa
family, is to be considered a shUdra."

2) Knower of Brahman- The jIvanmuktiviveka says (I forget the exact
page), "In certain contexts, the word BrAhmaNa refers to the Knower of
Brahman."
