"like a shudra"  If the definition of Brahmanahood was purely ethical than
numerous examples of "bad brahmanas" like Ajamila, Aswatthama, etc. would
be oxymorons.  For that matter, there are morally superior Shudras.  So
perhaps this quotation is not so much passing judgement but stating a
simple fact.

Yes this is true.  The context should make the usage clear in most cases.
