None of the above seems to be a valid reason for
ignoring them. That they came later is well known.
However, I dont think that would mean they are not
authoritative or to be discarded.

Agama-s have authority of their own in their sphere.

Shankaracharya also authored the Prapanchasara which
is commented upon by Padmapadacharya himself.

Please see the Brahma Sutra Bhasya.

Smriti is merely a recollection of what was practiced
in ages past. Shankaracharya seems to quote smriti in
a number of places.

The restriction is only on reciting veda-s as mantra-s
and on officiating and performing yAgA-s etc. Everyone
can study the bhasya-s and understand them. This is
made clear in this list too.

 The position of Manu is very clear on this issue.

Btw a small correction in earlier post.

I meant that I will write offline to any response for
my last posting.
