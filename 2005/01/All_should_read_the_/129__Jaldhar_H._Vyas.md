Not knowing the Taittereya aranyaka I can't comment on that specific
passage perhaps someone else might want to, but as you are no doubt aware
apaurusheyatva extends to the samhitas, brahmanas, aranyakas, and
upanishads.  Prior to the 19th century, no Indian thinker thought
otherwise.

Ok, then I agree with you.

Because I thought you were refering to the creator--Ishwara, saguna Brahman.

I'm glad you brought up the subject of the Jews.  For those who don't
know, there are three strains of Judaism.  There are the Orthodox who
strictly maintain all the traditions.  There are the Reform who believe in
"changing with the times" and have abandoned the comittment to tradition
and the Conservatives who in theory try and steer a middle course between
the two but in practice are indistinguishable from reform.

Fully 47% of non-orthodox jews marry out of their faith.  While they may
make token gestures at their heritage by e.g. having an "interfaith"
ceremony, _98%_ of the children of such marriages do not consider
themselves Jewish.  Together with low birthrates (correlated to lack of
institutional and family ties) the American Jewish population is
_shrinking_.  The Orthodox on the other hand, while still the smallest
variety, are growing.  This is due in part to high birthrates but also to
their far greater success in passing on their values through the
generations.  Furthermore there is a growing movement of Jews disaffected
with the watered-down religion they grew up with becoming Orthodox.

It's the same in other religions.  In Great Britain more people attend
masjids than the churches of the official (and very liberal) sect.  But
other stricter forms of Christianity are doing ok.  I need not mention the
state of affairs in Islam.

And may I point out the "modern" era of Hinduism was ushered in by
Ramamohana Roy whose Brahmo Samaj as their very first act scandalized
Bengali society by giving janoi to a woman and having her read from the
Vedas.  Have you heard from the Brahmo Samaj lately?

It's not about political conservatism vs liberalism.  It's that religions
have to maintain a balance.  If they are too rigid and unwilling to
change, they decline.  But if they teach a wishy-washy "everyone should be
good" philosophy they fail to foster a commitment amongst their followers
and also decline.  I think our Dharma has lasted this long because it
overall does strike a balance between repression and "anything goes."  We
tinker with that balance at our peril.

But it's not just us, everyone throughout history has done so.  Even those
female Rshis themselves.

Well, personally I do actually think such people did exist.  But I must be
honest and say I don't know for sure.  So my suppositions on the subject
cannot be a firm basis for Dharma.  But I do know my parents exist.  I do
know figures like Shankaracharya existed because there is independent
evidence from history and their is a line of disciples that exist to this
day.

Yes.  The emphasis should be that other interpretations did exist in the
past but they fell by the wayside.  The Yajnika interpretation won out and
it is the basis of our living dharma.
