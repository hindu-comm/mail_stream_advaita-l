Dear Friend

Please be very careful while quoting Christian mystics in this forum. 

I understand your good intentions; however, please be warned that 
Christian mystics point to very different meanings of the words that could 
be used while tranlating Vedantic texts into English. 

For example, Vedantic take on "simplicity" and "purity" (quoted by you) pointing to the 
undivided oness of Atman cannot be further away from the Christian interpretation of both words meaning humble understanding of the eternal nothingness of creation in respect to his Creator, that cannot be removed.

Regards
