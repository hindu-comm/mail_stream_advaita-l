praNAm,

Dhanyavaada Shri Parasukhananda Nadha ji & Shri Aniruddhan ji, for your kind

words of explanation.

Since kAnchi paramAchArya had written in Hindu Dharma that in today's age,
the 
least a brAhmaNa could do is learn his veda ShAkhA, I was keen to know more.
The confusion, as seen from the questions that I asked earlier, is no longer
a problem now.

jai bajranga bali,
--praveeN
