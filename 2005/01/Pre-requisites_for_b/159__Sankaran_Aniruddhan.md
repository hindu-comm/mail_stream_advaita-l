It would be fair to say that the subject matter of focus in the vedas and 
vedanta is different, however I feel it is a big stretch to say that they 
have no connection at all.

Now, maybe some commentators did not quite say in so many words that you 
need to study the vedas before vedanta, however it is quite possible that 
they assumed it as given i.e. it was so common and implicitly understood 
that they did not feel the need to spell it out. But theoretically, you can 
take sannyasa from any ashrama in life, so that should include before 
upanayana as well (when no vedic study has been undertaken). Maybe it is not 
a hard and fast rule - one example is that of women. They have traditionally 
not studied the vedas, but many of them have taken up sannyasa.
