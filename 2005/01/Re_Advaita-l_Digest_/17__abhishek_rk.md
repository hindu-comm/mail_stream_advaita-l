The mImAMsA sUtras (technically, the pUrva mImAMsA
sUtras) are indeed quite 
extant and have been studied extensively, both by
traditional pundits and 
modern scholars. I am not sure about the number of
topics discussed in them, 
but please note that the 192 sections (the technical
Sanskrit term is 
adhikaraNa) of the brahmasUtras are according to the
advaita vedAnta 
tradition. Other vedAnta traditions number the topics
of the brahmasUtras 
differently.
