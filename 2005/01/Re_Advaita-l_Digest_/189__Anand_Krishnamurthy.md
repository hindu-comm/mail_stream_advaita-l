Respected Shri Jaladhar Ji,

>>>>>As per the Mimamsa shastra (and Advaitins concur)
the Vedas are not the words of the creator. They are
apaurusheya and preceded the creator.

What sense am I to make of this? If they are
apaurusheya and preceded the creator, how is that tied
to the concept of a nirguna brhman?
