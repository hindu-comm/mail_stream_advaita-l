If you note VAchaspati Mishra's commentary, every time he disagrees
with Shankara, he provides **quotes from shruti and smR^iti** that bear
out his view. 

VAchaspati Mishra doesn't say, "I disagree with Shankara because I
don't like what he is teaching", which is blasphemy!

Can you please provide reasons for the above assertion?

Shankara's teachings are nothing but shruti + smR^iti + logic.

But you do see that if your reasoning goes against shruti and smR^iti,
it cannot be accepted.

According to strict pUrva mImAmsA, the chanting of the Vedas is not the
Vedas per se, but is only the "manifestive agency of the Vedas".
