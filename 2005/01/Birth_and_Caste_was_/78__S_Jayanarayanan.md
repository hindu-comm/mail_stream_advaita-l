The practical problem with accepting Vedic study not based on birth is
(besides the fact that some smR^itis do say that it is based on birth):

How many pandits do you know who are scholars of the Vedas and
practising VaidIka dharma *full-time*, but are not BrAhmaNas by birth?

For quite sometime now, the Vedas have been propagated by the Arya
Samaj and other organizations to everyone high and sundry. Have you met
even one person from any of these organizations who has adhered to
vaidIka dharma all his life? Everyone I know who studied the Vedas from
such places abandoned it within a few weeks, so obviously studying the
Vedas was only a fad for them. Vedic teaching did not have a lasting
effect on these students at all, and they're all freely eating meat,
drinking wine, and living their life without any regard for dharma.
When the topic of the Vedas comes up, they say, "Oh yeah, I've tried
that too, it was cool!"

If the Vedas were a "study if it is your choice" program, there
wouldn't be any dedicated students. The Vedas have been preserved for
such a long time only because they were restricted by birth to the
dvijas, especially BrAhmaNas.
