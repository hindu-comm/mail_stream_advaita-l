namaste,

I have attempted a transliteration of the shloka that shrI jaladhar had
sent out. Jaladahar, please pardon me if your transliteration scheme
does not match mine.

Om agniriti bhasma vAyuriti bhasma jalamiti bhasma sthalamiti bhasma
vyometi bhasma sarva(ga)m ha va idam bhasma mana etAni cakShUgamshi
bhasmAni |
