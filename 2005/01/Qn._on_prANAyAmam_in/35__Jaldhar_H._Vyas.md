Thereare various varieties of pranayama so we cannot necessarily say which
is right or wrong.  For what it is worth, this is how I was taught to do
pranayama in sandhyavandana

puraka - 7 vyahrtis each preceded by omkar
kumbhaka - Gayatri itself
rechaka - Gayatri shirah

The approximate ratio of the three parts is 1-2-1
