namaste,

I believe other traditional ratios are 1:2:1 or 1:3:1. I have not been 
taught a specific relative duration, but we do recite a mantra during the 
pranayama, and I have been told which parts of the mantra should be recited 
during puraka etc. Maybe the relative durations for reciting work out to be 
the same as the traditional ratio.

puraka: Om bhuh...
kumbhaka: gayatri mantra (tatsavitur...)
rechaka: Om Apo jyoti...

Aniruddhan
