Actually, looking at the brahmasutrabhashya it seems samkhya/yoga gets the
brunt of the attack. I think its because its philosophical interests
encroach the most upon Vedantic territory.  With Purva Mimamsa, Shankaracharya
refutes their attempts to overreach their opinions into areas they
don't belong but most of P.M. doesn't overlap with Vedanta so it can be
tolerated.  The same approach can be seen in his treatment of Vaishnavism
and Shaivism.  He criticizes those doctrines which are contrary to the
Vedas but has no problem with the practical forms of worship they suggest.
