Yes I think so.  Shankaracharya distinguishes between the purely
instinctual reactions of the body (hunger, thirst etc.) and actions done
with volition.  It is the embodies presence of the atma which allows the

Because Chitta is Brahman itself?  Shankaracharya is adamant that there is
no connection at all between Brahman which is of the form of jnana or
chitta and action of any kind.
