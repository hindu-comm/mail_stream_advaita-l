Dear Sirs,

I have been a regular subscriber for the past 4 years. Off late I have found that your mails are not reaching me. I later got a mail from you that mails to my id are bouncing off and hence a re confirmation is required. I had sent you the reconfirmation back to you, however, it has also come back saying that the re confirmation has expired.

Will you please re activate my subscription.

Thanks & Regards

R Krishnamoorthy
