I have a question on the mantra used for the last arghya pradaanam in
sandhya worship:

sakala doshha praayashchittaartha ekaarghyapradaanam karishhye . 

But surely that doesn't literally mean that all sins are washed off
with just one arghya?

I believed that it must be interpreted to mean, "This is a repentance
for those sins that have undoubtedly crept into my actions, in spite of
my utmost care in attempting to follow dharma immaculately."

Am I correct in my belief? If not, what is the right interpretation?

Thanks,

Kartik
