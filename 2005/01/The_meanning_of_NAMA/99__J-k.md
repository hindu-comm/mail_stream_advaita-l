Dear Friends/List

Could you please give me the meaning/translation, possible closest to the original of the greeting "Namaste."

One of the books renders it in this way:

I honour that place in you where the entire universe resides; where, if you are in that place in you, and I am in that place in me, then we are One"

Thanks in anticipation.
