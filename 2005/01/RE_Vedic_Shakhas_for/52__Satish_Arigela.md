While I meant no insult to him, supporting arguments
can be found in the list archives and elsewhere. It is
too easy and the issue only too clear that I did not
bother to provide quotes etc.

By the way what do you think he meant when he said
"they did not read samhitas"? Who did not read?
Shankaracharya?

 That is *not* my opinion. That is the traditional
one. That of Shankaracharya's and others.
I am not saying something new to support with research
or an extensive study.

Even if a Brahmana does not follow what he is supposed
to do delusion or negligence, he can be brought back
to the fold using appropriate prayaschittas etc.

 A Brahmana is one born to Brahmin parents and who has
gone through the upanayana ceremony and does whatever
is expected of his ashrama.
Not others. You may refer to Smritis and other
literature.

 Not my opinion as I said before. There is no
injunction saying a Brahmana should should sit idly
after finishing what is to be done for the day.
