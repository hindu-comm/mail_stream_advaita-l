>Are there veda pathasalas who admit vaisyas and kshatriyas
>without discriminating against Brahmanas ?

I am not sure about veda pathasalas, but definitely there are vidvAns who do 
not discriminate on this basis. One of my vaisya friend (and she is a woman) 
is learning vedas from a very learned pundit in B'lore. North India is still 
more liberal. I am a kAyastha from Lucknow. There is no consensus regarding 
kAyastha's place in CAturvarnya system. Some have placed them in kshatriya, 
some in vaiSya and still others in Sudra category. However I did not find 
any difficulty in finding a proper teacher because of not being a brAhmaNa, 
though i myself could never devote enough time to this pursuit.

In fact, majority of vedic vidvAns are not in a position where they can 
afford the luxury of chosing a student. By the time they master vedas and 
sAyaN bhashya, they are already overage for entry level emplyment 
opportunities. And very few of them are able to simultaneously cope with the 
rigors of secular education. Practically, after mastering vedas they do not 
have any gainful employment opportunities. If they are lucky, they get 
priesthood in some local temple or become purohit. A lot many end up being a 
yoga teacher. Some turn to begging---plain and simple. Those who entirely 
depend upon teaching vedas do not have many livelihood options. If you can 
pay, you are welcome. If you do not have time to go to them, they will be 
more than willing to come to your place for an additional paltry sum. I 
would say that anyone who is even a bit interested should start learning 
irrespective of the caste. If nothing else at least he will earn the puNya 
of supporting a vedic vidvAn.
