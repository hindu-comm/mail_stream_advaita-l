even in modern times there have been some kings who did Veda patha but it
is not the norm.  In Gandhijis autobiography, he (a Gujarati Modh
vaishya) describes undergoing yajnopavita, but it doesn't seem to have
made much impression on him.  Effectively, Vedic study amongst Kshatriyas,
and Vaishyas is dead and has been that way for centuries.
