True that it is for all. The only difference is that
women and the fourth caste do svadhyaya by using the
puranas and agamas not by reciting veda-s.

Following such deluded ones like her will certainly
lead to disaster.

I fail to see why or how any of the above means that
women and non-dvija-s should recite vedas.

The same Manu says that women and shudras are not
supposed to recite vedas etc.
Women had adhikara in the past but it they are barred
from doing so for this yuga just like niyoga and other
things are to be avoided in Kali Yuga.
Shudras never had adhikara to learn vedas before.

  What it means is that teach the essence of supreme
to everyone. Since women and shudras cant learn veda
that "auspicious voice" should be taught to them using
puranas and agamas.

Vedas are the exclusive property of Brahmanas.
Kshatriyas and Vaishyas can learn them if a Brahmana
is willing to teach. That they are not for everyone is
mentioned not only in the puranas but also in the
Agamas.
This is also said in various agamas/tantras.

 No body is claiming. The devatas themselves said that
vedas are the property of Brahmanas.

The same books presribe the usage of animals. Devi
Bhagavatha for one says that killing for a sacrifice
is not killing and hence nothing is being killed when
an animal is cut during a yaga.

  Great!

 Obviously a wrong conclusion.

 Most of these might have been discussed earlier were
adddressed before. You can search the archives for
discussions here.

I think you need to do more research and spare us of
these long lectures.
