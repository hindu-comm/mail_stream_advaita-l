Read "My Experiments With Truth"  It made zero impression on him and he
probably never bothered replacing it after the first year.

A Rajput friend of our family once told me a similiar thing.  In his
community, a groom is given yagnopavita the day before the wedding and
takes it off immediately after the festivities conclude.

This is only amongst Advaitins.  Swaminarayan sampradaya follows Ramanuja
and vishistadvaita believes in jnanakarmasamucchaya.  So their sannyasis
keep yajnopavita, shikha etc. or even acquire them as in the above case.

1.  I think you mean Kunbis not Kurmis and they are from Maharashtra not Punjab.

2. The claim is based on the fanciful derivation of their two main castes,
Leva and Kadwa from Lava and Kush, the sons of Shri Rama.

3. Patels are not dvijas.  However what this shows is that while the caste
system discouraged individual social mobility, entire groups did move up
and down in status.  Sometimes they rewrote history to bolster their
claims.

But this all beside the point as far as dharma is concerned.  One of the
people I admire the most, a Patel woman who babysat my daughter, wouldn't
know what a janoi was, doesn't know any sanskrit and is still one of my role
models of how a dharmic person should be.
