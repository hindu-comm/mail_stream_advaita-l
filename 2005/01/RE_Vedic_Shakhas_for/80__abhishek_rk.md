I hereby make the announcement, "I declare life-time
financial support
(covering all basic needs of a BrAhmaNa) to at least
two BrAhmaNas on
this mailing list who will abandon their professions
based upon western
education, and take up Vedic studies and practise
vaidIka dharma
full-time."
----------------------------------------------------
I am sure that no brAhmaNa would take up such an offer
because to live in servility to a master is explicitly
forbidden in the Manu Smriti. But this would anyhow be
turning from one dAsyatva (job) to another (support by
someone else).

When looked at from the proper angle, the Manu smriti
is actually  quite a liberal text. Its author takes
into account all possible situations and gives the
solution to most dharmic problems.

regards,
Abhishek
