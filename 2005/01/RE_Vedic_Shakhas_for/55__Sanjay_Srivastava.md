Is this the case here, sir? Did the original poster discuss the case of 
a_particular_Brahmin who found_it_IMPOSSIBLE_to_maintain by being an Acharya 
or a Purohita? I have not studied Baudhayana but I can always sympathize 
with apad-dharma. What about the case raised by the original poster where 
subject did not even try to be an Acharya or a Purohita simply because this 
was not as rewarding as other professions? I am curious to know if 
Baudhayana sanctions that too.
