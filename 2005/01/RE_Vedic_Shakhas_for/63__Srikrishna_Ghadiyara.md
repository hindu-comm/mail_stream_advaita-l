If brAhmaNa-s should change as per the changing times,
why not others as well ? 

Do we have to stick to a tradition which is gone, as
you admit that kings and patronage has gone now. 

I am generally inclined to think that many people do
not have the 'commitment' to pursue the vedic
education excepting an insignificant percentage of the
people of the brAhmaNa caste fold itself. As such, low
number of experiments in structure by sustaining
deviations do not produce any greater good to society.
Also, if the results of the  vedic education have to
give true results to the individual and to the society
in general, we need to identify right combination of
mind, temperament, ability to derive support from
family and society and LIVE through entire life. It is
possible that these are nurtured in certain families.
Though we can not scientifically prove, it is possible
that the three gunas theory seems to suit more for the
people of the present brAhmaNa community in larger
numbers and probably, in smaller numbers for other
communities. For me this is the only generic reason
which seems to appeal. Comments from all of you are
welcome.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
