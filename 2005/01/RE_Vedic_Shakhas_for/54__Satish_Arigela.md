Baudhayana says that, if a Brahmin finds it impossible
to maintain by being an Acharya or a Purohita, he may
take to the livelihood of a Kshatriya or of that of a
Vaishya.
Hence, no harm I guess. I see no violation about a
Brahmin being a lawyer.

Baudhayana is definitely considered authoritative.

  He is a Sanyasin and ofcourse his Dharma differs.
