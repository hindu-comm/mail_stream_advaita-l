Very true, however these were thoughts of mortals based on their 
experience of the consciousness which have been passed on over the ages 
and deluding oneself to think they magically appeared out of nowhere is 
a little out of the way in my opinion.

Confusing to say the least. Why is the right to learn Vedic education 
elitist and specifically gender specific? The explanation in terms of 
that time and age comes from the society structure that enjoined women 
to engage in household activities and fully complement the male's bread 
winning role. Add to this the patriarchal family system and you will 
realize that these rules were for men,by men.  Would the same hold in 
today's society where individuals are seen for what they are and not for 
what their genders are? Would a honest seeker - male or female - be 
denied the right to seek consciousness?

It's quite convenient to say Gargi and Maitreyi never existed while 
others did.  Classic case of accepting an opinion in a book that matches 
one's own.

Occam's razor - Jaldharji, I'll suggest we do not invoke this argument 
at all. Atheism rests on Occam's razor and the atheist believes in the 
non-existence of God/consciousness simply because that is the simplest 
explanation available. Hence, Occam's razor might just not work to your 
advantage in this case.

The argument so far has been based on what we interpret from our 
readings of the scriptures.   My ignorance far outweighs my knowledge 
but there are numerous cases where the Srutis and Smrutis do not 
correlate. Again, this is not a matter of interpretation. Many 
advaitins, most recently Swami Vivekananda and Sri Ramakrishna believed 
in accepting the Srutis ahead of the Smrutis - but Vedic knowledge as 
applied to this time and age is to be imparted by a qualified teacher to 
a qualified,devoted disciple.
I fail to see how this is gender specific.

Maybe the words "Sanatana Dharma" are inappropriate in the event of your 
interpretations.


Hari Om,
Navin
