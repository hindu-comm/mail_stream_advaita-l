Is there a permission that such brahmana can get into
trade, law, medicine for earning living and compete
with other communities ? As per some reference in
Hindu Dharma of paramacharya, he said that a brahmana
should learn all the arts (don't remember specifics)
but not use them for earning living, but teach and
guide the society. So, paramacharya learnt dance (?)
music and other subjects. But, we know he did not earn
money based on that.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
