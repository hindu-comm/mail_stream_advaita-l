As per the Mimamsa shastra (and Advaitins concur) the Vedas are not the
words of the creator.  They are apaurusheya and preceded the creator.

The figure I have heard is 20 out of 407 -- a trifling 4%.  If we accept
"nearly 11" that makes 2.5%. Subtracting a few other Rshis who were not
human at all, it is clear that from the very beginning the Vedic culture
was overwhelmingly male.  Now if you were to go into any mandir on any
given day, chances are more than half the worshippers there will be women.
So if we take your advice and go back to the Vedas, it will be a
tremendous step backwards for women.  Right?

What about them?  We have no way of knowing even that they existed or not.
This is not a radical skeptics view, it is what the Mimamsaka Kumarila
Bhatta says in shlokavarttika.  A rshi is not the author of mantras but a
mantradrashta -- a "see-er" of mantras.  By what process they did this is
unknown but they did.  So the names of the discoverers are attached to the
mantras.  It like when we talk of "Newtons laws of gravity."  If one is
not a Christian fundamentalist like Isaac Newton does the value of the
gravitational constant change?  If one doesn't live in the 16th century
like Isaac Newton, does one accelerate slower or faster or something?

The nature or personality of the Rshis has no bearing on what they taught.

Then let us ask why this is so?  Do you mean to tell me these rather
simple arguments we both are making didn't occur to a single one of the
greatest minds of India in the entire several-millenia history of our
civilization?  That just strains credulity.  And Occams razors suggests a
simpler explanation.

> I'm very sorry if I'm harsh, I don't intend to hurt,

No offense is taken at all.  But I'll tell you one thing that annoys me.
We say that Hinduism is the "most scientific" religion typically based on
some purported similarity to quantum physics or something.  But here I am
making my arguments on the basis of history, sociology, anthropology,
logic, sciences which are actually relevant to the topic at hand and in
return I get speeches and slogans.  If we are to continue this discussion,
let us atleast base it on facts.
