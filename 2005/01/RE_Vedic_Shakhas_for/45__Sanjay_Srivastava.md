I agree this approach is fraught with danger. However when even the people 
well versed in dharmashastras have differing opinions, it only shows that 
this not a black-and-white case. I will therefore refrain from passing any 
judgement.

Excellent point.

I am glad if you did. Everytime I go back to India, my parents insist on 
organizing a brahmabhoj as part of shuddhi/prayaSchita to mitigate the sins 
of crossing the sea. I'll save lot of money.

I am not sure here who is the parking rules violator and who is the robber. 
I think someone who violates a rule as apad-dharma would be a minor violator 
than one who commits it as a meditated act out of greed.
