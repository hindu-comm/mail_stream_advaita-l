Hi Kartik:

Yes, some  do not adhere to that.  I think it is better to adhere to
that on a voluntary basis. Or at least restrict oneself to 1 post per
thread. We introduced this measure when we had that Advaita vs dvaita
debate.  It gives more time to think and respond, rather replying on
the fly like a chat board, and it becomes worse when the replies start
getting nasty.

As one of the moderators, I am not going to enforce this strictly*. 
But I am strongly in favor of it though, it was a brilliant idea
proposed by Vidyasankar during the time of the Advaita/dvaita debate
to bring some sense of sanity to the list. I think advaita-L needs
this measure. We wrote a FAQ on this, if I find that file, I will post
it once in a while.


With best regards,

Ravi
