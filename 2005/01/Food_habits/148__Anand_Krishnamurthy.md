What do our shastras say about vegetarianism? I have a
very close Bengali Brahmin friend, whose family
associates itself with the Puri Math. He tells me that
his family has always been consuming meat with taboo
on beef consumption. I think most other communities
also consume meat. Is the origin vedic or jaina?
Thanks 
Anand
