The commentary of MedhAtithi on the MS can be found online at
http://www.payer.de/dharmashastra/dharmash00.htm . The webpage is
mostly in German, but contains Ganganath Jha's translation in English
too. Here's what it says regarding 5.56:

Medhâtithi:

'There is no sin in the eating of meat.' This assertion stands on the
same footing as verse.32 above. What we learn from the present verse
(in addition to what we know already) is that 'abstention is conductive
to great rewards. ' By various deprecatory texts the impression has
been produced that 'no meat should be eaten.' But by way of providing a
means of living for living beings it has been asserted that 'there is
no sin in the eating of meat' ; which means that there is no sin if one
eats such meat as is the remnant of the worship of Gods, etc., or what
is eaten at the wish of Brahmanas, and under such similar circumstances
specified above ; but this only if he wish to eat it.

'Abstention'taking the resolve not to eat meat and then to abstain
from itthis is 'conducive, to great reward.' In the absence of the
mention of any particular reward, Heaven is to be regarded as the
reward. So say the Mîmâmsakas...

But there are nitya karmas that require animal sacrifice and therefore
meat-eating. How can one take the vow of abstention from meat-eating
and fail to perform the nitya karmas?

MedhAtithi doesn't really answer the above question in his commentary
on verse MS 5.18:

---
Medhâtithi:

Among five-nailed animals, the Porcupine and the rest are fit to be
eaten.

In another Smrti, there is option regarding the Rhinoceros. Says
Vasishtha (14-47)'They dispute about the rhinoceros.'

With the exception of the camel, all those animals are fit to be eaten
which have only one line of teeth ; for instance, the cow, the goat and
the deer.

"In as much as the present verse specifies the porcupine &c. as alone
fit to be eaten, among five-nailed animals,it follows that all the
other five-nailed animals are unfit to be eaten ; so that the
prohibition of 'all five-nailed animals' becomes entirely superfluous."

There is nothing wrong in this. When the prohibition is stated in so
many words, our comprehension of it is direct; if on the other hand, we
were to derive our knowledge of what should not be eaten from the
specification of what should be eaten, our comprehension of the
prohibition would be only inferential, indirect ; and this would be a
complicated process.
