Kartik, can MS 5.56 be interpreted in the following way (I have added
modifiers in "()" braces):

"There is no fault in eating (consecrated) meat (this is mentioned
explicitly so that people don't get misled by MS 5.52). However,
abstinence (in performing a kAmya yajna that involves animal sacrifice)
bears great fruit..."
