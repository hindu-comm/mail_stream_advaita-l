Q-16. Are Adi Sankaran's Vedam and Gothram known? You trace the mother
to Melpuzha Mana. You merely name the father as Kaipilli Sivaguru.
(Prof. Mahadevan, Howard University, USA)

Ans: Sri Sankarachaaryar was a Rigvedi - Aswalaayanan. He belonged to
Kaippilly Mana near Kaladi. His Gothram is not known but can be found
out. His Ammaath (mother's house) was Melpazhur Mana, also a Rigvedi -
Aswalaayanan. Melpazhur Mana's Gothram is Angirass, and Pravaram,
Bharadwajam. Owing to his father's death, his mother's brother
conducted his Upanayanam.
