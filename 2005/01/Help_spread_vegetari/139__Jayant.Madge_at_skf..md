Dear Mohanram,


Here in India, Maharashtra, Jalgaon we have Goshala which takes care of 
1532 (bulls, cows and their calfs).     In thier musium also we can not 
even see the pictures similar to screened on the video at 
www.meetyourmeat.com site.


There might be more Goshalas both in India and around the world taking 
care of not only cows but other animals.


Now I cannot express any more words.


Thanks and best regards,

Jayant.
