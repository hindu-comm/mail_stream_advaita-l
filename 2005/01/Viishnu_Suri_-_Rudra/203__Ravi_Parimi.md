I myself have read this book by Swamiji (although not in such great
detail) and have experienced the same. I think RK Math is truly
committed to spreading knowledge and the ideas of vedanta to the
world. When you compare RK Math to Chinmaya mission, there is a stark
difference in the prices of books/material each sells. I have
purchased books online from RK Math and am very satisfied with their
prompt service. Their "Mantrapushpam" is probably one of the best
books they have to offer. Its hard to find such a beautiful compendium
of important parts of the veda in one book. I wish they also had an
accompanying CD or set of tapes with that book..Did anyone come across
such tapes?
