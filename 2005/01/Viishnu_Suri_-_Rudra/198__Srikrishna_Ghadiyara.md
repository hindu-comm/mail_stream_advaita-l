Just to  comment on online purchase from RM Math
Chennai. I purshased online and the books got shipped
by the next day or so. I am very pleased with their
service. When I noticed that one of the books missed
10 pages, they immediately sent me photocopies of
those pages by air-mail. I found the Svami who
interacted with me in the process, through e-mail, to
be very helpful.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
