Not to mention the fact that Al Beruni visited India around 900AD and
records 18 mahA and upapurANas.

In any case, sha.nkara quotes the mahAbhArata and the gItA repeatedly,
which are accessible to everyone. Everyone seems to have forgotten
that. Sha.nkara is quite emphatic that it's not the vedas alone, but
also smR^iti which can lead to enlightenment. smR^iti is after all an
authoritative means of knowledge, providing information beyond what
pratyakshha, etc., can offer. Since smR^iti is derived from shruti,
sha.nkara does not explicitly mention it in many places. But in the
sUtra bhAshhya, he is fairly explicit.
