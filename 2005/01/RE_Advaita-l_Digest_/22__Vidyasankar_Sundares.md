Yes, to most of the above. The pUrva mImAMsA attributes agency to the self, 
without going into what the nature of the self is. vedAnta goes into the 
latter question and at least in the advaita school, holds that the self is 
ultimately not an agent at all. However, advaita vedAnta accepts that since 
men usually consider themselves to be agents, Sruti prescribes both the 
course of correct karma and the course of withdrawal from karma.

What I meant by saying that when it comes to performing, we turn back to the 
pUrva mImAMsA, is that for the karma kANDa, we accept the mImAMsA decisions 
on such questions as which statement is a vidhi, what is the nature of the 
vidhi (apUrva, niyama etc), when the said karma is to be performed etc. 
However, precisely because the nature of karma and the self are seen so 
differently in the two darSana-s, it is not possible to consider one as a 
modified form of the other.

Vidyasankar
