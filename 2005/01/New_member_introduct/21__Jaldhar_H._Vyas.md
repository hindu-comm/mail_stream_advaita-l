Namastey,

I am a ardent follower of Shankaracharya and his works , I have
read most of the upanishads and needless to say my favourite is 'Katho
Upanishad'. I am from India, recently moved to UK...I am terribly missing
my satsangs at R.K.Math and the wonderful lectures on advaita,,,while
browsing I found this site and thought perhaps I could get regular updates
on books and lectures by known scholars and monks.

thanks geeta
