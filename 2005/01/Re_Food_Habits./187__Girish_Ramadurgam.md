I happen to read a book on Hinduism by Anbil Ramaswamy which has this to 
say

QUOTE
A further question can be asked whether vegetarianism is not also 
'himsa' in the sense that it has been proved that plans have life? It 
has further been proved that in the case of plants, lifeline runs in the 
trunks in some cases, root in others and seeds in others and that is why 
sastras have prohibited cutting the plants at their respective lifelines 
- and this has been confirmed by modern science. Modern science concurs 
with sastras in the view that those parts where the lifelines do not 
run, no harm is caused when those parts are cut. These parts correspond 
to say hair on our head or the nails on our fingers or toes which when 
cut or clipped do not entail any pain.
UNQUOTE


No sure where exactly the information was collected from, but I am not 
sure of any  thing regarding what is mentioned about mordern science or 
the Sastras.

Can anyone throw light on this and if the above is really 
acceptable/cogent argument.

As for Meat -
I was under the notion that Non Vegetarian food was associated with 
Tamas Guna. Am I wrong?

- Girish
