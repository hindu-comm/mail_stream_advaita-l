Namaste Praveenji,

Here Existence would mean Absolute Existence. That which exists in all three
periods of time (past, present & future). We can also call it Eternal.
Therefore, it is called Real also.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Upadesha sahasri (translated by Swami Jagadananda)


praNAm,

In Chapter 1 of Upadesha sahasri (translated by Swami Jagadananda), under
7-8, satyam(-jnAnam-anantham) 
has been translated as Existence(-Knowledge-Infinite). I have a very limited
understanding of sanskrit, but is there 
a specific *advaitic* reason why satyam is translated as existence against
commonly used truth? Is it used so to 
assert that brahmaN *exists*, as in it is *real* (from the advaita-parlance
of real-unreal-not real) the effect which 
perhaps *true* wouldn't have given?

Pls. guide.

Thanks much,

jai bajranga bali,
