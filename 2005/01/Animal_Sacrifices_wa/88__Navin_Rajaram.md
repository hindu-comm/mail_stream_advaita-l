Kartik,thank you for the kamakoti link. Some of my readings and 
discussions on this topic of vegetarianism tell me that since Brahmanas 
were entrusted with imparting and seeking spiritual knowledge, their 
food intake needed to desist from consuming foods of the 
Tamasik/Rajasvik nature. Not just meat, but vegetarian items of this 
nature were avoided in an effort to maintain balance.

On the other hand, kshatriyas who needed to fight were not prohibited 
from consuming meat - simply because Raja-guna was a positive for a 
warrior . I am not sure as to whether these foods actually helped a 
warrior but from the perspective of developing Sattva-guna being a 
prerequisite for a spiritual seeker, meat and other such foods are to be 
avoided.

Hari Om,
Navin
