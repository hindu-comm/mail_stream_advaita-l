That comes as quite a surprise to me because the animal nature is linked 
with Tama-guna and Raja-guna -identification per se with the body and 
the senses.  My understanding was that in an effort to transcend these 
gross levels of identification, meat eating and/or killing of animals is 
to be avoided.  I guess the same might not apply to a spiritual seeker, 
say in the Sahara or the North pole where vegetation is at a minimum and 
meat is the main source of food.

I agree..there are conflicting views on this topic. Inspite of 
personally choosing to be a vegetarian, I do not know how these choices 
are themselves responsible for higher moral ground. Maybe these are just 
circumstantial choices of food habits.
