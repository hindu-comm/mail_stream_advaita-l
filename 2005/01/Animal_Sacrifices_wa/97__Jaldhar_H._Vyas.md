In Halal slaughter the animals are dedicated to Allah so the inescapable
conclusion is...  Of course those bullies wouldn't dare pick on someone
their own size.

But lets trace this malady to its source.  The reason people can get away
such things is because the so-called defenders of Hinduism are only
interested in combatting such fantasies because they want to install their
own fantasies.  Thus they have no moral authority.  The only way they ever
will is when they start concentrating on what Hinduism is, not what is
might be or could be or ought to be.
