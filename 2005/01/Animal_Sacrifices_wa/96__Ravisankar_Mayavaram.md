If I am not mistaken Anand Hudli discussed this in some context a
while ago. Even if you use a vegetarian substitute, you are indeed
killing it as you have to do prANa pratishhTa.  Unlike other
religions, in vaidika traditions sin committed in mind is also a sin.
That is why we pray for  manasa, vaacha etc.  If someone objects to
killing, in principle, one is  indeed in killing just by the virtue of
prANa pratishhTa.

I think substitutions may not be wrong as such, but shows the aversion
of brahmaNa-s to kill physically. Hence, doing something like that
becomes equivalent to homa dravya substitution.

Animal right activists can do that because, there are laws which back
them. Those who wrote the Indian constitution and who continue to have
modify it have a little or no regard for vedic religion. There are
laws in different states which prohibit sacrificing animal for
religious reasons. For instance

quoted from a website:
-------------------------------------
Laws that prohibit animal sacrifice

Though Article 51 of the Directive Principles of the Constitution of
India states that individuals should show kindness and compassion
towards all living beings, animals continue to be slaughtered in a
cruel and illegal manner for the purpose of sacrifice.

Specific laws prohibiting animal sacrifice have been passed only in a
few states of India. These states are, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
Gujarat, Kerala, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu  and Pondicherry. The rule
regarding animal sacrifices in all these states roughly contain the
same facts. Section 2(b) of the Andhra Pradesh Animals and Birds
Sacrifices (Prohibition) Act, 1950, defines "sacrifice" as the killing
or maiming of any animal or bird for the purpose of any animal or bird
for the purpose of any religious worship or adoration.

These Acts specially prohibit any person from officiating, performing,
assisting or participating in any sacrifice. It also maintains that no
one can knowingly allow such a sacrifice to be performed at any place
of religious worship or place under his control.

The penalty for contravention extends to a fine and/or imprisonment.

In so far as the other states which lack such specific Acts, the
following legal provisions can be used: ...<clip>
