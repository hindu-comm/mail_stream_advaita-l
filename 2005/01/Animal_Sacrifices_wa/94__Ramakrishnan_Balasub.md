I have no idea about the article. But I have been told there are
various smR^iti texts contradicting each other regarding meat eating
during shraaddham. Sorry I can't produce quotes off-hand. Then the
question of sadaacharam/aitihyam also comes into play (another valid
source of knowledge). Usually, it has less force than smR^iti, but
when texts contradict each other, it may come into play. Whether there
is an injuction in shruti about eating meat in a shraaddha, I do not
know. One has to examine the original sources from these texts and see
as per miimaa.nsaa rules how forceful the statements are with respect
to meat in shraaddha. It's best to contact someone in the know. Try
Sri Ganesh Prasad on the shrouta list.

I have no idea why they did anything like that. You'll have to ask
them. Perhaps, they did not want any controversy. Of course,
nambuudiris are also technically not smaarthas. There have been/still
are yaagams with animal sacrifices in TN, Andhra, etc. Except they are
usually low-key to avoid unncessary attention.
