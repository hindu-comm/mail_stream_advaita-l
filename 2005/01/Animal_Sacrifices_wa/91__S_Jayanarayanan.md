What you say holds in general -- that killing animals or eating their
meat is to be avoided.

However, killing of animals in the context of the Vedic sacrifice is
commanded by the shruti, and the partaking of their meat is enjoined by
the smR^iti, so it cannot be rAjasic or tAmasic. This is therefore an
exception to above general rule.

They aren't so conflicting as there is a general rule, and exceptions
to the general rule in specific cases. 

In the case of animal sacrifices, I'm certain that there were always
BrAhmaNas who were unhappy with performing them, and it is for them
that an alternate way of vegetarian substitutes is recommended.
