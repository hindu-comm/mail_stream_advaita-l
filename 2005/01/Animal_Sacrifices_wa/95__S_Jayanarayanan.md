AFAIK, "smArta" only refers to a follower of smR^iti. Is there some
specific reason why the Namboothiris are not followers of the smR^itis?

And according to the namboothiri.com website:
http://www.namboothiri.com/articles/bhattathiris.htm
"Smaartha Bhattathiris: In olden days, certain families specialised in
conducting trials and bringing out the evidences from the mouth of the
culprit, if a Namboothiri (man or woman) committed sins in social life.
They conducted trials only on Namboothiris...The process of trial was
called "Jaathi Saasyam" or "Smaartha Vichaaram", and the expert
conducting it was called Smaarthan or Smaartha Bhattathiri. Here, the
term Bhattathiri is synonymous to "expert Namboothiri"."
