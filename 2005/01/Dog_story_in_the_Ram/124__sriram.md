Dear Member
Namaskarams.To my best of knowledge and having attended pravachanams by
eminent scholars like Sengalipuram Anantharama Dikshithar there is no story
of a dog in the Ramayana.It is said that a referance is found in the Uttra
Kanda.When one goes through the account given one can easily cast it out.The
reason is in Rama rajya there was subiksham every where and nobody need go
in search of food to satisfy one`s hunger.So a dog coming in the way of a
brahmana in search of food does not appear to be befitting the narration.
Some time -fairly long-some one weanted to know what is the meaning of
*Vairochanim*occuring in the Durga suktham.While reciting Sri Vishnu
Sahasranamam I tarried at the name Virochana:.The meaning given is-this is
the 882 name-the One who shines in many ways.Sri Durga is praised as *Agni
varnam* so *Vairochanim* can be taken to mean shining in many ways.Pranams.
