Namaste,
In the Bhagvad Gita translation of Sw. Gambhirananda,
Vacaspati Mishra and the Author of khanDa are
mentioned as "recent" examples of persons who attained
mukti though engaged in karma yoga like King Janaka of
old. Now do we have any info about the lives of
Vacaspati Mishra and the "author of khanDa" (who is he
and what is khanDa all about)?... in the traditional
works or other sources?

Dhanyavadah,
Abhishek
