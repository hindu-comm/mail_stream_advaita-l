Namaste ShrI Karthik,
Would this be correct: Brahman revealed the Vedas to
the Rshis acting as their (immanent) Guru?

Dhanyavadah
Abhishek

------------------------------------------------------
It should be taken to mean that the Vedas came from
the supreme
Brahman, not that it was created by That. Just as
these words that I'm
typing have come from me, and not that they were
created by me.

Vide Shankara's commentary on GItA verse 15.15: "I am
also the
vedanta-krt, the originator of the Vedanta, i.e., the
source of the
traditional school of the teachings of Vedanta"

-Kartik
