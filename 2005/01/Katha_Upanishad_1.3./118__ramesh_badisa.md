Pranam,

Can anyone give their views on the following mantra from Katha Upanishad as per advaita philosophy: 

1.3.1 (rtam pibantau ....)

Who these two persons are, implied as light and shadow, in this mantra? Since both are present in the cavity of heart, is one them divine and other is soul? 

Pranam

Badisa
