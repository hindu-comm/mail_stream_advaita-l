"Shankara in the prasthana traya bhashyas is establishing the tradition of
teaching Moksha. And to this tradition we give a name Advaita Vedanta. The
goal is Moksha and not Advaita Vedanta."

Very true. However if someone is teaching his own philosophy, why to name it 
"Advaita Vedanta" to to add more confusion to already existing one? I have 
attended Ramesh' lectures in Mumbai for over three years. I will not argue 
about the merits or otherwise of his teachings, but certainly there is 
nothing Advaita in his philosophy in the usual sense of Advaita. Use of term 
"advaita" only serves to confuse spiritual novices like me.
