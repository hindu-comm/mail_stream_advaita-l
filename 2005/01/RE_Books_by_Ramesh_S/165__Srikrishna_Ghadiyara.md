hariH Om !!

Sri Girish:

You will be doing yourself a great favor by reading
Ramesh Balsekar. Yes, Ramesh does not teach Upanishads
and BrahmaSutra. But, he teaches the same essence. In
fact only after I had the fortune of meeting him, do I
understand Advaita Vedanta.

The only difference in his teaching is that he does
not care to answer what transmigrates. He does not
care to bring up a theory of how this world came
about? No panchikarana sorts. He forces you to think
and be clear about what you are seeking and shatters
all the confusion in very simple terms. I am yet to
meet a teacher as profound and compassionate as Ramesh
is. My understanding of Bhagavad Gita is much better
after listening to Ramesh and reading his books. But,
it is true that he is not accessible to every beginner
who is not willing to give up logic built on set
notions. He is like Gaudapada. He is like Ramana
Maharshi with some modification in the sense Ramesh
does not even ask you to find out who you are, instead
he wants you to enquire if you are the doer.

If you are to start reading Ramesh, I would suggest
you not to start with 'Ultimate Understanding'. I
would suggest you to start with 'Confusion No More',
(just to save money), as this book has almost complete
extracts from three of Ramesh's previous books... Who
Cares?, The Infamous Ego and Sin and Guilt along with
an Introduction and Conclusion newly written by
Ramesh. I have personally liked all the three books
and benefited.

Hope this helps you.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
