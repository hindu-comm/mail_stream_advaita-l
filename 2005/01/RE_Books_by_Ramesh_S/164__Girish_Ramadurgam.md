Thanks Mr Vyas for correcting me. I do swallow words when I type, which I
shall try to avoid.

I should say I am surprised by what you said. You say Ramesh S Balsekar does
not follow Advaita Vedanta. The website http://www.rameshbalsekar.com/ does
convey a different message.

I think I shall go ahead order a book and get to know what I am looking for.

Thank you all.
