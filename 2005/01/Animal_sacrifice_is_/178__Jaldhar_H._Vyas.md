On the other hand, the vivarana was not included in the Vani Vilasa
edition of the complete works of Shankaracharya.  Indeed I believe the
first editions of this work only came out relatively recently.  It seems
strange that such a major work of Shankaracharya would have been totally
forgotten.  It is also strange that none of his disciples have quoted from
it even though there are many instances where yoga is discussed.

On the third hand Shankaracharya does I believe quote from the Yogasutras
in the Gita and Brahmasutra bhashyas so I suppose it is not out of the
question he could have composed a yogasutra bhashya.

This is indeed the classic Samkhya/Yoga position but see Brahmasutra
3.1.25, ashuddhimiti chenna shabdAt.  (If it is argued "impure" no,
because of shruti.)

The opponent says that because the Vedas teach ahimsa, killing of animals
for sacrifice is a sin.  Shankaracharya says you cannot rely on the Vedas
as your authority and then use them to contradict themselves.  The correct
interpretation is that ahimsa is a general rule, but killing in sacrifices
is an exception to that general rule.

I want to clarify one thing:

Actually the animal sacrifices are all kamya and hence optional.  So even
the karmayogi can abstain from rhinoceros with a clean conscience :-)
