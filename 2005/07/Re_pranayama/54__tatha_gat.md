I would just like to point out that for Ramana
Maharshi, pranayama was not "control of breath" but
rather the "control of the pause between the breath".
He sometimes said that when you focus on increasing
the pause between the breath, then the one overriding
thought of desperately wanting to breathe will drive
all other thoughts away. He also used to say that true
pranayama is done not with the breath or prana but
with concepts - rechaka is when you "exhale out the I
thought", puraka is when you "inhale in the knowledge
of reality" and kumbhaka is when you "stay steadfast
in the true knowledge"

Regards,
Mayuresh.
