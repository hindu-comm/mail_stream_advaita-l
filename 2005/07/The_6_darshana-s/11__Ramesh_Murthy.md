Namaste,

Had some questions on the 6 darshana-s.

1. What is the historical basis for the classification of the 6
darshana-s? Is there any traditional  source that brings out this
classification?

2. Are there any sanyaasi-s/pandit-s who still adhere to any of the
darshana-s apart from Vedanta?

3. Specific to Yoga, what is the place of Raja Yoga in the Sankara
mutts? And what is the traditional view on the compatibility of Raja
Yoga with Jnana, Bhakti and Karma Yoga-s?

Swami Satyananda Saraswati, who is a dashanaamii sanyaasi as the name
indicates, refers to himself as a follower of Advaita Vedanta. He also
established the Bihar School of Yoga, one of the leading Yoga-ashrams
in India today. The ashram itself claims to follow Advaita Vedanta.
>From this it does appear that the concept of Ashtanga Yoga as laid out
by Maharshi Patanjali has been fully absorbed in Advaita Vedanta.

 But I would like to know the stand of the Sankara mutts on this. Do
the Shankaracharyas practice asana-s, pranayama, etc? They would
certainly be practising dhyaana (meditation), but is there a
difference between Patanjali's concept of Dhyaana and Adi Sankara's?
