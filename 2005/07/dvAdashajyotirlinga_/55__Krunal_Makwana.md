Dear all,

i am looking for a clear translation of the dvAdashajyotirlinga:

saurAShTre somanAtha.n cha shrIshaile mallikArjunam |
ujjayinyAM mahAkAlamo~NkAramamaleshwaram ||

paralyAM vaidyanAtha.n cha DAkinyAM bhImasha~Nkaram |
setubandhe tu rAmeshaM nAgeshaM dArukAvane ||

vArANasyA.n tu vishvesha.n tryambakaM gautamItaTe |
himAlaye tu kedAra.n ghushmesha.n cha shivAlaye ||

etAni jyotirli~NgAni sAyaM prAtaH paThennaraH |
saptajanmakR^itaM pApaM smaraNena vinashyati ||

eteshaaM darshanaadeva paatakaM naiva tiShThati |
karmakShayo bhavettasya yasya tuShTo maheshvaraaH ||

can anyone help me with this?

Also i am looking for a clear english translation of Shiva Mahimna stotram, 
i have found some translations but they are very broad and though they do 
resemble the sanskrit they are not an easy read, so if anyone could find me 
a very clear concise translation that is easy reading please help me, lol!

In Sanatan Dharma's service,

Krunal
