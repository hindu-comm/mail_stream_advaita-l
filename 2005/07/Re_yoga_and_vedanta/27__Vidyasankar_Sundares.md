Well, differing from Sankara and/or sureSvara on certain individual points 
does not mean that an AchArya like madhusUdana sarasvatI is not a proper 
representative of the sampradAya. We must remember that in the 
bR^ihadAraNyaka bhAshya vArttika, even sureSvara differs from Sankara, and 
explicitly so.
