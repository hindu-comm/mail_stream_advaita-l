The key thing to note is Sri sureshvarAchArya and Sri padmapAdA are
direct disciples of Sri Sankara. Hence, their knowledge of what
Sankara thought on a particular point does not rely on  texts alone 
but more on  their direct personal interaction with him. I think any
difference expressed in their work must have had the sanction of
Sankara. And probably with a definite purpose.

Sri Venkatji  wrote: 
"Swami Sachidananendra points out to clashes even between Sri
Shankara's own commentary (on the topic of Prana Vrithi (i.e. whether
Prana is anu or vibhu).  He points out to the scoffing remark of the
Brahma Sutra Bhasyakara on the view point held by the Brihadaranyaka
Bhashyakara."

Did Sankara write BSB after or before  writing bhAShya on
bR^ihadAraNyaka? In either case, does it not indicate a change in his
point of view.
