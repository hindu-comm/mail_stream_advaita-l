When composing Sanskrit works, it is typical to compose ma~Ngala
shlokas. There is even a rule that works should always begin with
ma~Ngala shlokas. Now such shlokas are typically to ones ishhTa
devatta or guru or both. Take Vidyaaranya. Does he begin with a
ma~Ngala shloka to shankara? He merely salutes Vidyatirtha, as far as
I can remember. Or take the works of sarvaj~naatman. He begins the
sa~Nkshhepashaariiraka with shlokas to his guru (deveshvara), vishhNu
and a particularly beautiful shloka on ganesha. Take the works of
citsukha. Does he salute shankara in the beginning, he salutes only
j~naanottama his guru and Narasimha? Or vimuktaatman, who salutes the
pure brahman?

It's more an exception rather than the rule that later advaitic
authors salute sha.nkara in their ma~Ngala shlokas. Comparing it with
the sha~Nkaravijayam is not correct because the latter is a
kaavyam/itihaasam. It is supposed to narrate events.

Sarvaj~naatman mentions sha.nkara and sureshvara by name many times.
Never once does he mention that the latter is a disciple of the
former. It is indeed a Western notion that these things need to be
mentioned explicitly. For the Indians, such things are not of much
importance.

The vivaraNa was written to expound the pa~ncapaadikaa and not to
expound on who was whose disciple. Prakaashaatman may not have
considered it important enough to say such details, because for him it
could have been an obvious fact and not something people were
questioning at that time, i.e., he would have had no idea people 1200
years later would be questioning whether Padmapaada was shankara's
disciple!

Then every advaitic author would be saluting shankara in their works,
which is most definitely not the case!

Try the english biography published by the kaaryaalaya.

In other words you are saying that it is an open issue whether the
advaitic authors other than SS in the last 1200 years were fools ?
:-).

In your reply to Anand you had mentioned that sha.nkara does not
follow "independent" tarka. That is indeed the case and I agree
personally that it is not essential to to have independent tarka. You
and I may be satisfied by that. But someone else may find such
arguments which lead to advaita more appealing. Sureshvara very
clearly expounds  independent tarka in his sambandha vaarttika. The
arguments are about how pratyaksha does not in reality reveal
difference. The arguments are basically derived from Mandana. Even the
wordings and even entire verses are the same! R Balasubramanian in his
superb study of the brahmasiddhi claims that this is an indication
that Mandana Mishra might have become Sureshvara. Swami
Satchidanandendra claims that the arguments were probably from a
common source and so look similar. But these arguments are not found
anywhere in sha.nkara's works! So what is the common source?  Clearly
Sureshvara got the arguments from Mandana (if they were not the same
person) and thought they were good and adopted them. Further more it
is very clearly independent reasoning and somewhat anticipates
sriharsha/citsukhas arguments. So even sureshvara does not follow SS's
claim that only the type of reasoning he brands "shrutyaanuga tarka"
should be followed!

In any case, I think I shall stop with this and concentrate on writing
my article. Best to discuss as a whole than piecemeal.

Rama
