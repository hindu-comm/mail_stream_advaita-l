The key thing to note is Sri sureshvarAchArya and Sri padmapAdA are
direct disciples of Sri Sankara. Hence, their knowledge of what
Sankara thought on a particular point does not rely on  texts alone
but more on  their direct personal interaction with him. I think any
difference expressed in their work must have had the sanction of
Sankara. And probably with a definite purpose.

But it is interesting point to be noted here is SS says in his book
paNchapAdikA that prakAshAtma yati who has written vivaraNa commentary on
paNchapAdika nowhere says that paNchapAdika is the work of direct desciple
of shankara i.e. padmapAda.  He cites more than one reason like this in the
introduction to that book.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
