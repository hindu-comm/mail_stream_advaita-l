> 1. What is the historical basis for the classification of the 6

> classification?

I explored this question in a paper I wrote titled "Doxographies - Why 
six dar≈õanas? Which six?" for the 2004 Graduate Student Colloquium at 
the University of Washington. The paper is available at:

Namaste,


Prem.
