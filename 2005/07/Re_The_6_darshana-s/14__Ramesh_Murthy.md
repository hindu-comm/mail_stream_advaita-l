Namaste Prem mahodaya (and others of course!),

Sorry for the late reply. I went through your paper and found it
extremely interesting.

So it is evident that the classification of the 6 darshana-s does have
a traditional basis. From your paper, the first text to have the
currently accepted system of classification of the Astika darshana-s
appears to be the sarvasiddhAntasangraha. Any idea of the date of this
text? And why is it "falsely attributed to sankara" as your paper
quotes?

The detailed classification on page-6 of your paper is particularly
interesting. Could you explain the usage of the following terms:

tArkika vs srauta - my elementary knowledge of sanskrit suggests this
would be "derived through logic" vs "heard", but am not clear why this
distinction should appear here.

Also,
Karmānapekṣeśvaravādin vs Karmasāpekṣeśvaravādin ?
Vākyārthavedin vs Padarthavedin?
