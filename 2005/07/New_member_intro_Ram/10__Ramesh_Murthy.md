Namaste,

Had joined this list on 20th june, and have since spent a lot of time
going through the archives. Quite a learning experience.

Here's my brief intro:

Name: ramesh kR^iShNa mUrtI
Age: 26
currently in Bhopal, India, but keep moving around

Have had a long-standing interest in various aspects of Hinduism, esp
Advaita Vedanta.  Started with Amar Chitra Katha, like many other kids
in India. Have read BG and some of the Upanishads with Swami
Chinmayananda's translations. Have also had some association with the
Ramakrishna Math and read many of Swami Vivekananda's writings.

Regards
Ramesh
