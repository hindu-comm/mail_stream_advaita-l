I will ask the above question to a Pandit during my India visit
later this year.


praNAms
Hare Krishna

laghunyAsaM we use here in South India as a part of rudrAbhishEkaM...Even
in sankalpa we say anyOnya sahAyEna laghunyAsa pUrvaka rudrAbhishEkaM
kariShyamANaH (if the recitation of maNtra-s  being done by group of
vaidiks)..Moreover, laghunyAsaM after stOtra bhAga *shuddha spatika
saNkAshaM* etc. includes anga nyAsa karanyAsa (maNtra-s start from
agnihOtrAtmane anguShtAbhyAnamaH etc.) also...then only we recite the
dhyAna shlOka * ApAtAla nabhasthalAnta bhuvan bhrhmAndamAvispuratu* etc.  &
finally *shuddhOdaka snAnaM* with *shaNchame* (chamakaM) mantra...In our
tradition it is part & parcel of rudrArchana vidhi & invariably we do it
after malApakarShaNa snAnam.

Just my few thoughts.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
