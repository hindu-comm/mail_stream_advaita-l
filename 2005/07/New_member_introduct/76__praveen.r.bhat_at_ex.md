praNAm all,

Sunil-ji,

Its been really blissful to read about the intensity of your desire towards
liberation. As Shankara says if this mumukshatva is the only desire you have
been led into, you need to approach a Guru whom you'll find without doubt.
Its said that at such stage all responsibilities drop off, clearly since one
just can't associate with worldly things then. (I don't know if anyone is
capable/responsible/rightful of suggesting a Guru per se though). Hope your
inner self leads you unto Him soon.

My two cents. krishNArpaNamastu.

jai bajrangabali,
