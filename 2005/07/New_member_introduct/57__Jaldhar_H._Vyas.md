I am Arun,aged 26 and i am at present in the US. I have a MS in computer 
science. I used to attend veda classes regularly during my undergrad in 
BITS Pilani and regularly chant rudram. I browsed through the archives and 
was very delighted in learning about the explanationa for various advaita 
texts. I would like to be a regular part of that knowledge now :)

Love,
Arun
