Iam k.kalyanaraman, aged 36, from Chennai, Tamilnad, India. Iam interested 
in Advaita Vedanta and studying advaita literature's for the past five 
years. I have great respect and adoration towards Shri Adishankara 
Bagavatpada and I have a good collection of his works, which I study 
repeatedly to cleanse my mind of impurities and to make me fit for 
Sadhana. Advaita Vedanta helped me to change my approach towards my life 
and goal and this is only with the help of my two Manasika Gurus, Acharya 
Shri Shankara and Bhagawan Shri Ramana. This is a short introduction of 
myself and I thank you all for the opportunity given to me. Shivoham.
