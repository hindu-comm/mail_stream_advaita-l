I apologize for jumping in the middle. I spent about two years with
Sri Ramesh Balsekar-ji. And though I do not contest the validity of
his teachings from a paramArthic point of view, I realized he was not
for me with my current level of understanding. That said, you might
find "Enlightenment- Who cares?" by Madhukar Thompson and its epilogue
on why he parted ways with Sri Ramesh, quite useful.
