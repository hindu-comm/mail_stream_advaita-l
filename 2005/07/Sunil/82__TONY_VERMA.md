Dear Sundar Raman ji,
I am very pleased about your recommendations, I have meet Sri Jayaendra 
Saraswati ji many times even before he became the head of kamakoti peetham , 
but I have always felt great affinity with Sri Vijayendra saraswati ji, It 
would be great to associate with an unbroken lineage such as that.I shall be 
writting a seperate email to you soon on this subject...........With Warm 
Wishes..Sunil
