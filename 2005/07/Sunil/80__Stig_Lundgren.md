Does this swamiji follow the Holenarsipur tradition? Who initiated him
into sannyaasa?

Yes, he do. Swami Jnanaprasunendra Saraswati was (while still in his 
purvashrama) adviced by Kanchi Shankaracharya Swami Jayendra Saraswati in 
1995 to go to Mathur and study Vedanta. Swami Jnanaprasunendra is a disciple 
of Sri Ashwattha Narayana Avadhani (a direct disciple of Swami 
Satchidanandendra Saraswati) with whom he has been studying for many years. 
Swami Jnanaprasunendra was initiated into sannyasa in 2001 by no one less 
than Swami Jayendra Saraswati himself! The initiation took place in 
Kalahasthi (Andra Pradesh). Jnana Prasunamba is the goddess of Kalahasthi, 
hence SwamijiÂ´s sannyasa name.
