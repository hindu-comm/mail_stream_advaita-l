Dear Vedantins,
For all the spiritual journey is from dualism to semi dualism then non 
dualism then pure nondualism, and the lessons  of nondual truths learnt 
mostly stay at the conscious level but the roots of dwaita are also imbedded 
in our subconcious in the form of deep sanskaras operating unnoticed , that 
is why the jouneyr from dwaita to pure advaita is not that easy. This also 
explians why we have differing attitudes , experiences and thoughts and 
points of views.
For some it is seeking for some it is a jouney of undoing, although the idel 
is" here and now" it is the level of ignorance which surround "IT" at 
conscious level and more so in the unconscious level in Jiva that 
distinguishes one from the other.I urge all to express openly their views, 
for instead of considering as one view belonging to so and so, it would be 
more approprite to consider this exchange as GURU TATTVA creating senarios 
for indivigual and collective learning, for most have joint for exchage of 
views and learning which follows from it..I urge scholars and beginners to 
respond to the message below and answer the questions asked in it..Seeing 
and Not Seeing:

A simple, direct, but fundamental shift in perception reveals that all there 
is is liberation. But oneness does not become apparent through something 
gained, rather through something lost. Many will come across this rare and 
radical message and quickly shuffle back to that which they think they can 
know and do. But there are those with whom this communication will resonate 
. . . and there will be a sudden seeing and falling away of all seeking, 
even for that which they have called enlightenment.
All there is is this. Oneness is being this . . . whatever is apparently 
happening . . . reading these words, breathing, blood coursing through the 
body, sounds being heard, thoughts coming and going and feelings in the body 
- the sense of sitting on a seat maybe. Here is oneness being aliveness as 
this.
No effort is needed for that aliveness to be. Nobody is doing aliveness. Is 
anybody doing sitting on a chair? Thinking is oneness thinking "I don't get 
where this is going", or "this is too simple". All is simply aliveness, 
oneness, being. It cannot be taught or achieved. Who is apart from being to 
achieve being? Who can lose or gain this when this is all there is? 
Resisting oneness is oneness resisting. Seeking oneness is oneness seeking 
itself.
Aliveness is oneness apparently happening. Aliveness is being alive. There 
is only being and the nature of that being is emptiness and fullness, 
nothing and everything, movement and repose.
In that wholeness arises the idea "I am a separate individual". This seems 
to be the beginning of a dream called "me being someone in a world with 
which I have to negotiate".
Here in this separation is the root of all fear and feeling of disquiet 
coming out of a sense of loss. Again it is the appearance of oneness, and in 
that appearance we embark on a journey in which we meet parents, teachers, 
maybe priests, bosses and lovers, and learn how to get what we think we want 
seemingly through personal choice and effort. The pursuit of pleasure and 
the avoidance of pain generates transient experiences of gratification and 
disappointment. The whole manifestation that we call life is simply the 
drama of oneness looking for itself, for all desire is the longing for 
oneness.
For some the idea of enlightenment seems to offer the promise of fulfilment. 
However, the separate individual can only dream individuality. That is its 
function.
Inevitably in the search for enlightenment, the dream seeker is attracted to 
a dream teaching that promotes and reinforces the idea of individual choice 
and effort, which, through discipline and sacrifice, can lead to the 
promised ultimate experience of enlightenment. But this teaching reinforces 
the illusion that there is such a thing as an individual who has free will 
and the choice to become.
What is inseparable from the dream of individuality is the idea of 
ownership. "What is happening is happening to me. I have a life called me 
and I can, or even should, do something with my life in the time allotted; I 
have to succeed; I am an individual and personal endeavour can bring me what 
I need." This misconception promotes the continuation of the dream of 
personal enlightenment.
The idea that presumes the possibility that dualistic practices can lead the 
apparent seeker to the non-dualistic perception, is similar to the idea that 
with sufficient effort and determination you can teach a blind man to see. 
To quote "Doctrines, processes and progressive paths which seek 
enlightenment only exacerbate the problem they address by reinforcing the 
idea that the apparent self can find something it presumes it has lost. It 
is that very effort, that investment in self-identity, that continuously 
recreates the illusion of separation from oneness. This is the veil which we 
believe exists. It is the dream of individuality."
(The Open Secret)
Out of all the many awakening that have been described to me, it is 
continuously confirmed that one of the first realisations that arises is the 
seeing that no-one awakens. And yet we see that the majority of teachings, 
both traditional and contemporary, are constantly speaking to an apparent 
separate seeker (subject) and recommending that in order to attain 
enlightenment (object) they should choose to meditate, self-enquire, purify, 
cultivate understanding, still the mind and the ego, surrender, be honest, 
seek earnestly, give up seeking, do therapy, do nothing, be here now, and so 
on . . . the ideas are as endless and as complicated as the mind from where 
they are generated.
These recommendations arise from the belief that the "enlightenment" of the 
"teacher" has been attained or earned through the application of choice, 
effort, acceptance or surrender, and that other seekers can be taught to do 
the same
Of course there can be nothing right or wrong with earnest seeking, 
meditation, self-enquiry, understanding and so on. They are simply what they 
appear to be. But who is it that is going to choose to make the effort? 
Where is the effort going to take the apparent chooser to? - where is there 
to go if there is only oneness?
If there is no separate individual there is no volition, and so how can an 
illusion dispel itself?
There is no person that becomes enlightened. No-one awakens. Awakening is 
the absence of the illusion of individuality. Already there is only 
awakeness, oneness, timeless being, radical aliveness. When the dream seeker 
is no more it is seen (by no-one) that there is nothing to seek and no-one 
to become liberated.
Here is oneness, the realisation of wholeness that cannot be attained or 
owned. This is the awakening in which the awareness of what is arises 
together with the dreaming of that which cannot be known. There can be a 
dance between dreaming and being, and in that dance there can be a return to 
the fascination of personal ownership.
However, the realisation that the dream seeker is also oneness is 
liberation, the uncaused, impersonal, silent stillness which is the 
celebration of unconditional love. This is all there is.
There is no me or you, no seeker, no enlightenment, no disciple and no guru. 
There is no better or worse, no path or purpose, and nothing that has to be 
achieved.
All appearance is source. All that apparently manifests in the hypnotic 
dream of separation - the world, the life story, the search for home, is one 
appearing as two the nothing appearing as everything, the absolute appearing 
as the particular.
There is no separate intelligence weaving a destiny and no choice 
functioning at any level. Nothing is happening but this, as it is, invites 
the apparent seeker to rediscover that which is . . . the abiding, uncaused, 
unchanging, impersonal silence from which unconditional love overflows and 
celebrates. It is the wonderful mystery.
Tony
