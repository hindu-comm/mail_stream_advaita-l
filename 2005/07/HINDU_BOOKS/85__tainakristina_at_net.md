I'm so sorry for the short notice but i've been so busy I almost forgot 
to write to you. I am coming to Finland from July 9 - July 18 to speak 
at a technical conference at Technical University of Helsinki. I 
remember you wanted some books, records, and such things and if you give 
me a list of what you want, I'll try to bring some. I am going to be 
really busy but if you give me your postal address, I'll mail them to 
you when I am there.

Dear Jaldhar,

Thank you very much for your good think to help me with Hindu things! 
How sad thing; I have been problems to read my email daily and I found 
your message only today and you have already travelled away from 
Finland! So it is now too late.

I have read short Sri Ramana's text in which have selected verses from 
Yoga Vasishta, Ribhu Gita, Shankara's works etc. I only wanted to read 
more widely. I have heart there have more book about Yoga Vasihta 
available. Also Kaivalya Naveeta interest me. I also like veda books, 
agamas etc. Also I have interested Indian classical music, upanishads 
chanting, mantras. My difficulties is I am not regular work so I have 
now possible to pay my shoppings by credit card. There have no 
Hindu-books and music available in Finland.

But I hope if someone from this list will posible visit in Finland 
he/she would kindly info me so I would sent list of items and pay my and 
I would pay my shoppings to sender's bank-account.

I really love Hindu scriptures and culture, music, sometimes I think to 
living in Finland my ability to reach scriptures etc, are rather more 
difficult regarding I have to read very slowly and safe dictionary book 
to could understand scriptures clearly. But during many years I have 
learned to read and write english rather good.

I have earlier succed to get two Shiva Cd's which I bought my earlier 
friend's credit card. They sounds so powerful I listen them almost every 
day.

I wanted to ask: Have available words to shiva music. Same is with 
upanishads, expecially taittiriya upanishad. So I would follow singing 
and chanting. Somehow I have learned them but some words I don't hear 
clearly so I cannot repeat them in correct way. Maybe there have webpage 
from which I would find sanskrit words which have for example wrote in 
this mode "mokshatam mouna, narayana namo namah.." I cannot read 
original sanskrit letters.

Forexample thesekind: Features:

Shiva Manas Puja

Bhavanyastakam

Shivoham

Atmastakam

Lingasthakam

Om Nama Shivaya


I am sorry my bad english, sometimes I have feeling I cannot say what I 
mean but hopely you understand even some way.

with best wishes

taina
