Dear all,
  Let me summarize my understanding on this topic based on all your kind replies :-
  Matter/jatam  is also spirit/chaitanyam  but with a name and form for a certain period of time and occupying a certain space. We should learn to see the chaitanyam/spirit behind all matter and not get stuck by the name and form which are perishable in time. Once we gain this shift of perspective and begin to see the imperishable within the perishable (including ourselves), we have become immortal since the only destruction that can happen ever is to the names and forms and never to the contents. Even science agrees that matter can never be destroyed and can only be changed from one state to another.
