According to advaita VedAnta, Reality is always a non-dual unity.

The problem is Perception. It is due to avidyA or ignorance of the Self that
the One Reality is perceived as a multiplicity.

The "rising above matter" that you speak of should be interpreted as
"dissipating ignorance of the Self".

By contrast: sAMkhya believes that reality consists of two primary principles -
Purushha or consciousness and PrakR^iti or matter. Pesent-day Western
philosophers are moving towards a kind of Dualism akin to sAMkhya, where there
are two kinds of substances - Matter and Mind. This is because they've come to
acknowledge that there are mental experiences like pleasure, pain, etc. that
just cannot be reduced to the physical.
