Also interesting is the use of silk which is produced by boiling live silk worms in boiling water.  Silk was popular in Vedic times and I think was used by ancient rajas and rishis. Was there ever an outcry against this ?

It is interewting to note here that Lord Buddha permitted his followers to take meat if the followers do not see the animal being killed or hears its cries during the killing and if the animal is not specifically killed for the followers.

is it not the case that such skins are obtained after the animal undergoes a
natural death?

My question is regarding the use of any arbitrary leather good available in the
market for personal use - including cases where the leather comes from animals
that are reared for the specific purpose of manufacturing leather by
deliberately killing and skinning the animals' hides. Is the use of even such
leather permitted in our dharma?

It seems rather counter-intuitive to suppose that dharma permits the killing of
animals for our pleasure of using leather, so I'd like to see an authoritative
quote on the topic.

Thanks,

Kartik
