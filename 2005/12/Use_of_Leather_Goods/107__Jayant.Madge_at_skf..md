Hrishis in RAMA AVATAR and previous were using VYAGRHA AND HARINA charma.  
 Up until now also some of them are still using.    Was that not leather.  
 During thread ceremony HARINA charma is also knot on YADNOPAVIT. 


Please enlighten further.


Best regards,
Jayant.

Subject
[Advaita-l] Use of Leather Goods






Is there a prohibition against the use of Leather goods (such as shoes) in 
any
of our shAstras?

Or has any well-respected authority on dharma prohibited the use of 
Leather for
everyday use?

Thanks,

Kartik
