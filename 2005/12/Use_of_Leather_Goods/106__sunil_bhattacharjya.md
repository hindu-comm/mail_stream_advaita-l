Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya,

  Drums with leather top are allowed to be taken inside a temple but  shoes are not allowed like  in an orthodox household we do not  take the shoes inside the house. Use of leather from dead animal, after  proper processing, is to be used. Animal should not be sacrificed for  its hide.

  Regards

  Sunil Bhattacharjya

of our shAstras?

Or has any well-respected authority on dharma prohibited the use of Leather for
everyday use?

Thanks,

Kartik
