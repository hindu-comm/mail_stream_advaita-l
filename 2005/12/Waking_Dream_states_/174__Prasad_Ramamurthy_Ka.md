Adi Shankara could tell this because he was not in any of these states. Even
though it would be logical for us to say that  he too had experienced all
these states. It is known that he had the *absolute* state of conciousness
where absolute cannot be explained.

P.S:

How far it would correct on our part to adjudicate one state being in the
other ?

Regards.

Prasad Kadambi.
