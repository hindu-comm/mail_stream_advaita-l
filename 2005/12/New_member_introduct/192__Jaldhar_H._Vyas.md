Hello,

   Thank you for the welcome letter.

I am Lalethaa Ganesh.An MBA by profession, I chose to be a housewife to 
pursue my hobbies and improve on my spiritual knowledge to inch towards 
the Goal and try arduously through sadhana to reach it.

I am an ardent devotee of GODDESS MOTHER and my tutelary God is Lord 
Muruga. I follow my own discipline of chanting the shloka every morning 
and believe discipline is God. I was a Yoga instructor till recently but 
continue to practise the same at home. I have a thirst to learn more about 
vedas and Adi shankara's philosophies to be precise. I have read the 
English translation of Shankara's Vivekachudamani , the Tripurarahasya, 
teachings of Paramacharya, Swami Shivananda and Ramana Maharishi.

I wish to learn more from the experienced, by being a part of this 
discussion forum.

Thank You.
