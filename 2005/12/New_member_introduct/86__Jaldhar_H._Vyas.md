Namasthe,

   As requested by the Administrators of this group, here is my introduction:

   I am a Tamil-speaking Smartha. We are followers of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti 
Peetam, but are also greatly devoted to Sri Sringeri Sharada Peetam and 
Sri Adishankaracharya Sharada LakshmiNarasimha Peetam, Hariharapura.

   Even though belonging to the lineage following Shankara Sampradaya, I do 
not have much knowledge regarding Advaita-Vedanta. I only sincerely pray 
for the benevolent grace of the Sathguru, without which I will be deep 
down and drowned in the mighty ocean called Samsara.

   'Sri Sacchidanandagurum Pranatosmi Nityam'

   Regards,
   Karthik
