Dear Sirs,

  My name is S.N.Sastri. I am now 83 years old. I was an officer in the
Government of India. After retirement in 1980, I settled down in Chennai ,
where I am residing now.

I have been a student of Advaita Vedanta for the past twenty years. I have 
been studying Vedanta under two traditional scholars, Dr. Goda 
Venkateswara Sastri and Dr. R. Krishnamurthi Sastri.

I have authored the following books:-

1.  English translation of Narayaniyam of Melpathur Narayana Bhattatiri, 
with explanatory notes bringing out the Vedantic import of the verses.

2.  English translation of Hastamalakiyam of Hastamalaka, one of the four 
disciples of Bhagavatpada Sankaracharya, with explanatory notes.

3.  English translation of Sri Sankara's Satasloki with elaborate notes.


4.  A Vedantic interpretation of some of the episodes in Srimad 
Bhagavatam.

I have recently created my own website-- http://www.geocities.com/snsastri

where I have posted several articles on Vedantic topics.

I came to know about your website by chance only yesterday and I felt that 
I could make some contribution to your discussions.

                      Yours faithfully,

                       S.N.Sastri
