Dear Amuthan:

Thanks a lot for giving energy into this series.

Arjuna is not fickle minded, but he is in a state of despair and
grieved over  the perceived consquences (due to attachment - rAga). 
And the word untrained/trained could mean many things. May be the
summary can be modified to  "An ignorant person is vulnerable to adopt
adharma in the garb of dharma".

This ignorance may manifest in many different ways, such as, rAga, dveSha etc.

Thanks again.

Ravi
