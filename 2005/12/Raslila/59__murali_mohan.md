It is an acknowledged fact that for a male sadhak the greatest obstacle is attraction of the opposite sex and maybe same for female sadhaks also. We have examples of even eminent sages like Viswamitra who got carried away watching the dance of damsels like Urvashi etc and leaked in his loin cloth and started a family. While that is the case with sages, what to say of less developed human beings ? 
  For a wordly person the mind gets controlled without thoughts of lust only during activities such as listening to scriptures, bhajans etc , then why provoke his mind with these kind of incidents in the very same scriptures?  Are there not enough such provocations in the real world? Can one understand "divine love" only with such incidents?
