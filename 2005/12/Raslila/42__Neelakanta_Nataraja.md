Its very clear from Bhagavata that, it was not a physical activity.
Raasalila was not done by Krishna himself. It was just a dream of
Gopikas. And according to Brahmasutra bhashya, there is no paapa
associated with the thoughts and actions that happen in the dream.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Raslila

  Can someone pls explain this Rasalila from Bagavatham - was it just a
midnight dance with gopis or something more physical? I could understand
the other events from Bhagavatham but never this one. Why was it reqd at
all - i mean this midnight love making with a group of married women ?
No other Avatar has done anything so --------.
  My other religion friends are making fun of these things and I would
like to explain to them. Pls help!!
