His Holiness Paramanada Bharathi cannot clarify you regarding this directly
as he does not use e-mails. I think Abhishek can clarify you further in this
regard as he can speak to Swamiji. But Paramanada Bharathi had clearly spoke
to us (Abhishek , Jaldhar, Praveen Bhatt and myself) that as far as Ras is
considered it was indeed a dream for all the gopi's and we cannot derive
anything as it was not Lord's divine play. I hope to get back to you for
more clarifications.

Regards.

Prasad Kadambi
