Namaste,
While we met Swami Paramananda Bharathiji this subject was broached. He
confirmed that this was indeed a dream as indicated by the word "tejasvi" in
the description of rAsalIla. It is a fact that Atma is described as
"taijasa" in dream state. Perhaps the other members (Vyasji especially)
could elaborate on this as my explanation may not be sufficient?

Regards,
Abhishek
