Shree Murali - PraNaams.  

I am afraid I cannot answer your question since it is difficult for me
to probe into somebody else's mind to see what his/her swadharma is or
should be or should have been.  

The anlysis that is given is only ment for retrospection and
self-analysis.  Question that pertains is only how far I am able to play
the role effectively.  I tried to point out that one has to evaluate
one's swadharma  and not try to evaluate others', since that I consider
as useless pursuit and no way helps in one's growth. 

At least that is my understanding. 

Hari OM!
Sadananda
