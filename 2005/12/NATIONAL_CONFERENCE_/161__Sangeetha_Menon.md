Conference theme:
Today often the issue that gathers focus inspite of its evasive nature, in discussions on consciousness, cognition, or even advancements in nanotechnology and biotechnology, is ‘experience’. The last few decades have seen tremendous achievements in not only creating new technologies and theories to understand life, nature and universe, but also have brought back the human factor into discussions. Consciousness studies is one area that has emerged a significant one in bringing disciplines together as well as posing the challenge of the ‘binding problem’ of subjective experience. The puzzle how neural, discrete and quantitative processes give rise to consciousness that is subjective, unitary and qualitative has expanded the domain of consciousness studies to include as many different forms of human experience and ways of knowing. Do experience and the way we understand have significant roles in altering our ideas about consciousness? 

According to Thomas Kuhn the late historian and philosopher of science much of what we learn, including science, is by example. When we learn by example we learn how to do something not necessarily knowing everything that is involved in doing it. Michael Polanyi termed this kind of knowing ‘tacit knowledge’ where we do not fully know what it is that we ‘know’. So, is knowledge tentative and related to how far we extend our paradigms? Is the concept of ‘what is knowledge’ quite different in the sciences, humanities and arts? What is the role of ‘experience’ in influencing knowledge systems? 

The theory of emergence emphasises that the phenomenon of emergent order deals with organization, with the higher levels showing new properties that are not evident at the lower levels. The unique properties and behaviour of complex systems arise from how the parts are arranged and interact. These properties and behaviour cannot be fully explained by breaking that order down into its component parts. Considering this inherent non-reducibility, how do we understand a complex phenomenon like consciousness and subjective experience? What is complexity?

This conference will address the persistent puzzles and attempted solutions in consciousness studies, developments in cognitive sciences, and the distinct ways of knowing and experiencing in science, philosophy and the arts in the context of the Indian discourse. It is hoped that such a discussion will help to examine the emerging trends in these areas and also explore the place of ‘experience’ in knowledge systems.
