advaita (non-dualism) is one particular interpretation of vedAnta.
others include vishishtadvaita, and even dvaita and sankhya.

advaita as a philosophy started taking shape as a concrete entity with
gauDapAda (Sankara's guru's guru). (but i think it started being
called advaita only later on) But ofcourse advaitic thought can be
argued to exist since vedic times atleast. Sankara has been its
brightest proponent as the interpretation of choice.

As I understand Vedanta means end of Vedas and is the crux of the teachings in Vedas such as tatwamasi etc. Advaita is basically non-duality. Did Advaita as a philosophy exist before Adi Shankara? Or is it nothing but Vedanta in a different form?
