|| Namo Narayana ||

Dear All,

I have been wondering on the concept of 'mUrti prAna pratiShthA'. Which 
mantra's are recited during the puja. I guess the Yajur Veda is recited but 
which mantra's and sookta's and recited?

Also if it isn't a problem would it be possible to e-mail me the relevant 
mantra's or sookta's.

Thank you in advance for you help and guidance.

Krunal Makwana
