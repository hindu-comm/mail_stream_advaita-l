Namste:

  Dr. N.R. Waradepande wrote a Research Monograph entitled, " The 
RgVedic Soma", (1995) Published by the Sanskrit Bhasha Pracharini Sabha, 
Nagpur

  Conclusion: 

  1.  Soma is unmistakeably hemp and it's derivatives marijuana and 
hashish.

  2.  Many hymns referring to Soma in R^igveda have multiple meanings, 
one referring to drink & Smoke and the other to the Moon.

  Regards,

  Dr. Yadu

  Re; Question from Shri Krunal Makwana re-yajna


Soma is a plant. The juice obtained by crushing the leaves of this 
plant is
poured as an oblation into the fire. Yajnas are being conducted even 
now in
some places in South India as well as North India.
