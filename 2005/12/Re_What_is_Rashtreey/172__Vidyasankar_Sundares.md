>From the reference to Padma Subramaniam, I can only infer that this has 
something to do with Bharatanatyam dance. In which case, the connection to 
Advaita Vedanta would be tenuous at best, while the attribution to 
Vidyaranya would be highly doubtful. I have the same skepticism about a 
musicological text called sangIta sAra, also attributed to Vidyaranya. After 
all, Vidyaranya need not have written about every activity in the court of 
Vijayanagara.

A general note of caution - The 20th century has been especially fecund in 
"reviving" and "rediscovering" so many things in various Indian traditions. 
In many of these cases, I wonder how and why none of the transmitters of the 
said traditions (whether religion or philosophy or music or dance) seem to 
have had any knowledge of them between the 15th and 19th centuries. More 
often than not, the supposed revivals cite texts that have been "lost," 
although parts of them seem to be mysteriously available to a select few.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
