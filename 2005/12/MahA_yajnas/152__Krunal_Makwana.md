Dear Jaldharji,

I have been hearing various people 'talk' about yajnas but when they are 
asked what is the true meaning behind the yajnas, they change the subject or 
they don't know.

Can i ask yourself and the rest of the scholars on the advaita post to give 
a brief on:

Soma Yajna: What are the ingredients on this yajna? What is Soma, is it a 
plant, an animal? Who performs them? Why is a Soma Yajna performed? Is it 
performed to this day?

Ashvamedha Yajna: What are the ingredients? Is a horse really used, and if 
it is used, what is it used for? Who performs the yajna? Why is is 
performed? Is it performed today?

Shishyaste'ham,

Krunal Makwana
