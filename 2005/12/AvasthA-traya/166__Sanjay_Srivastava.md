The statement would be true only if it is made by the avasthAtIta purusha.

However all this debate is being done by the abhimAnI of
jAgradavasthA. For him, jAgrat and swapna cannot have the same level
of reality. When transacting his vyApara in jAgradavasthA, it would be
inconsistent for him to hold the jAgrat and swapna at the same level
of reality.
