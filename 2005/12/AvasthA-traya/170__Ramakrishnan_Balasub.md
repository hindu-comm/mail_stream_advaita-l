The examination of three states and "equality" of dream versus waking
has nothing to do with whether one is realized or not. As a matter of
fact, if someone is examining the three states regarding equality or
inequality (whatever that may mean), it is clear that he is not
realized, since he has accepted the existence of the three states. A
critical examination of the three states presumes the existence of
three states. A j~naani is someone who has gone "beyond" these "three
dreams" as described in the aitareya upanishad. He does not see any
"states" or anything else. Indeed what can one see and through what?
(BrhadaaraNyaka).

As far as the quote from Sri Ramana goes, there is nothing there which
contradicts what I said in my mail.

I don't have enough time right now. Hopefully at a later date I'll
clarify thses points in detail.

Rama
