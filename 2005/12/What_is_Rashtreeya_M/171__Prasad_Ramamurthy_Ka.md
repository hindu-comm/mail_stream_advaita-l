Namaste,

I Would beg you all to pardon *me* if this mail is being repeated as I had
problems mailing the group.

I remember reading about Rashtreeya Marga, a tradition  that was started by
Madhava Vidyaranya of Vijayanagara fame and recently I noticed  that Smt.
Padma Subramaniam was instrumental in reviving that tradition, what is this
tradition all about?

Regards

Prasad Kadambi
