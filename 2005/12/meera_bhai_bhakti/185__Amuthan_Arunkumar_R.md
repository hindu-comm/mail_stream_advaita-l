it is best not to compare giants like mIrA bAi or
chaitaNya mahAprabhu or gopikA-s with normal people.
if someone has the capability to akhaNDa nAma
sa~nkIrtanam or bhagavatsmaraNam as these prema
bhakta-s did, there is nothing wrong in discarding
prescribed duties. otherwise, all the vihita karma-s
have to be done.

we cannot insist that all j~nAni-s should have the
same external behaviour. janaka performed his duties.
ramaNa maharShi did not. rAmakR^iShNa paramahaMsa was
doing prema bhakti all the time etc. 

as shrI sadAnanda pointed out, we have to look for
perfection in our own actions. whatever mArga we have
chosen, we can take one j~nAni in that mArga as a role
model and keep going. it is total waste of our time
and energy trying to question the actions of j~nAni-s.

what protest do you expect from a set of bhakta-s who
carry tampUra against a set of armed mughals? 

i really do not see any rationale behind comparing
shivAji and a group of bhakta-s. are you trying to say
that the bhajana should not have happened at all and
that these bhakta-s should have taken up arms against
the mughals?

why are you trying to find fault with the bhakti
movement when it has produced giants like mIrA,
chaitaNya mahAprabhu, kabIr, tulasidAs, nAmadeva,
tukArAm etc.? 

the absurdity of the conclusion against bhakti
movement will become apparent if we consider an
analogy with present day politics. today we have a lot
of corrupt politicians. does this mean we should not
have any political science or politicians at all?

both are correct. but for those who do bhajana, vihita
karma-s HAVE TO BE DONE. if by mahatkR^ipA or
bhagavadkR^ipA prema bhakti develops, all karma-s will
drop away by themselves. 

one final piece of thought - i'm no one to advise you
but i felt i had to tell this to you - instead of
asking 'why did 'X' do this? is it not wrong?' (where
'X' is some mahAn), it is better to have the attitude
''X' did this. therefore it is correct. but there
seems to be a contradiction. how can this be
understood?'. vinaya is any day preferable over fault
finding. 

in case you asked these questions with the right
attitude, please forgive me for my presumptuous
remarks. i wrote this since your attitude in this and
your previous post on rAsa lIlA seemed more fault
finding than as a proper question.
