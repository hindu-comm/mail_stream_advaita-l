Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya,

  So you agree that without being disciple of a traditional guru   (ie. of a guru from a traditional guru lineage) one can become  like  what Ramana Maharshi and Nityananda Swami had become. Then  what prevents a modern guru from becoming like any of them? I find it  difficult to accept  your  sweeping statement that the   non-traditional gurus are no good. It would have been more convincing  if you would have given a few examples of the modern gurus, whom you  consider to be fake.

  What do you mean by " I would not be faulted"?. Can you elaborate.

  Regards 

  Sunil Bhattacharjya

Not really. Some of them may indeed be excellent social workers or
good psychotherapists -- if only they gave up the facade of teaching
spirituality and concentrated on their core competencies.

I am confused why you put Ramana and Nityananda in the same category.
Ramana was not a new ager by any standard. His understanding of
tradition and shAstra were flawless and his credentials were
acknowledged by no less than kAnchI mahAswAmigal.  Note that peer
review is an important part within tradition.

Since I do not know much about Nityananda Swami, I would desist from
hazarding a guess. Though judging from the teachings of his disciple
Swami Muktananda, I would not be faulted, if I did.
