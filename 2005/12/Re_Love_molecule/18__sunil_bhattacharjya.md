Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, 

  Do you mean to say that all the modern gurus are fake?

  Secondly Ramana Maharsi and Nityananda Swami, the guru of Swami  Muktananda, did not have any guru,  They were all not from very  long past. Do you want to call them fake also?

We don't need to. They are doing it themselves.

Look at the profundity of their teaching-- "religion-banana-skin;
spirtuality--banana". "Unconditional love is total; total love is
life; hence live life unconditionally".

Either they are saying what their audience want to hear -- and
therefore they are being cunning.

Or they are saying it because they sincerely believe it -- in that
case they are ignorant and misrepresenting indian spirituality.

Either scenario does not bring any credit to them.

You are right that a lot of traditionally trained gurus are also not
enlightened. But it is difficult to fake enlightenment within
tradition.  There is an objective standard to know whether a teacher
is enlightened or not. And the teacher is not alone in his tradition;
he has his peers too. For a student willing to invest some time,
detecting a traditional fake is easy. Whereas, with a modern guru, he
does not need to have any tradition behind him, no objective criteria
and no peers. He can continue to teach -- "known is actually the
unknown and unknown is unknowable" for a life time without ever being
caught.
