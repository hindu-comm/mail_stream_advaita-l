Not really. Some of them may indeed be excellent social workers or
good psychotherapists -- if only they gave up the facade of teaching
spirituality and concentrated on their core competencies.

I am confused why you put Ramana and Nityananda in the same category.
Ramana was not a new ager by any standard. His understanding of
tradition and shAstra were flawless and his credentials were
acknowledged by no less than kAnchI mahAswAmigal.  Note that peer
review is an important part within tradition.

Since I do not know much about Nityananda Swami, I would desist from
hazarding a guess. Though judging from the teachings of his disciple
Swami Muktananda, I would not be faulted, if I did.
