very true. it is very easy to misinterpret advaita and
start deluding oneself to be a j~nAni. once shrI
rAmakR^iShNa paramahaMsa said that people are more
interested to become teachers, but no one is willing
to be a student! i personally feel that one
traditionally trained vidvAn can impart more knowledge
than all the "new-age" guru-s put together.
