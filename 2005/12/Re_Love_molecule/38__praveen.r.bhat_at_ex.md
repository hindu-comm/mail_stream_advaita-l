When the author first went to meet Sri Punjaji, he was surrounded by his twenty "enlightened" disciples. The author mentions that he seemed to be the only "un-enlightened" person in the room at that time.

praveen:
Could you please confirm if this is from "Nothing ever happened" or elsewhere? David Godman, in his series of interviews, has mentioned that Poonja Maharaj many a times said "you're enlightened" to many a people, but when David specifically asked  for the no. of his followers who are enlightened, the number was hardly any! (I know one of the close Poonja followers who has had a glimpse of enlightenment, but doesn't claim so. There may be many such)

(Strictly speaking... rather, IMHO... Poonja Maharaj could hardly be considered a modern master. He gives credit of his enlightenment to his guru, Ramana Maharshi)
