This reminds of Arjuna's question in the gItA (2:54)
"*sthita-prajnasya ka bhasa* *samadhi-sthasya kesava* *
sthita-dhih kim prabhaseta* *kim asita vrajeta kim"

"How do you recognize someone who is in this (enlightened/jnAni) state,
Krishna? How does one in this state speak? How does he sit? How does he
walk?*"

Perhaps the stitaprajna verses follolwing this (2:55-2:70) are the answer.
Do all modern jnAnis pass the Lord's litmus test? Questions to ponder....

Regards
-Krishnan
