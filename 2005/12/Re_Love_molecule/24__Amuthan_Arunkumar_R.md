my point is that it is a lot more probable to find
fakes among modern guru-s than among the traditional
ones. my comments were on the major lot of the
moderns, not all of them. (and btw, i never claimed
that all traditional guru-s were j~nAni-s at any point
in my mail.)

i'm sorry if my statements offended you.
