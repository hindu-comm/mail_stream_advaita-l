Not a few. There are legions of "enlightened" masters after Osho,
Punjaji and Balsekar. While no one has claimed enlightenment after
Krishnamurthy, there is at least  one very prominent disciple of him
who has claimed "explosions" of creativity through "observing the
observer". Then there are others who have had experiences of
"thousands suns exploding" and "cosmic orgasm" through various new age
techniques.

In his autobiography, Madhukar Thompson has given a graphic detail of
his meeting with Sri Punjaji. When the author first went to meet Sri
Punjaji, he was surrounded by his twenty "enlightened" disciples. The
author mentions that he seemed to be the only "un-enlightened" person
in the room at that time. Then there were others like him who were
waiting to be "enlightened". There was yet another category of
statistics junkies who had all the data about average time taken in
"enlightenment" after meeting with master, their segregation by age,
nationality, race.. their mean, variances etc.. The author says he
felt like-

"THE ENLIGHTENMENT HORSE RACE HAS BEGUN AND THE WINNER IS...."
