I do not see what is the connection here. There is nothing to suggest
that getting recognition either living or posthumously is the criteria
for jnAna. There have been jnAnis like krishnAswAmi Iyer, kAnchi
mahAswami, raman, tapovan mahAraj, chinmayAnanda, tArAnanda, dayAnanda
etc. who got recgnition in their life; and there have been several
others who were never known either in life or posthumously.

On the contrary to your observation, I would argue that most of the
jnAnis we know, were recognized in their lifetime itself. Though I do
not want to suggest that it proves anything.
