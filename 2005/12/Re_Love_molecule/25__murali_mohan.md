Dear all,
  I think all this classification such as traditional and modern is against the spirit of Advaita. Why go by time periods when time itself is within maya!! The sufis/mystics were radicals who did not go by "tradition" and believed in direct experience. Anyone who can make things clear in current circumstances with current examples can be appreciated. People such as Deepak Chopra, Ramdas etc  has been instrumental in bringing a lot of intelligent persons, who otherwise would not have gone near any traditional guru or scripture either for lack of time or disbelief, interested in spirituality by explaning things in a language they can undrestand and appreciate.. Not everyone will have the time to go through the ardous traditional method of learning for years sitting with a guru. Of course one should beware of fakes but that is true in any field at any age.

my point is that it is a lot more probable to find
fakes among modern guru-s than among the traditional
ones. my comments were on the major lot of the
moderns, not all of them. (and btw, i never claimed
that all traditional guru-s were j~nAni-s at any point
in my mail.)

i'm sorry if my statements offended you.
