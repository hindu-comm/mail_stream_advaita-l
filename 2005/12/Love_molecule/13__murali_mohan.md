I don't have much details, just read it in the papers. But the question that haunts me is whether terms such as "Universal Love", "Unconditional Love" etc which are now-a-days used quite frequently by the spiritual leaders and new-age gurus - are they not just emotions again and hence at the mental/material level? Is it not totally different from the nature of the Brahman which loves or hates nothing in particular and hence is neutral?

  Pranams:

Can you please clarify:

Have they discovered that when a person is in love, the molecule is present
OR
Have they discovered that if this molecule is injected, the person falls in
love and naturally, the next question is, if so, with whom does he or she
fall in love?

If the former, I think it has been addressed in the previous mails.
If the latter, it would indeed be interesting if you can answer the second
part of my question.

Thanks

Humble Pranams, Mahesh
