Dear Dr. Yadu and others ,

Pranaams. 

Sorry for the very late reply in the discussion. In the context of the
meaning of Yagno vy Vishnuhu ... , I would like to add an interesting
fact ....

There was a real hard Agni upaasaka during the time of the greatest of
all greats of sanyasis, Sri Chandrashekhara Bharathi's (Sringeri)period.
The upaasaka did not even know that there was such a sanyasi, when he
visited Sringeri. Jagadguru gave thirtha and he just had a look at him.
Some time after the upaasaka boarded one of the lodging rooms in
Sringeri, one of the parichaaraka of the mutt came to him and conveyed
this message to the upaasaka :

"There is a separate arrangement made for you and your upaasana. Please
follow me and stay in that place." In the same evening, the upaasaka met
Guruji and surprisingly asked him, how do you know that I am an
upaasaka, to which the HH told him that, by looking at you, one can tell
that you are such a great upaasaka. In that context, he told Yagno vy
Vishnuhu .... Meaning that you are Vishnu .... Because you do so much of
upaasana.

BR,
nattu

Thank you sadnanada-Ji:

  This is one of thsoe practical advise for our ancestors that applies
to all the situations that is why Lord KR^iShNa declares himself as
being yaGYana.

  In rudraadhyaaya (dashama anuvaaka)

  ##garbhaashcha me vatsaashcha me travishcha me travii cha me
dityavaaT.h cha me dityauhii cha me paJNchaavishcha me
paJNchaavii cha me trivatsashcha me trivatsaa cha me

  aayuryaGYena kalpataaM

shrotraM yaGYena kalpataaM mano yaGYena kalpataaM
vaagyaGYena kalpataamaatmaa yaGYena kalpataaM 
yaGYo yaGYena kalpataam.h  || anuvaaka 10\.1||

  Meaning - I will acquire (#.....#) by performing yaGYa through prana,
apaana, vyaana, caxu, shrotra, mana, vaaNii, aatmaa, and yaGYna.

  Note: Here this becomes clear if we intrepret the word yaGYana as
efforts and that is why puruSha suukta concludes with a statement
yaGYena yaGYanamayajanta devaa sthaani dharmaaNi prathamaanyaasan.

  Whether it is kR^iShNa or shivaa/rudra the key operative word is
efforts.

  That is why R^igveda the declares "na R^iite shraantasya sakhyaaya
devaaH (4.33.1)". Also R^igveda qualifies that Gods do not help the
meaningless (artha-shuunya) academic (just for the sake of doing work)
efforts  "na mR^iShaa shraataM yadvanti devaaH (1.179.3)".##

  Just some thoughts.

  hariH OM tat sat,

  Dr. Yadu

I think that is the primary meaning. The vishu sahasranaamaavali also
says He is yajnaH| 
yagno yajnapatiryajnvaa yajnaango yajnavaahanaH| 
In Geeta Krishnaa says as the essence of karmayoga - yajnaartha
karmaNo2nyatra loko2yam karma bandhanaH| tadartham karma kounteya
muktasangaH samaacara| It could mean - do the action for Vishnu
otherwise one will get bound by the action - He is pleased when one
offers whatever one does with an attitude of surrenderance - yat karoshi
...tat kurushva madarpaNam||

Hari OM!
