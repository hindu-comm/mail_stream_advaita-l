Dear Dr.Yadu,

Sorry for the late reply. The meanings of the mantras are as follows :

1. Ato devaa --- May the Gods protect us from that portion of the earth
whence Vishnu put his steps aided by Seven meters.
2. Idam Vishnu --- Vishnu traversed this universe; 3 times he planted
his foot and the whole universe was collected in the dust of his
footsteps
3. Treeni padaa --- Vishnu, the uninjurable and the protector of the
universe. Stepped 3 steps, there by preserving the sacred Laws.

These are the bhavaarthas. It clearly says about Vaamanaavataara. If you
look at the third mantra, it says about sacred laws. Sacred laws in the
context means all the dharma karyaas and karmaas we would do. The karma
could be Agnihotra, Oupaasana and the like. There is a specific
reference to Agnihotra in this mantra, so that, it mandates us to
worship Agni in one or the other forms. That's why we have Agnikaarya
for Brahmachaaris, Oupaasana for Grihasthaas and if possible to keep
Agnihotra. This will make the person really strong in his karmaas.

To support this statement, there is another quote in Taittiriya
Brahmanam , Ashtama prapaathaka :

Yagnou y Vishnuhu |

Meaning - By doing Agni upaasana, one will become Vishnu himself ! What
a statement !

Yagneshwaraya namaha,

BR,

Namaste Neelakanta Nataraj-Ji:

  It is extremely creditable to what you already accomplished.

  Could you please comment on the medhaatithi kaNva - viShuu suukta
(1.22.18)

  What I have been trying to understand the significance of
vaamanaavataara and why we worship vishNuu and how this relates to the
vaasiShTa's viShNuu suukta that you have quoted.

  ato\' de\`vaa a\'vantu no\` yato\` viShNu\'r vicakra\`me |\\
pR^i\`thi\`vyaaH sa\`pta dhaama\'bhiH || {1}{022}{16} 
  i\`daM viShNu\`r vi ca\'krame tre\`dhaa ni da\'dhe pa\`dam |\\
samuu\'Lham asya paaMsu\`re || {1}{022}{17} 
  triiNi\' pa\`daa vi ca\'krame\` viShNu\'r go\`paa adaa\'bhyaH |\\
ato\` dharmaa\'Ni dhaa\`raya\'n || {1}{022}{18} 

  Thank you and look forward for your enlightening incites.

  Regards,

Dr. Yadu

  Yagneshwaraaya Namaha !

Please do not call me Sir, since I am too young to be called so. Its
always due to the efforts my parents put to keep us in this line and
ofcourse, Esha's blessings. Its our sincere responsibility to learn
Vedas :

Vedah shivah shivo vedaha vedaadhyaayi sadaashivaha|
Tasmaat sarva prayatnena vedameva sadaa japeth||

Ok, here it goes. There are much better learned people in this list, but
still to the benefit of others, I would like to quote few things from
Vedas :

In Rigveda, Vishnu suktha (7th mandala 99th suktha), 2nd mantra is as
follows:

Nate vishno jaayamaano na jaato deva mahimnah paramantamaapa|
Udastabhna naakamrushwam bruhantam daadartha praachim kakubham
pruthivyaah | 

Meaning - There is no one alive who knows the Vishnu mahimaa. One who
knows about it in the past will not be born , one who comes to know
about it will not be alive (attain mukti).

In the next Suktha, Maharshi Vasishtha says :

Tantvaa grunaami tavasamatavyaan ...

Atavyaan means a layman. Vasishta, in praise of lord, says that, he
(Vasistha) is a layman. When Mahaan rishi like Vasishtha says so, can we
think that we know something ! It's a great thought to ponder over.

Parameshwaraaya Namaha.

-nattu
