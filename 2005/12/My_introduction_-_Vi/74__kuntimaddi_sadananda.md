I think that is the primary meaning.  The vishu sahasranaamaavali also
says He is yajnaH| 
yagno yajnapatiryajnvaa yajnaango yajnavaahanaH| 
In Geeta Krishnaa says as the essence of karmayoga - yajnaartha
karmaNo2nyatra loko2yam karma bandhanaH| tadartham karma kounteya
muktasangaH samaacara|  It could mean - do the action for Vishnu
otherwise one will get bound by the action - He is pleased when one
offers whatever one does with an attitude of surrenderance - yat karoshi
...tat kurushva madarpaNam||

Hari OM!
