praNAm all,

To me, this is actually the beauty of the Gita.  It is aimed not at the perfect but the ordinary people like us.  We are all in a similiar situation as Arjuna.  We want to do the right thing but our deluded natures get in the way.  But if Arjuna can receive the grace of God, we can rest assured that there is hope for us too.

praveen:
That goes very well with what you said while at Bangalore: we do strive to be perfect and if we can't do the best, we don't do any! So if we start by assuming that Gita is only for the perfect, I'm sure that eras will pass in our effort to become perfect first and then bringing Gita into our lives. IMHO, Gita itself brings perfection into our ordinary lives. So there's no second thoughts about Bhagavan's teachings for the ordinary.

(We did have a thread on what people think on why Arjuna was chosen by Krishna, if someone wants to look up more.)
