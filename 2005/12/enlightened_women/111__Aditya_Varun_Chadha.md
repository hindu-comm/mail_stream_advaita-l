Greetings,

Can someone please point me towards some examples of and sources
pertaining to jnAnis who were / are female in their "last worldly
life" or the life during/at the end of which they were enlightened?

Is Gargi an example? Any in other eras (more recent/ancient)? Is there
any significant vedAntic literature authored by females? For that
matter is there any significant ancient "Indian" literature authored
by women?

I would like access to any such literature, as that is a perspective I
have not yet come across (although that only suggests something about
the shallowness of my own knowledge)
