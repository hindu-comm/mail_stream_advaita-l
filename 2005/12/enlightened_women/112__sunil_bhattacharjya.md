Om Namo Bhagavate vasudevaya, 

  Gargi was definitely one. Chudala of Yogavasishtha is another. Some  people consider Madam Blavatsky as one. Annie Besant, who introduced  Gandhiji to Bhagavad Gita, strange though it may sound, is also  considered by many as one jnani woman of modern times. There may be  many but they prefer(ed) to lie low and not challenge the male ego.

  Regards

  Sunil Bhattacharjya

Can someone please point me towards some examples of and sources
pertaining to jnAnis who were / are female in their "last worldly
life" or the life during/at the end of which they were enlightened?

Is Gargi an example? Any in other eras (more recent/ancient)? Is there
any significant vedAntic literature authored by females? For that
matter is there any significant ancient "Indian" literature authored
by women?

I would like access to any such literature, as that is a perspective I
have not yet come across (although that only suggests something about
the shallowness of my own knowledge)
