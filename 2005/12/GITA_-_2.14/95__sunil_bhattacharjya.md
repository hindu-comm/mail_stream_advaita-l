Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya,

 As regards  the source of that information you will find in  Matsya purana  that Lord Krishna was 79 years old when the war started. As per  Bhagavat purana Lord krishna passed away at the age of 125 years and  that was 36 years after the Mahabharata war. Arjuna was a few years  younger than Lord Krishna. According to another source Arjuna was 2  years older than Lord Krishna.

 The mention of the age was to  say that Arjuna was not an uneducated young boy. He had learnt all the  sashtras including vedanta. That is why at end of the  Bhagavad  Gita Arjuna spoke " My delusion is destroyed and I have gained my  memory, through your grace."

  Sorry I could not get the website you stated. Can you paste in your reply.

I was wondering about your source for the above statement and also its
relevance to Arjuna being an uttamadhikari for receiving instruction of the
gItA. Surely age is not the primary criterion to be ready to receive
instruction on Vedanta.

Apologies for going off-topic. The Mahabharatha chronology of Dr. Patnaik
(Google's cache of the page is
http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:8dcxEBRzR_YJ:madhva.org/vms_mi/htm/Mahabharatha.htm+arjuna+age+mahabharatha&hl=en)
seems to suggest that Arjuna was about 89 years age when the war started.

Regards
-Krishnan
