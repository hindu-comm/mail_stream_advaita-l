So there was nothing wrong in  Arjuna's getting the highest Vidya directly
from the Lord

  praNAms
  Hare Krishna

  Interesting point here to be noted  is despite getting highest vidyA from
  bhagavAn himself, arjuna could not maintain this wisdom for a long time!!
  again he succumbed to *shOka-mOha* and ahaNkAra during post kurukshEtra
  period...his assertion at the end of gIta *nashtO mOhaH smutirlabdA*
  holds good only at that particular point of time & it appears that
  arjuna's realization was temporary & definitely it was not Atma jnAna of
  highest order which is eternal & beyond space & time.  That is what Sri
  VidyA prabhuji also confirmed in his reply to me :

  // quote //

  His doubt vanished regarding the battle he was due to fight, and his duty
  was clear. He did not claim to have all root avidyA removed, nor is it
  said
  so anywhere in the Gita.

  Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
  bhaskar
