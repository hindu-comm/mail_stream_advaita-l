I would like to welcome the following new members to the list, along with 
their introductions in their own words.

Regards,
Vidyasankar

Sthanunathan Ramakrishnan - Iam a smartha by birth but I would like to know 
more about our tradtions, how and why it's different from that of 
SriVaishnavas or Madhvas. I have dabbled a bit in reading up Advaita 
philosophy as well and have read many of the past discussions in this forum.

Shobha -  I am a woman in my thirties, mother of two, and a physician. I 
live in the united states.  My philosophy is to say,hear, see  or do no 
evil.  My interests include music and reading.  I particularly enjoy reading 
Hindu scriptures  and I keenly follow many of the ongoing discussions in the 
group.  I would be privileged to be part of the group.

Sudhakar - I am working as a software engineer, hyderabad, age 28. I am 
interested in learning Sanskrit, Nyaya, Advaita etc. It happened to me that 
I have read some of your articles, which are very good and interesting, so I 
request you to include me in the mailing list. Thanks in advance.
