    (MS's bhAShyam on this verse is quite long and
involves a refutation of views of various schools of
thought. the essence of the argument is that the self,
being the 'revealer/illuminator' of objects like the
intellect, mind and the world etc. (the
'revealed/illumined'), is different from and
independent of that which it reveals and hence is not
affected by various qualities of the
'revealed/illumined'.)


  My humble doubt is : how can the self be "different" and "independant" from all that it reveals? Is not the self all prevading and nothing other than brahman and brahman is all that there is ? Is not the intellect, mind, world etc also in brahman only?
