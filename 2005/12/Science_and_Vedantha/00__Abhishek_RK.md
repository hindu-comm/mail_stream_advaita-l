I am sorry to disagree here. That great minds of this human race have not
been able to do so even to this day of Wednesday 30th November 2005 is proof
enough for me that such things cannot be inferred or guessed at. Also you
say "What can be inferred is that "there are some things that are true but
cannot be inferred"". This just gets into an "infinite loop" if I have your
meaning right.

Well such a "reality" is really a bunch of thoughts. Vedanta asks us to look
for the very source of such thoughts!

That we are getting "doubts" is proof enough that we are on the right path!
