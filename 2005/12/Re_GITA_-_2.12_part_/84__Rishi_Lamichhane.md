Dear Sri Amuthan Arunkumar,

Thank you for your reply.

There are two issues here as I understand it. One is the internal
consistency in Advaita. The other is whether that scriptural passage
is Advaitic or not.

When we reply to alleged internal contradictions within Advaita, we
can use the Advaita system's basic presentation. I don't think its
appropriate to saying the opponent's position does not arrise because
all phenomena are non-arrising, since thats just a logical trick. I
will try to explain what I mean.

Sri Ramanuja's objection Advaita metaphysics was essentially, how
could Sri Krishna, who does not perceive duality, teach? He is trying
to expose an internal contradiction in Advaita, it is a reductio ad
absurdum.

So what Sri Ramanuja is saying is that "Assume what the Advaitins say
is true. If that is the case, there is such and such contradiction.
Therefore what Advaitins say is not true."

If the contradictions don't follow from the Advaita position, then
Ramanuja has not shown that Advaita is contradictory. So it is
perfectly rational and perfectly standard to reply to such objections
using Advaita metaphysics.

Vyavahara is another issue, but (please correct me if I wrong) was not
in your mail so I didn't reply to that.

The other issue, now.

Ramanuja might also say "What is your proof for Advaita"? This is
another question which Advaitins should be able to answer, but its a
different one. This is asking for proof of Advaita. Here, according to
tradition the proof for Advaita is Shruti, not logic and in this case
Ramanuja also accepts Shruti so using it is valid. I can think of two
quick arguments that generally will put the non-Advaitins on the
defensive. They will come up with objections but they will be a bit
far-fetched.

One has been pointed out Sri Bhattacharjya. Sruti often says that in
the beggining, there is nothing but Brahman, or Brahman was one
without a second (Ch. 6.2.1, Ait. 1,1,1). Its not just that many of
the Upanishads say so, even the Nasadiya Sukta says this. Sruti and
Smriti also says that the Self is eternal (the non-Advaitins also
accept this). If the Self is eternal, it always existed. In the
beggining only Brahman existed. Therefore the Self is Brahman.

Another nice argument is based on Gaudapada's argument for ajativada
with a kind of gloss from myself (because of my contamination the
argument may be flawed, please tell me if you feel it is so).

Sruti does often say that everything is Brahman (sarvam khalvidam
brahma). Other than possibly Sri Anandatirtha, all the Acharyas also
accept that there is nothing outside Brahman (ie: Brahman is the
whole). Sruti also says that Brahman is partless (this is accepted by
all Acharyas I believe).

Since there is nothing other than Brahman, something outside Brahman
cannot arrise. Since Brahman has no parts nothing can arrise within
Brahman. Since Brahman itself is unborn, it cannot arrise. Since
nothing arrises in Brahman and nothing arrises outside of Brahman, and
Brahman does not arrise, nothing arrises.

I think the first argument is less complex, therefore more solid than
the second. The only way to refute it is to gloss over  the passages
in Sruti which say that in the beginning there was only Brahman.

The other thing more generally is what Mandana Mishra says
(paraphrased from memory, please correct me if appropriate): "If other
positions are established, that doesn't negate Advaita. If Advaita is
established, all other positions are negated." Dualistic statements
are a part of teaching Advaita, but non-dualistic teachings are never
a part of teaching dualistic positions. A single Advaitic statement in
the Upanishads is all proof that is needed, and there are plenty more
than a single one,

Regards,

Rishi.
