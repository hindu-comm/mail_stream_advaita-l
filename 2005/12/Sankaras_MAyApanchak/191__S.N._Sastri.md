Sub: SrI Sankara's  mAyApancakam

The concept of mAyA is the central pillar of Advaita VedAnta. It is what
makes the changeless, all-pervading Brahman appear as the ever-changing,
limited world of objects. SrI Sankara has composed five beautiful verses
describing the wonderful things that mAyA does. These verses have been given
in devanAgari script with English translation in
http://www.geocities.com/snsastri

under the heading 'MAYAPANCHAKAM'.
