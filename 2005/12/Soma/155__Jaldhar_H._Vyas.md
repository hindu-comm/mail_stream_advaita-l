I doubt it.  Soma is described as a valli (creeper.)  Furthermore Soma was 
pressed to extract its juice.  The hemp plant is not pulpy.

However it is hard to say because the nature of the true Soma plant was 
lost and a substitute (pratika) is used in yajnas.  This has been the case 
for a long time.
