Namaste Sadananda-ji. Thanks for your series on karma-yoga. It
clarifies many points.

I have a doubt though regarding offering of karmas to Lord.

I would presume that only that can be offered to Lord, which is
appropriate for offering. I do not go to temple to offer garbage to
Lord. When Lord has declared certain actions as nishiddha, does it
make sense to offer those very actions to Lord? Apparently, lying to
sell is not the same as lying to save ones life. Moreover, does this
approach not give us license to continue with our adharmic behaviour
shifting burden of responsibility away from us?

I would be grateful if you can elaborate this point further.
