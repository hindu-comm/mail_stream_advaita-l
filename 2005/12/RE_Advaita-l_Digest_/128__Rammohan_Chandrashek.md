Hi, This is the my confirmation for the subscription to the Advaita list.

As to my introduction, I am Santhosh, 26 years, working in Mumbai 
presently. I am very much interested in topics related to Hindu Gods and 
the various rituals and practices. However, I am except for the famous 
stories that one hears about the Hindu Gods. I am joining the group so 
that I can get more knowledge in these matters.

Thanks.
Santhosh

  Can someone pls explain this Rasalila from Bagavatham - was it just a
midnight dance with gopis or something more physical? I could understand the
other events from Bhagavatham but never this one. Why was it reqd at all - i
mean this midnight love making with a group of married women ? No other
Avatar has done anything so --------.
  My other religion friends are making fun of these things and I would like
to explain to them. Pls help!!
