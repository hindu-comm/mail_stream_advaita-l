  I for one don't agree with ISKCON philosophy. They sound so much like christians or muslims who belive in a physical personality called God and scare people in the name of eternal hell. ISKCON philosopy is so far removed from Advaita. It was initially founded to attract american hippies  and wean them away from drugs and other vices. 
  Purely dualistic. Just 5 simple tenants to follow which itself was a great change of life for the westerners.  I think it is still applicable only for such people who cannot directly understand or appreciate Advaita philosophy. They give too much importance to a person or avatar called krishna (name and form) and not to the theory he expounded.
