I am not propounding/refuting ISKON philosophy.. But I do believe that
they have a point to make [wrto the current discussion]. I am just
pasting below an interesting extract from the same.

"When we consider the rasa lila in its appropriate spiritual context,
free from human moral judgment, we can gain entrance into the interplay
of divine love between the Lord and His devotees. Such divine love
should not be criticized or copied. It should be respected and
worshipped ".

  I for one don't agree with ISKCON philosophy. They sound so much like
christians or muslims who belive in a physical personality called God
and scare people in the name of eternal hell. ISKCON philosopy is so far
removed from Advaita. It was initially founded to attract american
hippies  and wean them away from drugs and other vices. 
  Purely dualistic. Just 5 simple tenants to follow which itself was a
great change of life for the westerners.  I think it is still applicable
only for such people who cannot directly understand or appreciate
Advaita philosophy. They give too much importance to a person or avatar
called krishna (name and form) and not to the theory he expounded.
