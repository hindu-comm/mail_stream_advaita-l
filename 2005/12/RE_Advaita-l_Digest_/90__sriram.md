Dear All
I will say that births are not accidental and Sri Krishna answers Sri
Arjuna`s query thus:Ch6Slokas40to44.That a devoted sadhaka who slips from
yoga never falls to a state inferior to what he has already gained and he
takes birth in families conducive for his further perfecting the Sadhana
.Actually he will begin exactly where he left.That is how we have great
souls who walked on this earth like colassuses eg.AdiSankara,Sri
Ramana,Ramakrishna Parmahamsa,and a host of other Great souls.Therfore we
can conclude that our swadharma is determined by our births and it is upto
the individual to follow it or flout it.Birth in a coducive environment
itself is an indication what is one`s swadharma.We are given human births to
strive for obtaining final liberation and if we waste it who is to be
blamed?-(Viveka chudamani Verses1 to 5)
R.Krishnamoorthy.

dharma, we  believe that our births are not accidental. Depending  on our
past karma and the consequent unfulfilled desire we take birth  in
particular caste or in particular economic or  intellectual environment.
Therefore it is required of us to to fulfill  these obligations  that occur
due to birth in a particular  situation. Then of course we can go beyond
that after fulfilling the  obligations.
