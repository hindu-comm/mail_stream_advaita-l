  This "interplay of divine love" is far far removed from physical love. Even the joy one derives from leading a pure and clean life both mentally and physically is far ahead of the 1 minute joy of physical love making which is preceeded and succeeded by immense sorrow. Then why use such play and emotions as an example or to denote divine love? Does it not set a bad example to laymen (for example we have this police officer in UP dressing and acting like a female love-lorn radha and dismissed from service and Vrindavan is filled with prostitutes in the name of religion) ? I have seen so many movies and songs depicting this vulgarly and also this serves as an excuse for many for their shortcomings. Human beings love to imitate and hence role models has to be very careful about their actions in the physical plane, like say Lord Rama. Rama was also capable of doing anything and was all powerful but look at his actions - not one wrong move.

"When we consider the rasa lila in its appropriate spiritual context,
free from human moral judgment, we can gain entrance into the interplay
of divine love between the Lord and His devotees. Such divine love
should not be criticized or copied. It should be respected and
worshipped ".

I for one don't agree with ISKCON philosophy. They sound so much like
christians or muslims who belive in a physical personality called God
and scare people in the name of eternal hell. ISKCON philosopy is so far
removed from Advaita. It was initially founded to attract american
hippies and wean them away from drugs and other vices. 
Purely dualistic. Just 5 simple tenants to follow which itself was a
great change of life for the westerners. I think it is still applicable
only for such people who cannot directly understand or appreciate
Advaita philosophy. They give too much importance to a person or avatar
called krishna (name and form) and not to the theory he expounded.
