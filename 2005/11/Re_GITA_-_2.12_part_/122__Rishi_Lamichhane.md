I tracked down a nice story I had found in a website which tells many
short stories involving Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati of Sringeri. I
think it is extremely clear and answers Ramanuja's objection
appropriately:

"Once a gentleman from Bengal who had heard of His greatness came to
Sringeri. He had expected that His Holiness would be engaged in
Samadhi for most of the time, completely oblivious of the world.
Consequently, he was astonished and disappointed when he saw His
Holiness performing His morning Anushthana and worshipping the Divine
Mother later on. However, he did not doubt the greatness of His
Holiness but found it hard to accept that a Knower would engage
Himself in ritualistic worship of images. He desired reconciliation
and at an appropriate occasion mentioned this to His Holiness Himself
in an indirect manner, "If a person has Atma realization as propounded
in the Advaita Vedanta, can he properly engage himself in rituals or
in image worship?" His Holiness asked in answer, "What else do you
except him to do?" Had the gentleman answered this question with any
other alternative then that would have been equally inconsistent with
the state of the realized soul. He therefore replied by saying, "I do
not mean to say that he should do anything else. My difficulty arises
this way. Doing anything, be it rituals or image worship or even study
of scriptures implies the sense of doer-ship. Are not these two
attitudes inconsistent with each other and, if so, how can they exist
at the same time in the same individual?" His Holiness said, "Quite
true. Two things, which are mutually contradictory, cannot exist at
the same time in the same entity. Can you tell me, who the non-doer
is?" "Of course, the Self." "Quite right. You have studied our system
well. Will you now tell me, who the doer is?" "Certainly, it is the
body, the senses, the mind and the intellect." "Quite right again. The
Self is the non-doer; and the doer is the non-Self. Is it not so?"
"Yes." "Where is the inconsistency now? Doer-ship and non-doer-ship do
not inhere in the same entity." This line of simple reasoning made the
gentleman realize the absurdity of the question in the first place and
when he parted from His Holiness he was more devoted to Him than ever
before."

Regards,

Rishi.
