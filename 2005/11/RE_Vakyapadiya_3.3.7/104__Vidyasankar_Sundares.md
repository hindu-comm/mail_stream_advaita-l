Yes, the gist is substantially correct. The fonts used to transliterate must 
have been rendered differently in different people's browsers, but one can 
make out the words. The second half of verse 3.3.71 talks of the state where 
(yatra) the seer (draShTA), the seen (dRSya) and the seeing (darSana) are 
not differentiated (avikalpitam). The first half of verse 3.3.72 says that 
only (eva) the reality of (satyatva) this state (tasya) is stated by those 
who know (vedinaH) the vedAnta (trayyanta). The term trayI is often used to 
refer to the vedas, so trayI + anta = trayyanta = veda + anta = vedAnta.

If I remember right, maNDana miSra quotes this portion of vAkyapadIya in his 
brahmasiddhi,

Regards,
Vidyasankar
