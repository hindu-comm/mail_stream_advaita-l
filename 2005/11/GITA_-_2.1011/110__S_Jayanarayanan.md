One more (better) interpretation I've heard:

The English word "mocking" is not a good translation (rather, a very
poor translation) of Sanskrit "prahasan". The latter is NOT a derisive
smile, while the former usually is.

Krishna is smiling at Arjuna in the same way that a father smiles at
his child crying due to an insignificant problem (like the child's toy
not working at the moment). The father knows it's a trivial problem
that can easily be fixed and does not require tears. His smile
therefore is at the child's innocence/ignorance, but without any
derision associated with it.

Krishna's smile is that of one who is in complete control of the
situation, and smiles at Arjuna for thinking otherwise and giving way
to grief.
