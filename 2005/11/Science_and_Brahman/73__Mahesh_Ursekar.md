Pranams:
 While I agree to your claim that science *so far* has been able to answer
more how's and less why's, I am curious to know how you adjudge that Vedanta
answers the 'why's' of science. Can you explain or let me know where or how
Vedanta answers the questions you have raised:
 - why does the telephone behave as it does?
- why is there day and night?
- or the general question - why are the laws of physics as they are?
 Many thanks,
 Humble pranams, Mahesh
