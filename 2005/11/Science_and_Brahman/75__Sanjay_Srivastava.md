Why should veda talk about them? What has physics to say whether Akbar
was a good king or bad? Vedas are here to teach us about dharma and
moksha. In the process they might make occasional reference to other
branches of knowledge but that is beside the point. Veda has a
different subject matter. It does noes compete with other pramANas. If
it did, either the other pramANas will be redundant or veda will be
redundant.
