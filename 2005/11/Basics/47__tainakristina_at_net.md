I am very interested about Yoga Vasishta book! Unfortunately there have 
no available scripture books in my country in Finland, therefore I have 
to dry to ask about bookshops in other countries. Would you give some 
bookshop address from where I would purchase this books. I wanted to get 
just most wide version as available. I have read short verse which I 
purchased from Ramanasramam when I visited there. When I read it I felt 
I want to read more. I am also interested about other advaita-vedanta 
books and veda-books other hindu-scriptures. So if I would get address 
of bookshops.

with regards

taina
