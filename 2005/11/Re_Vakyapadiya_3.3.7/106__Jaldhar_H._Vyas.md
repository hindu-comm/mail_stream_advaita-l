Mandana Mishra was quite familiar with the vaikarana darshan.  He has also 
written a work called sphotasiddhi which deals with aspects of that 
philosophy.

I have read that the Buddhist Dignaga quotes Bhartrahari.  This would 
indicate Advaita Vedanta was flourishing as early as the 5th century. 
Tradition states that Bhartrahari was a courtier of king Vikramaditya and 
if we accept that, it pushes the date all the way back to the 1st century 
BC.
