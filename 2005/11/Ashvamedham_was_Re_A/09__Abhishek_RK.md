 I agree that this "meditiation" is for those of very pure minds. An example
is: those in LKG cannot understand the teachings of say 10th standard. At
present I must say we are in LKG in the field of vedic learning. So at
present better concentrate on learning the mantras, then comes using them in
karmas and learning their meaning! Sri Chandrasekara Bharati Swamiji says
that Sureswaracarya was of such pure mind because of performing *all* the
karmas to the tee that he was able to grasp the Acarya's teachings as soon
as enunciated by the Master.

 At present I am using the sasvara krishnayajurvediya taittiriya braahmanam
published in kannada script in two volumes with the kathaka bhagam from the
Ramakrishna Matha, Bangalore. They have also published the samhita in three
volumes. However for the aaranyaka I have taittiriya yajurvediya yajuranyaka
published by Sri A N Gangadhara Shastri in Sri Vidyaganapati Prakasana,
Thyagarajnagar, Bangalore. Prapaathaka is used for the sections of the three
ashtakas of the braahmana whereas prashna is used in both the samhita and
aaranyaka texts.
 Regards,
Abhishek
