I also mentioned that this logic cannot be used for obligatory karmas
like agnihotra. The general rule is that the knowledge of the deeper
meaning of the karma (see for example what the horse is described as
in the ashvamedha braahmaNa) and recitation of the mantras are
sufficient to get the same benefit as performing the karma. But the
particular rule is that it is not so for the obligatory karmas. For a
higher level of saadhakas mere meditation of the non-obligatory karmas
is sufficient. It all depends on the mental maturity. See the brahma
suutras in the third adhyaaaya, part 4 and shankaras commentary on
them.

Meditations usually have no particular rules like the ahitaagni. That
doesn't mean anything because no one can do meditation properly unless
he follows yama, niyama, and a host of other stringent practices. So
of course there are "rules" even for these meditations. And of course,
it's difficult to control the mind and meditate. But that does not
mean one shouldn't try. Any one can try to meditate, but whether they
are successful depends on many things than just merely sitting in some
place.

prapaaThaka and prashna are usually used to denote the same thing. In
some old grantha texts I have seen prapaaThaka being used instead of
prashna in the samhitaa, but not the braahmaNa or aaraNyaka. I am
curious, can you give the details of the book which you use for the
braahmaNa?
