 I had thought that meditation substituted for the rite itself imposes very
strict rules on the yajamana. I had read in the shrouta list that the
aupasana agni can be "transferred" into one's body (as opposed into a samit)
but this requires brahmacarya etc to be followed. Also in the shankara
digvijaya we read Sureshwaracarya "transferring" his agnihotra "internally"
before taking up sannyasa. My point is: this meditative performance of
certain karmas is much tougher and probably not recommended for beginners.

 Thank you for this information. Presently I am learning the second
prapaathka of the first ashtaka. I assume prasna is same as prapaathaka?
 Regards,
Abhishek
