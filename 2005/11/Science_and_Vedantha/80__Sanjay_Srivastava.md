It seems there is a fundamental confusion here about the subject
matter of Advaita. The subject matter of advaita is the "self' -- the
ultimate subject that can never be objectified. No analysis or
reasoning or observation is possible of the 'self" (or for that matter
any other subject) without making it an object of our thinking.
However, the moment it is objectified by our thinking, it is no longer
the subject matter of Advaita -- it is in essence something
fundamentally different from the subject matter of Advaita.

If reasoning could proceed without thinking, probably there would have
been a way to understand the "self" through reasoning alone.
Unfortunately, at the current level of evolution, human race is not
endowed with such faculty.
