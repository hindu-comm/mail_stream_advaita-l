The meaning is: "That from Which speech returns and so does the mind".

You had written:
"So in the context of advaita, while mental activity is important,
those who reach its pinnacle (Godel is considered one of the greatest
rational thinkers of ALL time) realize that it cannot answer all
questions. Do remember that this is not being said because of "blind
faith", this is being said because there is a mathematical proof for a
formal version of this."

You also say Godel was one of the greatest thinkers of all time. This just
goes to show even the greatest thinkers CANNOT "infer" or even take a wild
guess at even the existence of some "Higher Reality". The only thing that is
inferred from this ever-changing world is that *change* is the "Highest
Reality". Sorry if I mentioned anything out of context.

Regards,
Abhishek
