namo nArAyaNAya!

dear list members, 

i made a typo and left an argument incomplete in the
previous post. i'll correct them here. i'm extremely
sorry for this inconvenience and i'll take care to
avoid it in the future.

errata:

1. in the second note where the adhikAri is discussed,
the statement immediately succeeding [8] in the main
text should be as follows: "...he mentions that the
gItA is not understood properly by laukIka-s and that
he commences his expostion of the gItA to rectify
this. the appropriate reference in G.B. avatArikA is
as follows : "...atyantaviruddhAnekArthatvena
laukikaiH gR^ihyamANam upalabhya ahaM vivekataH
arthanirdhAranArthaM sa~NkShepataH vivaraNaM
kariShyAmi." that BP opines that laukIka-s are also
adhikAri-s for gItA can be inferred only from this
complete argument and not from the incomplete one
given earlier. 

2. in the first note, just before [4] is mentioned in
the main text, the word 'AchChAdanIyam' is mis-spelt
as 'AchChAdanItyam'.

sorry once again for the inconvenience.

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmR^itaH.
