Dear Amuthan and everyone else,

I do not think it is at all difficult to respond to Ramanuja's argument here
(at least the non-scriptural one). There might be some cases where questions
themselves are not appropriate, but if Advaitins start using this fact to
answer to all objections, then it could easily be a coverup for irrational
arguments.

When we say Krishna teaches Arjuna, we have to consider what we mean by
"Krishna." Krishna, truly, is Brahman (not just Krishna, but also Arjuna,
and everyone else). Brahman does nothing (it is actionless), so it is not
Krishna (ie: Brahman) who is teaching Arjuna, it is rather that body that is
teaching Arjuna.

The jivanmukta has no sense of doership and there is no link between the
Atman and any particular body.  The only reason why the body that is
associated with Krishna acts in an enlightened way and the body associated
with Arjuna does not is because the body associated with Arjuna has not
undergone manonasha and so Arjuna's body (so to speak, truly Arjuna is
Brahman and has no body) is still controlled by a mind.

So basically Krishna does not think he is teaching; Krishna does not think
at all, he is just Ananda and the body acts how it will, he just has to Be.
Since there is no mind with raga and dwesha, the actions are always
compassionate and appropriate.

I hope this makes sense, if there is some fault, please do inform me.

Regards,

Rishi.
