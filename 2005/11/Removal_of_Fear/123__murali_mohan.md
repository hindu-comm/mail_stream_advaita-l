  Dear all,
  Now that the scientists has identified the "fear gene" and has produced mice without fear in the laboratory, next they will be producing fearless human beings or pills to remove fear forever. What does all this mean from the vedantic point of view? I thought fear could be permanently removed only by jnana and only realized persons can be totally fearless.
