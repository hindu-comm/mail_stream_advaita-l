Namaste Murali, 

My sincere apologies. I believe two other members have adequately
responded to your queries. Best regards.

Subject: RE: [Advaita-l] Removal of Fear

The question I raised was out of genuine curiosity and not in jest.
Science has been succeeding in proving that all experiences (well
almost) is nothing but chemical reactions in the brain. Does this mean
everything we experience including the so called enlightenment is
nothing but a chemical reorganization in the brain? Am I nothing but a
chemical compound?  Hope some enlightening response is forthcoming.
  I joined this group to tap into the wisdom of others to clear my
doubts. Not to be insulted or brushed aside.

It only shows that we are not mice. And Vedanta is not for mice. 

In a humourous mood,

Dear all,
Now that the scientists has identified the "fear gene" and has
produced mice without fear in the laboratory, next they will be
producing fearless human beings or pills to remove fear forever. What
does all this mean from the vedantic point of view? I thought fear could
be permanently removed only by jnana and only realized persons can be
totally fearless.
