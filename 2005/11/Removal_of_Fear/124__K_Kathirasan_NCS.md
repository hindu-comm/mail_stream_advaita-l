Namaste

It only shows that we are not mice. And Vedanta is not for mice. 

In a humourous mood,

Subject: [Advaita-l] Removal of Fear

  Dear all,
  Now that the scientists has identified the "fear gene" and has
produced mice without fear in the laboratory, next they will be
producing fearless human beings or pills to remove fear forever. What
does all this mean from the vedantic point of view? I thought fear could
be permanently removed only by jnana and only realized persons can be
totally fearless.
