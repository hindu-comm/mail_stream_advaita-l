Dear Amuthan,
 I think it would suffice if you handled Chapter 1 in a summary way.
 I thank you for taking up this 'Learning Gita Aloud' project and admire the
fact that you could do it along with your final year in IIT. Don't be misled
by the lack of response to your posts. The combination of commentaries of BP
and MS has left us all speechless - what can mere mortals add to their
commentaries?
 God bless you.
 Venkat
