praNAms Sri Amuthan Arunkumar prabhuji
Hare Krishna

IMHO,  the first chapter (arjuna vishAda yOga) contained the common
problems (shOka - mOha) all of us  facing today...though we are well aware
of this problem...we are not in a position to  pin point our problem &
resultant suffering...Hence, I request you to write in detail about the
first chapter with the help of scholars commentary on it....I also request
Sri Ravishankar Mayavaram prabhuji to summarise the commentary of Sri
yOgAnanda as it is very difficult to type out all the 200 pages.

While on the subject,  I also humbly request my guruji Sri Vidyashankar
Sundareshan prabhuji to spare his precious some time with us &  guide us
with his invaluable insights on gIta & shankara bhAshya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

PS :  Since you are also member of Sri Satchidanandendra Saraswati group, I
request you to  post your mails parallelly to that list also.
