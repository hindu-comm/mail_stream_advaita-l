i have seen this book (but i didn't venture to read
it!) with one of my friends here at iit about a year
and a half back, but i didn't know that paramahaMsa
yogAnanda has given such a huge commentary on the
first adhyAya. since right now i'm sticking on to
traditional interpretations, it'd be great if you can
carry on a parallel discussion on the gItA based on
paramahaMsa yogAnanda's interpretation (especially the
first adhyAya. i'm quite amazed to know that a 200+
pages commentary exists on that). if you ready to
start this,  i'll provide a quick summary of first
adhyAya and move on to the second. 

let me know of your plans. 

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
