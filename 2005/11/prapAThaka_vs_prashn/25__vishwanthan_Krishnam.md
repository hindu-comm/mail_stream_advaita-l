i have with me a  copy of krishna yajur veda published
by chowkambaa samskrit prathishtan where prapataka is
used (interestingly i purchased this from RS vadhiyar
Kalpathy). On comparing with the TS published by
Krishnamurthy Sastrigal, i came to the conclusion that
prapataka and prasnas are synonymous.

vishwanathan
