 We are not realized, for sure. But it seems to me that we wish to separate
the yin from the yang...
 Do you want to see:
1. missionaries converting hindus to Christianity or
2. millions of hindu kids passing out of catholic schools not knowing any
more about Jesus in doing so?
 Or
1. Hindus and Muslims killing each other on religious grounds or
2. A Muslim president who can quote from the Gita?
 And to bring it closer to home:
1. Brahmins raisng philosophical thought to the summit not reached before
2. Brahmins creating the scrouge we call untouchability?
 So, if we are not realized and since reaching the Absolute where such
differences will cease to exist seems like a formidable task, the best we
can do is to fill our hearts with Love. Universal Love. For love, there is
no opposite. Hate is not the opposte since it requires an object for
survival while Love does not. Love is. Just like Brahman is.
 Humble pranams, Mahesh
