 Om namO Bhagavate rudrAya"

 Sub:- Rudra Namakam – PrathamAnuvAkam

(Rik 3)

* *

* "yA tE rudra SivA tanU raGhora pApakASinI*

* tayA na stanuvA SantamayA giriSantAbHichAkaSIhi"*

 What is appearing in the hridaya kamalam, is itself the aGhOra rUpam, the
non-violent and peaceful form of Siva. "tad viShnOh paramam padam". aGhOra
and the Ghora (nonviolent and violent) forms both are existing there itself
in an inter-mingled condition. Because of the dissolution of mind, identity
of either of them can not be distinguished at all. That is the Siva Sakti
sAmarasyam (the unification of Siva and Sakti). It becomes the same
luminance, the bliss of "*antar bahicha tat sarvam"* the same light every
where in and out. "*Siva Sakti sAmarasya mahAnandAnuBhvam"*. *
"aBhayamaSOkamanantam*", *"sadA paSyanti sUrayah".*

 That is *"pApakAsini"*. It indicates 'kundalinyutThapanam'. (that the
kundalini was awakened.).

 * "giriSantA"* means—*"kailAsE giriSAtmanA jaladHarE parjanya rUpENacha"*,
the prAna Sakti in the Chandra mandalam.
