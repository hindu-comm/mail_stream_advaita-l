 Actually Sanjaya is the ultimate(?) narrator to DhritarAShTra whereas
Duryodhana and others are the ones in the field talking among themselves.
Our purANas and itihAsAs have this feature of being narrated by innumerable
people. In the end it is vedavyAsa who actually puts it in readable form by
compiling them into the 18 purANas and mahabhArata or vAlmiki who composed
the ramAyaNa.

Abhishek
