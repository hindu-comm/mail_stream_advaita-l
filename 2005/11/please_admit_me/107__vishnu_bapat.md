Thank you. My name is Vishnu Bapat. I am an ayurvedic physician by profession. I had a manufacturing company from which I have retired. I am now devoting my time in study of vedanta and social work. I am member of Art of Living and Chinmaya Study circle. I am living in Detroit for 4 months and later will return to India, Bangalore.
