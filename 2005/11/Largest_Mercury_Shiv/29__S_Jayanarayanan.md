Namaste.

Mercury is a liquid at room temperature, so my guess is that it was
amalgamated with another metal so as to make it a solid. For example,
mercury amalgamated with silver or gold is used in dental fillings
that are placed in one's mouth for years, and these pose no health
issues.

Or perhaps liquid mercury is placed inside another solid metal
container. Even so, it should be fine.

It would be interesting to compare this with the Brihadisvara Lingam
in Tamilnadu, which used to be the largest in the world.

Thanks,

Kartik
