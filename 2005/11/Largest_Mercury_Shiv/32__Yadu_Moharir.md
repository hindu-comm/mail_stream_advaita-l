Namaste Abhishek-Ji:

All I am saying that there is a pot-hole on the street.

It is up the individual to know and realize that are potential problems.

If we do not what to acknowledge the problems ands stick to it because it is old then it is our own loss.

There has to be a problem to acknowledge first! We don't even know there is
a problem. IMHO there are enough "scientific" brains even in India to
discuss these "academic issues".




Absolutely, I agree that there are "Scientific" brains in India but are they using it is my question?  As yaskacharya stresses - what is point in having the dry wood (for samidhaa) if we do not oblate it into the fire?  (If forgot the exact quotation). Understanding utility is important.  That is what we try to achieve when we practice yoga, meditation puujaa rituals as advised through shastra.  



We have to realize that we are standing on the shoulders of our ancestors therefore, we can possibly see farther than what they possibly could.  Shastra was created as an empirical rule for guidance and must be continuously evaluated that it still applies to current times.  



They also gave us an important scientific tool of "neti-neti" for evaluating the truth.  So apply to the shastra and evaluate it and then follow if it is found to be correct discard it or make the necessary ammend it if necesary.

If one has realised that truth you enunciate he will not be harmed even if
drinks a load of mercury! The same brahman that is there in you and me is
also in the mercury. Why are you forgetting this? Nevertheless since all of
us are not realised souls we have to live as per the shastras and gather
enough punyam to make our minds pure so that it will be fit to receive
knowledge. Otherwise we wil the biggest cheats- cheating ourselves and
others by claiming to have "realised"!




Living by shastra is a good idea but at the same time we have to realize that it (shastra) was created with only with their existing knowledge at that time.



By following the shastra of old times we are eliminating the refined knowledge that was acquired post formulation of that specific shastra.  In doing so we are at loss.  Our ancestors already ready dead we have to live.  Either we can live is the confined BOX of shastra or we can realize the limitations of that BOX.

Well sir this does not seem such a big problem as to take the extreme
measures you advocate. But it seems some people have ideas of their own as
to what is "culture" and what is not. Better they live in such fantasies of
"culture" and leave those who want to live as per shastras alone!




I am only advising that one need to be aware of potential problems before the problems manifest.



Dear friend, we cannot go further if there is no resistance.  It is the resistance between the road and the tire that helps us move further.  A powerful locomotive is powerless on a greased rail tract.  It just spins it's wheels.



I appears to me that you advising us to sit on the fence and maintain the statesco !?  By doing the rituals without regard or consideration to the safety do think we will go anywhere?  If we are on a rocking chair, yes we will move and not go anywhere.



This is my Last post on this thread.

Abhishek
