 There has to be a problem to acknowledge first! We don't even know there is
a problem. IMHO there are enough "scientific" brains even in India to
discuss these "academic issues".

 If one has realised that truth you enunciate he will not be harmed even if
drinks a load of mercury! The same brahman that is there in you and me is
also in the mercury. Why are you forgetting this? Nevertheless since all of
us are not realised souls we have to live as per the shastras and gather
enough punyam to make our minds pure so that it will be fit to receive
knowledge. Otherwise we wil the biggest cheats- cheating ourselves and
others by claiming to have "realised"!

 Well sir this does not seem such a big problem as to take the extreme
measures you advocate. But it seems some people have ideas of their own as
to what is "culture" and what is not. Better they live in such fantasies of
"culture" and leave those who want to live as per shastras alone!

Abhishek
