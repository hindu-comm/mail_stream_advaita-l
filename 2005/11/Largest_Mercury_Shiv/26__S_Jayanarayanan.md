Largest Mercury Shivalingam in the World Created in Ujjain, India 

Siddha Ashram and Acharya Mahamandaleshwara Swami Nardanand
Paramahansa Maharaj have completed construction of a 1500 kilogram
Parad (Mercury) Shivalinga, which is the largest of Sanatana Dharma
(Hinduism). The Shivalinga and its temple are located at Siddha
Ashram, Ujjain, India.

(PRWEB) November 4, 2005 -- Siddha Ashram has completed construction
of a temple that is the first one of its kind in Sanatana Dharma
(Hinduism), as it has a large Shivalinga consisting of 1500 kilograms
of Parad (mercury), the largest in the world. The opportunity to have
darshan, the touch and worship of this Parad Shivalinga is accredited
to one's holy and good deeds done in the previous and present life.
The temple and Parad Shivalinga are located on the grounds of Siddha
Ashram, Ujjain, India.

In Hindu scriptures parad (mercury) is regarded as the best of all
metals. The following it the purport of a sloka from Rasyog
Chintamani:

Sphatik is better than paashan, padmaraaj than sphatik, Kashmir
jewel, pushparaaj, i.e., lahasunia than Kashmir jewel, panna than
lahasunia, neelam than panna, godanti or gomed, mauktik than vidrum,
silver than diamond, gold than silver, diamond than gold and parad
(mercury) is yet better than diamond.

Thus parad is the best of all the metals and jewels and a lingam of
Lord Shiva made of the best of all the metals should without doubt
defy any parallel. Siddha Ashram will provide you a purposeful
opportunity to have a darshan, a touch and worship of Shri
Paradeshwar Mahadev.

Significance of a Parad Shivalinga in Tantra: All the metals and
sub-metals found in the world are sending out their waves. Parad
(mercury) is a metal too and sends out its waves likewise. As parad
is the most unstable among all metals, similarly man's mind is the
most wavering too. Both are closely related. If parad is stabilized
by destroying its unsteadiness, its waves will solidify. This process
causes effect on the mind. If one meditates beside a parad
Shivalinga, the mind naturally gets concentrated. Therefore, a
compact form of parad is of great significance because it is
extremely helpful in concentrating the mind.

The founder and head of Siddha Ashram is Acharya Mahamandaleshwara
Swami Nardanand Paramahansa Maharaj. The focus of the sadhana
(spiritual practices) taught by Swamiji is Kundalini Shaktipat Yoga
Meditation, including practices of Yoga, Vedanta and Tantra.
