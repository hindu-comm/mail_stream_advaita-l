Of late there is a concerted attempt made by certain sections of people to
denigrate our Hindu saints, taking advantage of the Hindus' tolerance. Such
people are merely selfish and do not render any worthwhile service to the
society. Right-thinking people should be vigilant and thwart the evil
machinations of such elements
 Regards,
Abhishek
