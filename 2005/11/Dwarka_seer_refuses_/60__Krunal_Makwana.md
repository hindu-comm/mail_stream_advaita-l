Dear Vyasji,

Thank you for informing us about this incident. As a Hindu living abroad i 
cannot believe such atrocities happen in our own country. When will the 
Indian Government learn and appreciate the culture which has insured it's 
own survival since time immemorial. I feel disgusted of such a government 
which has no regard for it's own people let alone living breathing 
personifications of Brahman. I feel very emotional that these things happen. 
What have our saints ever done to deserve so much pain and embarrassment? 
They have taught the wolrd only to love and the right way of life! But i 
guess society will never learn, they killed Jesus because he told the truth, 
they killed a sufi because he proclaimed 'anal haq' (i am he), they 
massacred the sikh Guru's.

Let this be a lesson to all of ignorant society, the wrong you do today, 
will echo throughout time until haunt mankind!

In the service of true sanAtan dharma

>Sanyas Ashram, Vile Parle. Despite repeated attempts to contact
>Indian Airlines, no airline official was available for comment.
>Speaking to this newspaper, Swami Avimukteshwarananda Saraswati

>aircraft over 225 times till date but never have I had such an
>experience." He added that it was the pilot of Indian Airlines
>flight IC-147 who objected to him carrying the five-foot, eight-inch
>long stick on board the aircraft.
>According to the swami, he had been cleared in the security check
>stage and it was only after he occupied his seat that Indian
>Airlines staff came and requested him to keep the dand in the cargo
>compartment. He refused to part with the dand, saying it is always
>kept with his person, is a symbol of his mutt, and that keeping it
>away from his person would be sacrilegious.
>"The behaviour of the pilot of the flight, which had over 50 per
>cent foreigners, made me feel like I am indeed a terrorist and I
>just wondered what the foreigners would be thinking of Hindu
>saints," the swami said. He said he got off the plane because he
>feared an incident could be created by Hindus on board the plane.
>Swami Avimukteshwarananda Saraswati met senior Indian Airlines
>officials who apologised to him verbally, but refused to issue a
>written apology or refund the ticket. He had to wait at the airport
>for three hours before returning to Sanyas Ashram at Vile Parle,
>Mumbai. "They just want me to forget the incident as a one-off
>incident and did not assure me of anything. Tomorrow, any saintly
>person of the Hindu dharma could face such treatment," he said.
>Swami Vishveshwar Anand, the mahamandaleshwar of Sanyas Ashram,
>said, "The dand is so small that it cannot injure anyone. On
