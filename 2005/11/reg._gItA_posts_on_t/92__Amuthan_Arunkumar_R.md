namo nArAyaNAya!

(i sent this mail earlier, but it somehow did not
reach the group. in case u have received it already,
please ignore this mail)

dear list members,

this is regarding the series of posts on the gItA
(from 1.1 to 2.9.) to be posted. 

1. after some thought on this issue, i've decided to
cover the entire first adhyAya verse by verse.
however, the presentation will be very brief except
for a few shloka-s - the idea is to highlight only the
key issues. 

2. since a lot of english translations are available
online, for the moment, i'll provide the shloka-s only
in saMskR^itam. this will be done for the sole reason
of reducing the mail size. later on, from 2.10, when
one shloka will be taken at a time, i'll provide an
english translation for each shloka. 

3. after quickly covering all the shloka-s upto 2.9,
i'll provide a summary of the main lessons to be
learnt from the first chapter and it's relevance to
our daily life as requested by shrI bhAskar. i hope
that a detailed analysis of the first adhyAya will be
done by shrI ravisha~Nkar mAyavaram in the near future
based on paramahaMsa yogAnanda's interpretation.

4. since the shloka-s from 1.1 to 2.9 provide very
light reading, i'll finish them all at one stretch in
a series of posts. after we enter into the core of the
gItA (from 2.11), i plan to post a mail once in three
days or so.

5. MS provides a lot of additional information like
the definition of a mahAratha etc. in his commentary.
since our main aim is to get to Atma vidyA fast, i'll
be omitting some parts of MS's commentary like these.
(i'm certainly not saying that MS is wasting our time
by giving all those definitions. i'm actually
surprised by the degree of thoroughness with which he
handles the gItA.) 

6. i kindly request the list members to bear with the
large mail sizes. smaller mails will lead to a very
large increase in the number of posts. 

i hope this will be convenient to everyone.

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmR^itaH.
