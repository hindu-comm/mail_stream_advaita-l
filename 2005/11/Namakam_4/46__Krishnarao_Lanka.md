 Om namO Bhagavate rudrAya"

 Sub:- Rudra Namakam â€“ PrathamAnuvAkam

(Rik 4)

 *"yAmiShum girisanta haste biBharShyastavE*

* SivAm giritra tAm kuru mA higimsiih puruSham jagat ||" *

 The disease and the poverty will take place due to the sins committed by
the vAk (bad speaking). *"giritrA"* means he who protects us from such bad
vAk.

 The bow in his hands is the symbolic representation of death. That should
never be desired by any one.

 *"astavE"* = *"hantavyABhimuKhEna kincha kripayA trAyaswa pApaischa mAm"*
kAma, krodHa etc., will damage my brahma chaitanyam ( devine vital
forces). Such
things should not enter into my mind.

 Because the *girisanta* always protects my speech (vAk), your *"iShu"* the
arrow, which is the symbol of death, will become passified and does not
cause any harm. Desire for long life only will rejuvenate the bloom of
chaitanya. Never we should yearn for death.

 *"giritra" *= 1) protector of the three kUtAs of the mantra

2) Protector of the chariot like body (jagat), by amplifying the . Shat
chakras. ( the chariot of Siva is mEru giri )

(This universe is the chariot for Siva)

 *"puruSham jagat"*= Our body, which enjoys all joys and sorrows.

 *"SivAm kuru" * = make it peaceful

* "vidHEhyAdarAnniirOgam nirupadravam cha satatam srii rudra sAmba praBho"*
