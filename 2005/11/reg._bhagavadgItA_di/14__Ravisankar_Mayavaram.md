Dear Amuthan:

Please start. It does not matter even if someone else is  posting
those same verses and subject such as, bhagavad-gItA is worth
repeating. I will also try to post something from next week. Even
after  pArthiva year ends we can still continue to carry on this
discussion.

We no longer have any bhagavad-gItA specific posting guidelines. But
we have not posted a formal withdrawal of the guidelines.

Thanks.

Ravi
