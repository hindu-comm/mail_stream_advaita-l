Greetings Praveen ji,

Thank you for the information! It may sound naive but I did not know
of this final authority of Sruti. That makes perfect sense though,
Sruti is the basis of all philosophical commentaries after all. Well
that narrows it down to a few thousand vAkyas, lol:-) But you know
what, believe it or not you have just inspired me to start reading the
vedas! (till now I have only read some upaniSads and those too without
much discipline)

But you are probably right, it is probably quite impossible for me to
'minimalize' Sruti!! But maybe I'll try to see some things in Sruti
texts themselves that are inter-derivable. Thanks!

Aum.
