I suppose by normal state I meant the state is which one returns after
coming down from the exalted state of Samadhi. It is not normal in the
sense of being similar to what is experienced by the average
individual but normal in the sense that one is aware of world as seen
by average individuals.

How can Samadhi be a lower goal? Without Samadhi all jnana is merely
an intellectual pursuit. Like Sri Ramakrisha said, the empty vessel (a
jnani) makes a lot of noise but once it is full (has experience of
Samadhi), it is silent. Another way of looking at it is that if
Brahman cannot be described in words or experienced by the senses, how
will mere intellectual knowldege of get you close to understanding it?
