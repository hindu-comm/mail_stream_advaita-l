praNAm all,

Sorry, while also being glad, I can't keep off the topic :)

Agreed. But since most of the expressed views by Sanjay and you are
traditional in this new age forum, may I also add that the study of vedAnta,
IMHO, is *traditionally* not done without an initiation into sanyAsa? In
such a case, taking any of the *other* steps (one being probably better than
the other), is still not *true (read, traditional) study of vedAnta*!
(Others, please feel free to bash me up on limited understanding :)

Both ways is true... Guru being God, he takes a hundred steps towards you
(only) when you take a step towards him.
