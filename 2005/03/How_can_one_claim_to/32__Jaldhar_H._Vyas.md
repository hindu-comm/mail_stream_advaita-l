On the contrary if I (or you etc.) cannot know Brahman than this is all
gibberish and we are wasting our time with Advaita Vedanta.  What you are
asking for is agnosticism.  And God knows there are plenty of agnostics in
the world but why put fancy Sanskrit wallpaper on it?

Doubt whether what we think or no is really true or merely superficial is
good but it has to be placed correctly.  I remarked here earlier that this
Vedanta is not "one" it is "not-two" because "two" is the natural state of
most peoples understanding.  "Two" has to be negated through doubt and
then and only then you get "one"  So I use "I" because it is reasonably
certain to me that "I" exists.  "Mahesh" whom I have never met could for
all I know be a clever artificial intelligence programmed to simulate a
person writing to advaita-l.  How can I know?

What is the difference between a philosopher and a master?  Was
Shankaracharya a philosopher or a master? Both? Neither?   How about,
let's say Jagannath Shastri?  How would you know?
