Example of "love" is not appropriate in this case. No one contests that love 
is a feeling to be felt rather than something to be understood. This is not 
true of Brahman. If at all, it would be more appropriate to compare it with 
the knowledge of moonlight or rising sun. Moon does not have light of its 
own; or sun does not actually rise or set; are facts to be understood rather 
than felt or experienced. True understanding of moonlight and rising sun 
validates our experience but also transcends it and explains it from a  
higher platform. Knowledge of Brahman is the ultimate understanding where 
all the pieces of puzzle fit together. This understanding may bring with it 
a feeling of exhiliration or eureka, however this feeling itself is not the 
understanding of Brahman. Regards.
