[Not to be construed as "bashing"!]

In the upadeshasaahasrii, part 2 of the prose section, the model
student enquiring the teacher is presented as brahmachArin.

In the prashna upanishad bhAShya, sha.nkara points out that while
knowledge is accessible to people in all 4 stages of life, it is more
difficult for householders since they may have to resort to lies or
adharmic things to sustain a family. So, knowledge is mainly
accessible to the people in the other 3 stages. In any case, it's
certainly not only for people in the sanyaasa aashrama.
