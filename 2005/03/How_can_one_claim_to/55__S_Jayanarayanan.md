It is true that traditionally non-sannyAsins have studied
VedAnta. If the GItA can be considered a VedAntic text (which it
is), arjuna is an example. So was appayya dIkshita. But it is
equally true that tradition has placed great emphasis on
sannyAsa for a student of VedAnta.

H.H. Chandrashekhara Bharati taught that IDEALLY, study of
Vedanta ought to commence only after taking sannyasa:

---
Disciple: ... does it not amount to saying that if a
person without the four prescribed qualifications
takes up the study of the Vedanta it is quite wrong?

H.H: What doubt is there? That is why the Sastras say
"saMnyasya shravaNaM kuryAt.h" "Study the Vedanta
after taking Sannyasa".

In the case of non-sannyAsins, study of VedAnta is not
prohibited. However, the GYAna obtained by the study of VedAnta
by these people (including the BrahmachArin of the
upadeshasAhasrI, householders etc.) has to be supplemented by
vidvat sannyAsa for the GYAna to be established firmly.
