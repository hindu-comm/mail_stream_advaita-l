If one "returns to the normal state" than one has not realized Brahman at
all.  For Brahman is not a state but the very ground of truth,
consciousness, and bliss.  Samadhi is a state and oneness can be felt
during that state (because the vrttis of the mind that cause the
experience of duality are stilled) but it not an eternal state.  (The mind
becomes disorganized again.)  So in Advaita Vedanta, samadhi is considered
a lower goal than jnana.  Unfortunately, many modern interpreters are
heedless about this distinction and cause confusion in the minds of
sadhakas.

Yes because we do have some idea of what consciousness is, what truth is,
and what ananda is.  What we don't have in samsara is _pure_ experience of
these things.  To get this is the goal of Advaita Vedanta.  Without the
pure experience of Brahman even these things appear to be tainted by
defects like falsehood, turmoil, and sorrow.
