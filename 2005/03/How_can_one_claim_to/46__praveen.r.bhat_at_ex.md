Humble praNAm all,

(I read your next posting suggesting that we end this thread, but since I
read this one first, may I safely post the following?) :)

I can see two points in above:
--You do not believe in following jnAna mArga, which I don't have anything
to say about.
--brahmaN is not knowledge to be acquired. Perhaps, comes from the first
assertion or the first comes from this one. May I say I agree
(hypothetically, for what I want to say next) with the way you worded
"brahmaN is not knowledge to be acquired" and then try to twist the
statement and say "but acquiring knowledge (of brahmaN), one acquires
brahmaN"?

By renouncing everything? Maybe, maybe not. Some *masters* renounced, some
didn't. Which one are we to follow? By reading/hearing of them or their
works, right? Aren't we all doing the same?

In jnAna mArga, without refuting the *wrong* (unreal, not real) attributes
of brahmaN, one can't know brahmaN (real) or acquire It or be It.

Neither being a master guarantees moksha nor being a punDita. Who wants to
be either and not brahmaN? :)

jai bajrangabali,
