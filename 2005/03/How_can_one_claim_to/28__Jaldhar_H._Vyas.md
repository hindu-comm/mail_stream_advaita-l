Sorry to be blunt but based on your posts uptil now, I don't think you've
made a thorough study of Advaita Vedanta at all and I think your
perspective will change once you actually do so.

Sure I agree with that.  But there is nothing arrogant about stating the
truth.

Note I didn't say logical (though I do in fact believe it is.)  I said the
means of knowledge (pramanas) are the same.

Of course.

So if the essence of reality cannot be captured in words, why are you
quoting a book at me?  Either those words have meaning in which case your
point is disproved or they do not in which case they do nothing to support
your point.

In fact I (and you etc.) as Brahman did create the world so why from
the perspective of Brahman would I need to do it again?

What I am objecting to is that there is something called "direct experience"
which is sperate from "words and thoughts."  The reader and the listener
have as much of a direct experience as any mystic.

Unfortunately a certain 19th century apologist for Hinduism tried to show
how "modern" our religion was by appealing to the prevailing romantic
agnosticism of the day and this has colored his interpretations
unreasonably.

In fact, immediately after this phrase "neti neti" a positive description
of Brahman _is_ given.  It is satyasAmasatya ("The truth of truth") Neti
neti merely means that it is no this one thing or this other thing.  It in
fact pervades all things.  The way to learn this is not to stop thinking,
but to expand ones thinking to cover greater and greater areas.

No need to scoff,  just to put it in a proper perspective.  In many places
in the shastras you find phalashruti, advertisements if you will, that
laud the subject at hand.  This is why one should look at the whole
system rather than isolated sentences.

Sure why not.  A sheperd girl is of the nature of Brahman just as much as
the greatest Rshi.

It has been my experience that rather than making it easier to understand
it just confuses things further in the minds of people who are only
familiar with translations and not original texts.
