But you quote Ramakrishna and Vivekananda and you haven't learnt at their
feet.  You have only sat in a comfortable study and read about them.
Just like a philosopher.

And another thing, how do you know books about the master lives are
accurate?  There was a notorious case a couple of years back of some
person who wrote a book about Ramakrishna which alleged some pretty
heinous things.  People lie.  How will you know the difference?

Would you recommend to an MBA student that instead of reading accounting
textbooks he study the lives of great accountants lest he doesn't get
close to the real knowledge of accounting?
