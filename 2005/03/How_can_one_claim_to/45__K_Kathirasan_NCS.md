Namaste Maheshji,

If you have the time, try to get hold of the book 'Introduction to Vedanta' by Swami Dayananda Saraswati. Although it may seem like an Introductory book, it is not. It handles all the subtleties of Advaita Vedanta in a clear manner. 

There is a lot of Truth in what Jaldharji is trying to convey. Try your best to get hold of this book.

Pranams:

All your points are well taken and I would agree to most of them. But the purpose of my mail was different. In my opinion, Brahman is not knowledge to be acquired (like we would do physics or chemistry) but knowledge to be lived. As Jaldhar has oft pointed out that we are all Brahman but have forgotten it, I can only say that we can remember this original state only when we live like the Master's did and not by understanding their subtle theories about why Brahman is Advaitic only or Vishistha Advaitic or Dwaitic! That makes you a pundit and not a Master!

Regards, Mahesh
