I fully agree with the above. But, my only point in the question was
that when a realized soul claims "Brahman is Sat-chit-ananda", he or
she is identifying Brahman as an object (different from him or
herself) and with attributes so how is this possible when in the
Brahman state (or Samadhi) there cannot be a difference between the
knower (the person) and the known (Brahman).

Regards, Mahesh
