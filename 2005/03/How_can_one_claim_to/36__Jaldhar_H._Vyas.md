Sorry for the late reply, I was travelling.

Novice, master, philosopher, ji (I am younger than you and hope it will be
many years before I become a ji!) these are not useful labels.  What is
useful is the distinction between those who love truth and those who think
there is no such thing.  The first will eventually prevail even though it
may take a while.  The latter will remain in stagnation forever.  Novices
are welcome here.  Perhaps we could do more for them but we certainly
don't despise them.  But to those who willfully and proudly choose to
remain ignorant we should offer nothing but contempt.  For their cynicism
affects more than one Internet mailing list.  In another post you talk
about the sorrowful condition of Indian culture and point to Mahesh Bhatt
as an example.  Mahesh Bhatt is a clown.  Nobody outside his narrow circle
of fellow narcissists should give him the time of day.  I can criticize
him like this because I have an objective standard to do so.  But if there
is no truth only opinions, then why shouldn't his opinion be considered as
good as Swami Jayendra's?

I see from another post that you have started reading Panchadashi.  That's
an encouraging sign and I hope you stick to it.  Feel free to ask
questions here if you have any.
