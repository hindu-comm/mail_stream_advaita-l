I would advise you to spend more time on the primary texts and teachers of
Advaita Vedanta as somewhere along the line you have been seriously misled
as to its methods and goals.

What is Samadhi?  It is defined as the state of balance of the three gunas
that occurs when the turmoil of the mind has ceased.  For Samkhya/Yoga
that is tantamount to liberation becuase it is a dualistic system.  An
eternal, inert, merely witnessing Purush is "stuck in the mud" of an
eternal, chaotic, completely dynamic Prakrti.  Samadhi is the seperation
of the two.

But in Advaita Vedanta both the Atma and the three gunas are of the nature
of Brahman though they are under the erroneous notion that they are
seperate entities.  How would Samadhi, even Nirvikalpa Samadhi,  help
remove that false notion?  It couldn't.  Only knowledge could.  At best,
Nirvikalpa Samadhi provides a stable platform from which Jnana can be
pursued without distraction but it only represents a status quo.

The opposite of intellect isn't mysticism, it's stupidity. Again please
read the works of Shankaracharya or Swami Vidyaranya or Swami Madhusudan
Saraswati etc. to see how they use "mere" intellect to reach the highest
goal.
