praNAm all,

Forgive my jumping into the context...

May I humbly object to this statement? Its vague to say that *only* his
ideas are well established. If I say that I'm unable to capture the essence
as written by Shankara, is it not my understanding that is at fault, in the
same way that no matter how much ever a *master* teaches, there's no
guarantee that I'll understand? I'll try to relate something that I read in
Swami Venkatesananda's book... he says that when someone talks/writes
(source/guru), its *conveying*, but one can *communicate* only when the
other (disciple) raises himself to the level of the source.

How could it have been the *whole* purpose of his life? It may have been
*one* of the purposes, since we do have his works for our aid!

Perhaps... but only based on one's own limitations! In a similar argument,
no master can probably take all to liberation, else all disciples of known
masters would have been liberated (and its a good guess that they're not).
