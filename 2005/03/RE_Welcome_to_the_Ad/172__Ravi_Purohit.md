Namo Narayan, jai shree krishna
my name is ravi shashikant purohit. i am 18 years of age, and live in the 
heart of belgrave in leicester UK. i am a student of the sciences, and 
numeracy. i hope to attain a career in healthcare. more importantly, i am a 
diciple of a retired shankarcharya, and wish to broaden my knowlegde on 
advait vedanta. my parents are devout bhagats, but i, from a young age 
wanted more than to worship. when i was given guru diksha i did not know 
what my guru stood for due to mere geographical limitaions, but started 
researching the upainishads and the gita. Advita immediatley stood out, and 
made sence to me. maybe it was because my guru had influenced me without me 
knowing. in his recent visit to the uk, i found the courage to talk to him, 
and learnt alot more. i am part of hindu youth uk leicester, from which i 
was introduced to this forum. i hope to be accepted, and to attain vast 
knowledge in this feild.
