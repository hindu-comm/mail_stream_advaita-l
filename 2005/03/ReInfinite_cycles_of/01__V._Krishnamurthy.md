Namaste Raghavendra-ji and all

You write:
 "vedAnta in general proposes that the cycles of creation
and destruction are infinte in the past as well as future.
If this is true, then infinite number of years (or
any other units of time) must have passed before the
present state of the world. But how can
*infinite* number of years ever pass? Does any one have a
solution for this?" 

The answer is simple. There was no starting point of time.
Your question arises only when you assume that it all
started one fine morning. No. For every cycle of creation
there was a previous cycle -- believe it or not!

PraNAms to all seekers of truth.
