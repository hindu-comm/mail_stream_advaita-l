Synopsis:  The one refuge of all the universe is the single
foundational principle of The Self. That is what lightens
up everything.   It is subtler than Space. Anything other
than the Self is a mithyA.  It cannot be grasped by the
senses. A  mind full of tapas is necessary.  Only by
surrendering everything that is non-Self, can that nectar
be tasted. Ishopanishad may be recalled.

Synopsis: The One Eternal unmoving that pervades everything
 shines as a colossus  (brahma-vRRikShah) when the mind
itself ceases to be the mind. The non-dual oneness of
brahman  is then seen to have swallowed this universe.
This colossal tree is seen by the same puruSha in the
buddhi, as distinct from the  universe. It has its roots
upward, like the reflection of the tree in the bank seen in
the river.  This reflection is not real. The samsAra-tree
has to be cut asunder. The Atman however can neither be cut
nor destroyed. The bhAva that does this is the conviction
 I am not this body or the senses. The colossus of the
brahma-tree is the tree of Aum by which the whole is
sustained. The tree of the non-Self is just the tree of the
mind. It is the mind that has to be cut asunder. By
thinking of sense-objects this will never happen. It is the
mind that has to be controlled by reason and  by shruti.
Recall the vedic passage: Brahman is the forest; Brahman
is the Tree. The colossal stands unique.   It tantamounts
to saying that The Self alone is there and nothing else. As
the mahopanishad says, it is the mind that creates the
delusion of water-in-mirage. The creation of the mind by
its own ignorance has to be negated. The mind itself is a
projected entity from the Self. By the universality and
indivisibility of the Self, the created mind along with its
own creations have all to be sublated.
