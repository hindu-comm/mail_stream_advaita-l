We are back to the vexing problem of which are genuine upanishads and
which are later forgeries.

the seven lokas from bhu, bhuva, svah (swarga), maha, jana, tapa, to satya.

Only the first six are lokas. satyaloka is Brahman so the correspondence
is maintained.

I will try and look up the excat references for you but Brahmana,
Upanishadic and puranic texts do mention the equivalance of seven vyahrtis
with seven lokas

Probably this is not to be taken literally but these are various systems
of upasana with a common goal which is to progressively expand the
consiousness of the conventional man until he identifies himself with
Brahman.  The Brahmasutras do say that although the vidyas mentioned in
the jnanakanda have different forms, they have a unitary purpose.

I'm afraid not and neither has Shankaracharya or any other ancient
commentator mentioned the subject.  This could be because:

1.  These "upanishads" are not genuine.

2.  They are genuine but Shankaracharya was not familiar with them

3.  They are genuine and Shankaracharya was familiar with them but did
    not think them relevant to Vedanta.

4.  They are genuine and Shankaracharya was familiar with them but he
    thought they contained secret doctrines not to be revealed in
    "public" works.

Or possibly other reasons.  We don't have enough information to make
anything more than a guess.  Tantra is a wide-ranging phenomenon and some
varieties are consonant with Vedic thought like Shrividya and even have
their origin in the Vedas while other types are nastika and totally
against Vedic norms.

You should try and find out what someone like e.g. Shri Bhaskararaya who
was a master Vaidika as well as a master shrividya upasaka has to say
about this.

This requires further research.  I shall try and respond soon.
