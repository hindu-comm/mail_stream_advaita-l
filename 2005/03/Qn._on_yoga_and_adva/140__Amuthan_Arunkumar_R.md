namo nArAyaNAya 

dear list members,

recently, i have been coming across many sources (both
in this list and outside) that yoga was later modified
to fit into advaita. the main contention is that
nirvikalpa samAdhi alone does not lead to moksha...and
in some places it is treated on par with deep sleep;
in that there is no citta vr.tti during nirvakalpa
samAdhi and in deep sleep. 

i'd be extremely thankful if some of the list members
who are well versed in advaita vedanta can clarify
this issue by clearly showing the relation between
yoga and advaita, i.e. the similarities and
differences. to sum it up, is nirvikalpa samAdhi a
necessary condition for the attainment of moksha?

please provide references where this subject is dealt
with in detail.
