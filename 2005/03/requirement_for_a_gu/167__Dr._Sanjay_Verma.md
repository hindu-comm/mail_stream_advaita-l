Namaste and Pranam,

The two quotes below in my original email are about 3-4 paragraphs apart. In the first quote, I'm not sure what your objection is (you responded: "Not necessarily"). I merely stated that it's explicitly stated in Advaitic works I have read. I have not indicated in any way that such a notion (ie, requirement of a guru) does or does not exist in other traditions.

In response to the second quote you asked for the book's information; this was in reference to a book which deals with the direct path approach (ie, no need for a guru). "The Direct Path" is by Andrew Harvey.

Om Shanti,
Sanjay

Namaste. Not necessarily. One can also find the same tradition like dvaita, vishitadvaita etc

Please do so. Thanks
