Dear Sri.Ravi,

Your idea sounds great, all the very best for the initiative.  

I do have a suggestion though.  Generally the regular postings and contents of the group seem to be of very high standard, which is praise worthy, perhaps the aim of the group.  In other words, it serves as a platform for those who already know the esoterics, to exchange their views.  How about considering novices like me, who has the interest to learn, is teachable, has the desire and craving to learn whatever little is possible.  In my opinion it would be appropriate that the learned members do an initial introductory posting(s) outlining the basics so it will help many silent members in the group to participate and benefit.  In case this point is already on the agenda, please accept my thanks.

Best Regards
Swaminathan

Let us know your thoughts (and amendments) on the following proposal. 
Discussion on this matter will be closed on March 31st. So please send 
your comments to the list. And restrict yourself only to ONE post on 
this subject. Final decision will be made by the moderators based on 
your input.



SUMMARY: Coming chandramAna year, pArthiva, will be devoted *only* to 
the discussion of Sankara's bhagavad gItA bhAShya.

Key Items:

A) No other subject, except ADMIN posts will be allowed.

B) All subject lines should refer to a chapter and/or verse from gItA.

C) Main focus will be on our AchArya's bhAShyam. But notes from other 
associated sub commentaries and other commentaries to explain the text 
are welcome.

We started Advaita-L in 1996 and till this point, we have not undertaken 
a systematic or a focused discussion on this very important work. I 
hope we can remedy this in the coming year(s).


Ravi Mayavaram
