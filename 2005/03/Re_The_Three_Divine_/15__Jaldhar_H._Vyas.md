The Shatapathabrahmana observes that the Gods love mysteries and riddles
because they are afraid that the jnani will steal their positions.  The
Devatas have reached their positions and "immortality" through their good
deeds in previous lives but it is relative.  When the merit of these good
deeds is exhausted, they will have to return to samsara.  But jnana is the
true immortality.  So these are roadblocks placed in our paths to impede
our progress.
