His magical deeds and miraculous achievements make people
think He has great attachment. But He is unattached.   So
says Shri Shuka, in the context of who is asking and who is
listening.

loka-saMgrahaNArthaM ca shAstraM vakti yathA tathA .
shoka-moha-karI mAyA yathA naShTA bhavedapi .. 88 ..

For the benefit of the worldly the shAstras say, mAyA is
the promoter of sorrow and delusion, it has to be
discarded.

The great soul Rama (himself)   is reminded by Lakshmana
and others: How is it You dont recognise yourself as the
Atman, the great?

Such Vedantic passages and events are everywhere. All
confirm the Gita statement: I am equanimous with respect
to all beings.

Arjunas delusion was also overcome, by his own admission.
Shedding off the I-am-the-body attitude, he was able to act
in the glory of the Self.

The lighting up of Bliss through the Learning from the
Ocean of Immortality is like the Sun lighting up through 
the top of the   tree in the sky.

Just as the Sun is inferred through the foliage one should,
through the exercise of the intellect, infer the Self
through the foliage of adjuncts wherever they are.
__________________________________________________________________________

tathA ca cidghanAkAshaH madhye madhye ca dRRishyayoH .
mAdhuryAdirasAssarve gRRihyante jihvayA yathA .. 94 ..

Among whatever is seen, now and then we realise the
presence of the Fullness of Consciousness  just as, the
tongue now and then tastes the sweetness of all that is
sweet. 
_____________________________________________________________________________

tathA manAmsi pakvAni gRRihNantyeva rasAmRRitaM .
manasA vedyate vedyaM vedyaM manasi tiShTati .. 95 ..

That is how the mind registers and absorbs all that is of
the essence. It is by mind that one should know what is to
be known. And then that gets imprinted in the mind.
___________________________________________________________________________
yanmanovedyahInaM ca gRRihNAtyeva navaM navaM .

The mind keeps on absorbing newer and newer things that
need not be known. But what is to be known is not to be
absorbed this way.
_______________________________________________________________________________

etadarthaM ca manasaH bahiShkAryAshca vAsanAH .. 97 .. 

That space in the mind should be filled with the immortal
essence obtained by yoga. For this purpose all external
vAsanAs are to be discarded.

Synopsis: In Shiva temples we usually stand behind the
Nandi and see the shiva-lingam in the distant garbhagrham
(sanctum sanctorum) through the horns of the bull. Hara
oM is the mantra. Full of the Consciousness that we are,
we should accept that between the horns of the bull there
is only the pervasion of the same Consciousness and the
same Light lights up the distant shiva-lingam also. It is
this kind of thought that should permeate us always, so
that we should exhale (rechaka) the thoughts that are
raised by our vAsanAs and fill the mind with the the nectar
of thoughts that are generated by the Gita.
