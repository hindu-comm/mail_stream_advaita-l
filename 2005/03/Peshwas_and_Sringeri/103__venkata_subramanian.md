Am not aware of any Peshwas attacking the Sringeri Math.  There was at least one "Bhairava" who was i believe, a Kannadiga only, (Kalasa sect or some thing of that sort) who literally ruined the Math and texts books about Sringeri describe that he even damaged the Sri Sharada Vigraha (for its and Deve's gold ornaments).  This happened during the Pontificial Reign of Jagadguru Sri Sachidananda Bharathi Swamigal, the 25th Pontiff of that Math.   Krishnaswami Iyer has written a tamil work on the life of this swamigal based an an old palmscript manuscript of the Math's History.  




Later everything was restored.

I don't know about Shrngeri, but the Mahrattas did sack other temples.
Until recently all over the world, the principal method of financing an
army was looting and plunder. The generals may not have considered holy
places to be the ideal targets but given that for the typical jawan the
idea that Tulaja of his native village, Sharada of Shringeri, and Devi of
the Puranas are aspects of one and the same Divinity was a remote and
abstract theological concept, they may have decided that "business is
business" and looked the other way.
