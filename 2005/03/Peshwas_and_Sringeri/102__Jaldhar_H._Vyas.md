I don't know about Shrngeri, but the Mahrattas did sack other temples.
Until recently all over the world, the principal method of financing an
army was looting and plunder.  The generals may not have considered holy
places to be the ideal targets but given that for the typical jawan the
idea that Tulaja of his native village, Sharada of Shringeri, and Devi of
the Puranas are aspects of one and the same Divinity was a remote and
abstract theological concept, they may have decided that "business is
business" and looked the other way.
