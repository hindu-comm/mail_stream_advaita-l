Namaste

If the list does take up Gita Bhasya for discussions, here is a web resource that the list members will find useful, especially those who may not have the books.

The Gita Supersite has probably been mentioned in this list before:

http://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/

Looks like the site has been enhanced recently to include several noted Advaitic commentaries such as those by Sri Madhusudana Saraswati , 
Shri Neelkanth, Shri Dhanpati etc. These are only available in Sanskrit but Sankara's commentary is also available in english.

The site has audio of the Gita verses and also a rudimentary search facility to search for the occurence of any word. The Gita text (mool slokas) itself can be viewed in several different languages.

Just an FYI for interested folks..

regards

Sundar Rajan
