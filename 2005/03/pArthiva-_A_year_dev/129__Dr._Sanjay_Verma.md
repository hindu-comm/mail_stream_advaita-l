Namaste and Pranam

A dedicated period of exclusive discussion of the BGB will probably be most rewarding for many members of this list. However, some concerns have been voiced regarding the duration of such an exclusive discussion and the impact on other discussions and personal research that may also prove to be valuable Perhaps the moderators will consider an initial period, of say 3 months, dedicated to exclusive discussion on BGB, with the purpose of developing some focus, depth, and momentum. After such time, other discussions could also run parallel to the BGB discussion. 

My experience after almost 3 years on this list is that when a topic has sufficiently captivated the attention of the members it sustains momentum on its own untl interest exhausts itself.

Om Shanti,
Sanjay

Namaste

If the list does take up Gita Bhasya for discussions, here is a web resource that the list members will find useful, especially those who may not have the books.

The Gita Supersite has probably been mentioned in this list before:

http://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/

Looks like the site has been enhanced recently to include several noted Advaitic commentaries such as those by Sri Madhusudana Saraswati , 
Shri Neelkanth, Shri Dhanpati etc. These are only available in Sanskrit but Sankara's commentary is also available in english.

The site has audio of the Gita verses and also a rudimentary search facility to search for the occurence of any word. The Gita text (mool slokas) itself can be viewed in several different languages.

Just an FYI for interested folks..

regards

Sundar Rajan
