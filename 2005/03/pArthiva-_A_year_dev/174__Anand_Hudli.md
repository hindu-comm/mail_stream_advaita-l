This is an excellent idea. However, restricting discussions to the gItA 
alone may be a little too restrictive in my opinion. The gItA can be *the* 
main topic, while other topics can be discussed as long as they do not 
occupy "center stage." This can be arranged by restricting the number of 
messages on other topics to a low number per day or week.
