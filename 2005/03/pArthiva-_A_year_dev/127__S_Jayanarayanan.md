I don't think the proposition as it stands is a good idea for
the following reasons:

1) It seems to be sending the message that:

"If you are interested in starting a thread on the Brahma sUtra
bhAshhya or wish to participate in discussions on the
upanishhads, this list cannot accommodate you."

It sounds rather restrictive in "forcing" people to study only
the GItA bhAshhya, even though they may be genuinely interested
in other equally important texts. The primary purpose of the
list to hold discussions on all texts pertaining to advaita
VedAnta seems lost.

2) I'm now doing a series on pUrva mImAmsA (hard to believe with
the lack of posts in recent days, but it is true), and would
have to either complete it in the next few days, or cut it
prematurely. I'm trying my best to get it going, but it's more
difficult to find time while being employed than being a
student.

3) Upto now, this list discusses not only the texts of advaita
VedAnta, but certain philosophical questions such as "What is
avidyA?" or "Why is the dream state equated to the waking
state?" or "What does Shankara say regarding sannyAsa?" etc.
Such discussions help a lot in understanding what the basics of
advaita VedAnta are, and this will no longer be possible with
the proposed rules.

4) Occassionally, doubts creep in regarding texts that one has
read before, and these questions can never be asked.


Why not have the series on the BG BhAshhya while other
discussions go on uninterrupted? There is no reason why a series
cannot go on in parallel with other discussions.

If a focus on the GItA is indeed preferred, why not try
something like this:

1) Threads on BG must have "Gita Bhashya" on the subject line.
So people who are specifically interested in such discussions
can concentrate on these posts.

2) Each person will be permitted not more than 1 post/day for
discussions other than the BG. (All but one post per person will
have to be connected with the BG.)

There needs to be some leeway in discussions. Limiting the
discussions only to the BG is rather restrictive and quite
unnecessary.
