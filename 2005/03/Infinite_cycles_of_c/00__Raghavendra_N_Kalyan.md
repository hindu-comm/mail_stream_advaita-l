Namaste,

I have a question. vedAnta in general proposes that the cycles of creation and destruction are infinte in the past as well as future. If this is true, then infinite number of years (or any other units of time) must have passed before the present state of the world. But how can *infinite* number of years ever pass? Does any one have a solution for this? Thanks.
