Sorry I'm still catching up with the last weeks messages.

What opponents often fail to grasp is that Advaita Vedanta posits a
twofold view of reality.

Vyavaharic: Brahman is satya, Jagat is mithya
Paramarthic: Brahman is satya, _there_is_nothing_else_

Because the cognition of the world never did start or stop.  The
perception of time is also Maya.

There is a category error here.  When I say I know e.g. programming, that
knowledge has an object (viz. programming)  But we are not saying Brahman
knows creation, we are saying it is pure knowledge.  So there is no primal
avidya which can be a property of Brahman, only individual cases of
superimposition and veiling (avarana-vikshepa.)  Thus Brahman _is_ pure.
Perhaps Maya is just lila, the inevitable byproduct of existence.  A
Vaishnava ought to be able to appreciate that. But recognizing that is
only possible from within Maya.  Thus from a logical point of view avidya
is neither existent nor non-existent.  anirvachaniya (logically
undefined.)  This is one of the axioms Aditya was talking about and I
suppose you have to take it on faith.
