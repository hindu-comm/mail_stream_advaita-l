if Adi Sankaracharya's philosophy was flawless then why can't it
describe how the cognition of this world started, one of the answers given
by myself was that it is because of ignorance, but then the question is, if
Brahman is pure and all knowing then how can ignorance even come into the
equation. If Paramatma is pure then how can this world (or creation) be a
part of ignorance, as only ignorance can arise from not knowing, saying
this
if Paramatma was all knowing ignorance would have no leg to stand on, or if
ignorance is the cause then Brahma is flawed.

bhagavadpAda deals with this objection in gIta bhAshya (13th chapter??) &
in  *AtmEti tUpa gacchanti grAhayanticha*....sUtra bhAshya.  & it is also
important to distinguish between two different view points in advaita i.e.
loukika (transactional) drushti & pAramArthika/shAstra (transcedental)
drushti.  If we have already realized that we are secondless brahman then
there is no avidya, it is only jIva bhAva which is wrongly identifying
itself with corporeal plane rising this objection.  So, for the question to
whom does this avidya/ignorance pertain?? the answer is avidya pertains to
the person who is asking this question...

Sri Jaldhar prabhuji will clarify this point in an elaborated way....just
few thoughts from my side.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
