Namasthe, 
I thank you for your welcome letter requesting me to furnish my bio data.

Company in India.
I was born and brought up in India with Indian culture and tradition

attempted in the last 15 years to study Adi Sankara Bhashya of Ten
Principal Upanishads,Bhavad Gita and Brahma Suthra.Besides I have also
covered Sanath Sujathiam,Vishnu Sahasranama and Trisati Bhashyam of
Sri Adi Sankara.I have completed HH Chandrasekarendra Bharati's
commentary for  Vivekachoodamani

I live in the above residence and I have dedicated another flat in the
same street for Indological Studies where Vedanthic Classes are
conducted daily by Scholors which are digitally recorded and
circulated among interested persons.

I am also attempting to bringing out monographs on Advaitha Vedantha
Literature particularly to younger generation sothat they can
appreciate Indian values.One such publication is on Brahma Suthra
Sankara Bhashya Sangraha with selected portions of Bhashyam with
English translation duly divided into various topics for people to
understand particularly Westerners.I am creating a web page with a pdf
file containing the full version of the publication and   will shortly
forward to you be shared with other Vedantha students.
