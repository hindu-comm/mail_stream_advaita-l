The idea that there are different "yogas" is a peculiar invention of
Vivekananda.  It has no basis in Advaita Vedanta.

The message of the Vedas is twofold, karma (action) and jnana
(knowledge.) Of these, the former as practised by a karmayogi results
in the purification of mind and body.  But as there is still
identification with a mind and  body, it cannot liberate.  it is only the
jnana marga as practiced by a sannyasi which leads to the knowledge that
liberates one from samsara.

Bhakti can belong to karma or jnana.  As karma it is faith that following
dharma is pleasing to Bhagavan.  Impelled by the thought "how can I serve
Bhagavan the best?," the bhakta proceeds to ask "Who is Bhagavan?" And
eventually he realizes "Bhagavan pervades all this and my very self" Thus
Jnana is the highest form of bhakti.

Rajayoga is just a form of bodily and mental discipline which, again, can
be applied to either karma or jnana.

Brahman _is_ jnana.

I think Kundalini, chakras etc. are one means visualising the process of
sadhana.  There are other processes of upasana described in the shastras
too.

I don't see why not.  Samadhi is just an intermediate stage albeit a
superior one to the confusion of the everyday world.
