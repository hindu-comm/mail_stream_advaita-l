Again, "when one achieves self-realization", it may well be as you say. But
then, thats only for the realized; for others, logic, shruti, debate, etc
would *still* be the means and one cannot discount their usefulness. Pls
correct me if a jnAni said otherwise.

Maybe, maybe not. For, if a jnAni keeps silence, who will teach us mortals,
unless we ourselves are capable to learn from His silence?

Agreed. The only problem, if I may call it that, arises when we *mix* paths!
*Following* was an understated fact on my part.
