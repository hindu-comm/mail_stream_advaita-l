The scope of this list is Advaita Vedanta and most people on the list
appear to be scholars on the Vedas, philosophy and abstruse points of
logic or Jnanis in short. But, what is behind this Jnana? What allows
Jnana to happen in the first place? Isn't it divine love? Or in other
words Brahman? Without this source, Jnana is like a computer - awe
inspiring in its power and a source of great wonder but unable to do a
simple thing as make a child smile...and that is when one gets a
glimpse of what Atman really is.

In my opinion, intense Jnana can take you very far indeed. But, on
this path, at the point when "everything falls into place" or one
achieves Self Realization, it requires a huge leap of
intution...logic, shrutis and debates would appear to be quite limited
in their usefullness after this. Silence would be a more appropriate
expression of this truth.

Which brings me to the above point - who can claim to follow only one
path on this arduous journey of self discovery? It seem nigh
impossible. Sri Sankara singing "Bhaja Govindam" shows Bhakti, in the
same song one of the verses talks of regulation of breath (Raja yoga),
his setting up Maths for the welfare of people shows intense karma
done with a desire to serve and that he was a Jnani is impossible to
overlook. So, to reach this goal, one needs to follow all the paths to
some degree to make the journey more easier.

With love and regards, Mahesh
