Thasyahap prakruti leenasya ya paramsa maheswarah

Meaning:
Not By Work, not by Progeny, not by Wealth, they have attained immortality. Some have attained immortality by renunciation. That which the hermits attain is laid beyond the heaven. Yet it shines brilliantly in the (purified) heart.
Having attained the immortality consisting of identity with the supreme, all those aspirants who strive for self-control, who have rigorously arrived at the conclusion taught by the Vedanta through direct knowledge and who have attained purity of mind through the practice of discipline of Yoga and steadfastness in the knowledge of Brahman preceded by renunciation, get themselves released into the region of Brahman at the dissolution of their final body.
In the citadel of the body there is the small sinless and pure lotus of the heart which is the residence of the Supreme. Further in the interior of this small area there is the sorrow less Ether. This is to be meditated upon continually.
He is the supreme Lord who transcends the syllable Om which is uttered at the commencement of the recital of Vedas, which is well established in the Upanishads and which is dissolved in the primal cause during contemplation.
