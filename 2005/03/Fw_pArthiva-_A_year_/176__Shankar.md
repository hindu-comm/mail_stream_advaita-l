Namaste,

It is a good Idea, Novices like me can aquire more knowledge . I have got
some suggestions, hope
moderators treat it as worthy.

Can we concentrate more on the chapters which
helps people as a guide to lead a life as per the
principles of GITA while he is deeply involved in
his chosen ocupation....... whatever it might be.

Also, as some suggested , it would be helpful
if the thread takes a break in between to discuss
on other texts of adviata which is read and still
to be understood by persons like me.
