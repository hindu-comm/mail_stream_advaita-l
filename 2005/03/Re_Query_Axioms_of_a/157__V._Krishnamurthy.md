Namaste, Aditya Vartun Chadha-ji
You  write:
"I want to know whether it is possible to "prove" the above
statements
somehow. If so, then what are the atomic truths that are
used in such
a "proof"? If such a proof is not possible (that is to say
that these
statements are simply assumed true), then can all other
manifestations
of truth be arrived at by the application of these
statements? "

 May I recommend you to a chapter on 'The Proof' that I
have written some time back .  You can access it through:

http://www.geocities.com/profvk/proof1.html

and its succeeding  18 pages. 

Incidentally, I am not replying to your long response
(m16281) to my reply to your other query; because, your
last paragraph there summarises my own view. Thanks.

PraNAms to all seekers of Truth
