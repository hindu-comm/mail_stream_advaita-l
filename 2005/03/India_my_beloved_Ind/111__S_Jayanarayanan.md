I'm aware that this topic is not related to advaita and need not
be discussed on this list, but I did not see the list moderators
step in to stop the thread, hence my first and final posting on
this thread.

What kind of TV programs are you watching?! :-)

I hold a contrary viewpoint. There is nothing wrong with wealth
-- if obtained and used morally. Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth,
is worshipped in the temples throughout India. Kubera, the lord
of wealth, is considered a highly auspicious deity. It is
undoubtedly a good thing for India to slowly rid herself of
poverty and be able to feed her citizens.

What is bad, however, is attachment to wealth and its use for
adharmic purposes. This is a problem of the individual and not
of the times, for there were staunch materialists even during
the times of Adi Shankara. The Mahabharata has many characters
who were arguably more materialistic than those living today.

If you want to be spiritual, simply shun materialism yourself
(start with the TV!). There is no need to blame the times.
