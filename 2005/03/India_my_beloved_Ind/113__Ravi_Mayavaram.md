Karthik,

I agree with you, one of us should have acted fast and
stopped the thread. It was clearly out of scope.   I have requested 
Mahesh to stop this thread.

Rather than posing it for a nation, a similar topic, on how one can 
protect onself from  materialistic attachement and the onslaught of 
sensuality in the media is within the scope. That will fall under the 
category of sAdhana and krishna gives some good tips in gItA. And your 
reply, that the reform should begin at the personal level is quite apt.


Thank you.

With best regards,

Ravi
