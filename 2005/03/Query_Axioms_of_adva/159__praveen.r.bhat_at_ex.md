AFAIK, isn't Shruti considered as *the* valid pramANa and a set of axioms,
if you will? What I'm trying to say is that any mechanism of analysis of
subject under consideration, if proven by a Shruti vAkya, stands proven. Of
course, there may be supporting arguments of logic that even if Shruti says
fire is cold, one shouldn't agree, but I do not know of anyone rejecting the
Shruti vAkya with such logic! Your starting points, too, have Shruti vAkya-s
as basis. Well, you know all this;  you want to, perhaps, minimalize this
Shruti *set* itself, but I wonder whether it is *truly* possible to do it,
since it may be an ever growing list!

Forgive me too for my reply is equally dry :)
