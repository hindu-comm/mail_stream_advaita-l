Pranams:

At a restaurant in town, DDW is busy absorbed in a book. 

TD: Hello, there I didn't expect to meet you till tomorrow.
DDW: Maybe, it was God's will! :-)
TD: What are you reading?
DDW: Someone gave me a copy of "I am That" by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj
today. By odd coincidence, I happened to chance on the following
conversation which brings out quite nicely what you mentioned about
"action in inaction" in a Jnani. Let me read this snippet:
"Maharaj (M): Neither action, nor feeling, nor thought expresses
reality. There is no such thing as an expression of reality. You are
introducing a duality where there is none. Only reality is, there is
nothing else. The three states of waking, dreaming and sleeping are
not in me and I am not in them. When I die, the world will say - 'Oh,
Maharaj is dead', but to me these words have no meaning...
Questioner (Q): Why live at all? Why all this unnecessary coming and
going, waking and sleeping, eating and digesting?
M: Nothing is done by me, everything just happens. I do not expect, I
do not plan, I just watch events happening, knowing them to be unreal.
Q: Were you always like this from the first moment of enlightenment?
M: The 3 states rotate as usual - there is waking and sleeping and
waking again, but they do not happen to me. They just happen. To me
nothing ever happens. There is something changeless, motionless,
immovable, rock-like, unassailable, a solid mass of pure
being-consciousness-bliss. I am never out of it. Nothing can take me
out of it, no torture, no calamity."
TD: Wow! A real Jnani!
DDW: True, he met his Guru at age 34 and realized by age 37. But, I
was thinking of our conversation as usual and it strikes me that the
thread is taking interesting turns. We talked of free will and divine
will but prayer seems to be a good bridge between them. Though not
really paying much attention to God all their life, most people resort
to prayer in difficult times. It appears to be God's way of making
people remember Him or Her. It would be interesting to hear you views
on "unanswered prayers" but I guess we must bring DFW in this
conversation or else, we miss an important point of viewâ€¦..

Regards, Mahesh
