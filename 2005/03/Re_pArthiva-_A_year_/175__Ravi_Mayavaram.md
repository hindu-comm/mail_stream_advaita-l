Thanks for all your suggestions. I will discuss this with other 
moderators and we will consider your valuable suggestions carefully then 
post the guidelines for pArthiva samvatsara. If you have anything more 
to say, please send that as a private e-mail to the moderators.

Since majority  of our regular contributors don't want to shut out other 
posts,  we will have a reasonable scope  for other postings. One of the 
restrictions may be placing a limit on the number of other postings. I 
also think having text based discussions will improve the quality of the 
postings.

Vidyasankar suggested to in a private discussion  that if we have poll, 
many of the silent members may step in and vote. Hence, I have created 
one, even if you have written before on this topic I request you to vote.

I don't know if there is way to close the poll here (that was the first 
google hit I got), but I will consider April 3rd as the closing date for 
the poll.
