Thanks for your email on the meanings of mantras, I will be
coming to that in my next posting on the series on pUrva
mImAmsA. I have a couple of questions regarding what you wrote:

The book I have, "The Purva Mimamsa Sutras of Jaimini, chapter
I-III", by G. Jha, does say that "chatvAri shR^inga" refers to
the four horns or quarters of the day, and "trayo asya pAda"
refers to the three feet or seasons of the year, and therefore
the mantra refers to the sun. However, there is no mention of
this mantra referring to agni. Is there another source you have
consulted for this?

The book by Jha says on KumArila's commentary to pUrva mImAmsA
sUtra 1.2.44 that reciting mantras does lead to a transcendental
result. Is there a difference of opinion between KumArila and
KR^ishhNa yajvan on this point - as to whether or not recital of
mantras leads to a transcendental result?
