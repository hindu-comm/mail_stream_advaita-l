There is a work called the pUrva mImAmsA darshanaM published by the 
erstwhile royal Government of Mysore. This includes the bhATTa-dIpikA of 
khaNDadeva and the sUtra-vR^itti of kastUri-rangAchArya.  Herein it is 
stated:

yadyapi-iyamR^ik.h bhAShyakAreNa yAgastuti-paratayA vyAkhyAtA, tathApi 
vArtikakR^itA viShuvat-saMjnakaikAhe "AgneyyAM hotA shAMsati " iti 
viniyogAnusAreNa- AdityarUpeNa- agnisstUyate ityuktam.h|

Even though, this R^ik has been described as a praise of yajna by the 
bhAShyakAra (shabara), yet the vArtikakAra (kumArila) has said that it 
praises agni in the form of the Sun, since it is used in the viShuvat homa, 
the homa has agni as its deity, and the mantra is recited by the hotA (the 
R^ig vedic priest).

I will try to address the question regarding the adR^iShTa result of a 
mantra later.
