Yes, if you want to call it motivated karma, for a non-jnAni. For a jnAni,
there is only prarabdha karma; tripurA rahasya actually categorizes the
realized also and about those of the highest order, it is said that there is
no prarabdha karma also (this latter thing is a commentator's
interpretation) ! But one may argue about why others see as a jnAni acting
if there's no prarabdha.

Precisely the point. Thats the reason I said we fall under the category of
TD, who sometimes call it divine will and at other times, think of free
will. IMHO, "cover for inaction" may be true in some cases, but not in all.
