Pranams:

Though Prof V K Krishnamurthy has invited scholars to continue the
conversation and I am sure, they would, without doubt, be able to
quote specific scriptures to validate any points they make, I would
fall short on that front. However, though I may not be able to quote
specific scriptures at this stage, I have been immersed in the
thoughts of various Gurus (Sri Ramakrishna being the primary one) and
so do have a taste of the essentials of the scriptures and so I take
the liberty to continue for a while...

--------Mahesh's addendum 12-Mar-05---
DDW: I am sorry but I have never come across the term "individualized
PrakRti" before. PrakRti sounds quite akin to the Samkhya/Yoga
philosophy but I have not heard of it associated with SvabhAva. As per
my understanding when you are born your SvabAva is governed by your
past Samskaras. These can be looked on as subtle impressions stored in
your soul which tilt your nature in a particular way. This serves to
explain why in a single family, one sibling could are drawn to
spirituality but the other scoffs at it. So, prArabdha-karma and your
past Samskaras together define where you are born, your parents, etc.
so that you can be in a position to exhaust the karma in the way your
SvabAva tends to be.
DFW: Ok, so let us get back to 'choice of action'. As per what you
say, you aren't born with a clean slate and your nature to some degree
is already formulated. And as per what TD said, fate too is somewhat
defined due to prArabdha-karma. But going ahead, are you free to act
as you will?
DDW: A Swami at the Ramakrishna Math who I happened to talk with on
this subject said that the ego is given to a human so as to give him
or her the impression that he or she is the actor. It allows humans to
discuss things like 'Satyam vada'  and 'Dharmam cara'.
TD: Maybe you can tell us what you mean by Ego which might explain who
the doer actually is.
DDW: Hmm….as per Samkhya, ego or Ahamkara is a product of PrakRtis as
she evolves after coming in contact with Purusha at the time of
creation. It is a mixture of the constituents of PrakRti - the three
gunas (Satva, Rajas and Tamas).
TD: So, is PrakRti the doer then? 
DDW: She could well be as she has the power to act and is considered
to be the dynamic aspect of Brahman by some.
DFW: Hang on, coming back to the same point - can she act with an
independent will unbeknownst of Brahman?
DDW: That is impossible! Brahman by it's very nature is the substratum
of all that exists and is knowledge absolute so there is nothing
outside its domain.
DFW: Well, we are back to square one, aren't we? It is ultimately
Brahman (or God) as PrakRti that does everything!
DDW: I have been pondering this question for a while since we last met
and the only way I can explain the apparent mess in the world created
by an all perfect, all loving Brahman is using a story I read sometime
back in this connection: A child was sitting at her mother's feet, who
herself was seated on a chair doing some crochet work. Being a young
child not knowing what crochet work was, on seeing the mess of loose
threads of all colors in disarray from the bottom, she happened to
remark. "What a messy thing you have created"? The mother only smiled
and gently lifted her child on her lap and showed her the beautiful
design on the upper side of her crochet work. The child's eyes shone
as she saw the beautiful creation and she cried - "This is so
wonderful!". So, the unrealized soul is like the child seeing the
world (crochet) with worldly or ignorant eyes and the realized soul is
the child who has got the mother's (or God's) grace and is able to see
the world through God's eyes. And as far is free will is considered,
in my opinion, even while a trace of ego exists in us so that we are
yet not aware of God's will, it would be best to use the Shrutis or
Smritis to guide our actions. Otherwise, we would be lying saying that
what we have done what has been ordained by God because all the time
we really had no awareness of the Almighty in our actions.
DFW: Well, the free will answer seems like a good working solution but
doesn't really solve the problem. Because I could do something against
the scriptures and though I know I am lying, the action is done and as
per your thinking it has to have been done by God! So, you cannot
technically hold me accountable for it!
DDW: I may not but by God's will there will be others like you who
believe in free will and think the action is wrong (possibly by the
law of the land) and punish you for it! Beyond this I cannot say more.
TD, I think maybe you settle this in a more convining manner since I
am out of more ideas for now...

Regards, Mahesh
