I hope the following extracts on above Shloka justify "action in inaction"

from Shankara's commentary, translated by swami GambhirAnandA:
"...he who sees action because of egoism being implicit in the idea, 'I am
happily seated quietly, without doing anything'..."

from aBhinavaguptA's commentary, translated by Dr. S. Sankaranarayan:
"he who recognises the non-actions [of his] i.e., the actions performed by
others, as actions being performed by himself (or who recognises the
non-actions undertaken by others as being undertaken by himself), because of
his intrinsic nature of the fully risen state"
