This is an amazing book. You can read more about it at

http://www.escribe.com/religion/ambaa/m5950.html and
http://www.escribe.com/religion/ambaa/m5971.html

If you know Tamil and are a devotee of ambA, then you should have this 
book.

BTW, the old Tamil translation of Sri bhAskararAya's bhAShya by Sri 
Ganesha Iyer, is also back in print now. My friend recently bought a 
copy from Giri Trading in Madras.
