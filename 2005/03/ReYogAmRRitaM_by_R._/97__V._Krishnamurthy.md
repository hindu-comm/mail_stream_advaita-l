Namaste.

Namaste Sunderji, wonderful. I am sure you are going to be
of great help to me in my translation of my father's work.
Yes, ShATyAyani upanishad contains exactly the 2nd line of
shloka 10 of the text we are reading. So now  "yathA
ShATyAyanI shiraH' would mean 'according to ShATyAyanI 
Upanishad'. The word 'shirah' means 'head', denoting the
head of the vedas, that is, upanishad. In fact all
upanishads are referred to as 'veda-shiras'. Now the full
translation of shloka 10 is to be revised as follows,
(thanks to Sunder-ji!):

The Lord is to be propitiated by yoga. As per the words of
ShATyAyanI upanishad, the yajna of yoga is nothing but
service done to the Guru and the Almighty with one-pointed
devotion.

PraNAms to all advaitins on this list and to my father
