A jnani amongst Devatas is in the same position as a jnani jivanmukta
amongst humans.  A Devata has reached his exalted position due to many
good deeds in previous lives.  He must go through the effects of this
karma just like a jivanmukta has to go through the results of his
prarabdha karma.

But he _is_ present everywhere at all times.  It is only to the ignorant
Nachiketa (and us) that it appears there is an entitity called Yama who is
teaching about Brahman.  Were we to ask Lord Yama, he would not agree that
he is "localized in his abode"
