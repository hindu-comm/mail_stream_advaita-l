Though it is not advisable to teach meditation practice in absentia, I can
give you a few tips which will help you in the physical/mental aspects of
meditation, if you so wish.

Same as above.

I can try to help you in the matter if you want.

Our scriptures saying "Heart is on the right side in the body" has a hidden
and not direct meaning.
"Right side of the body" means the surface consciousness, the consciousness
which is operative in the waking state (and in dream state). "Heart" is the
"space" (aakaa"sa) of our thoughts. Whatever thoughts arise in our mind forms
a kind of "thought-space", that is "Heart" (skt. h.rdaya). If you try to
detect it in the right side of physical body, of course it will not be found!
If you ask me why the "right side" then it requires some more detailed
explanation.

Your letters were very interesting and arresting. Go slow, be patient. The
Reality is accessible as Shri Ramana has tried to explain. Best wishes,
