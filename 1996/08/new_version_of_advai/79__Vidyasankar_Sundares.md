I viewed the trial version using netscape 3.0 and Internet Explorer. IE
could not handle the macron accent at all. Netscape did everything nicely.
I don't think Lynx can handle any of these accents although they are all
part of the ASCII character tables.

As of now, I don't think anybody likes the trial version. I'll keep it on
for a week or so, and see how it goes. I would be most happy not to change
the existing transliteration. I would be avoiding some extra work that
way! Meanwhile, responses are welcome.
