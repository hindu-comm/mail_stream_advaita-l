Vidya - since you asked

Frankly it turned me off.  I liked your previous version.  I thought I am
now got used to reading one transliteration RIT or TRANS and somthing in
between to which your old one belonged.

by the by I tried to get to the old version to compare the two,  but your
server did not let me in.

Hari Om!
