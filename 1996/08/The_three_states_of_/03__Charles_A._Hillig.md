There's no "one" really "there" to realize anything
          because there's no "one" really "there" who is either "asleep" OR
"awake."

In other words, there's not a so-called  "problem-with-the-mind."

The ONLY so-called "problem" is believing that there IS a "problem."

But, of course, for WHOM is this a "problem," anyway?

(Then, again, who's asking??)

Hello,

I was just wondering if there were two different words:

maya and mAya
Sivananda and SivAnanda
Acarya and AcArya
stotras and stOtras
jivatma and jeevAtma

If not, then is it acceptable to everyone to not capitalize letters in
the middle of words?   I presume that the point of the capitalization
has to do with pronunciation, but I am not speaking the words, I am
reading them and it is a LOT harder to read with the capitalization in
the middle of words.

I can understand the capitalization in an ENTIRELY Sanskrit text, but
IMHO, it is awkward and unnecessary when occasional Sanskrit words
occur in an English sentence.


Thanks,

Ken                       <*>

Can you provide me with a scriptural reference (or a statement of
Shankara or Ramana Maharshi) that says that Saguna Brahman is a
creation of maya?

My understanding is that Brahman is not created, whether Nirguna or
Saguna, and that this is the special characteristic of "personal God",
that it is the appearance of Brahman within maya.

But if authorities say otherwise, I'd be interested to read it.

My understanding here is that there is creation, but it is illusory.
To use the famous example, if one sees a snake, but upon
investigation, one discovers only a coil of rope, the appearance of
the snake did exist  - as an appearance, but not as a reality.

In this latter point, I think the difference may just be semantics.


Namaskar,
