Self enquiry is not the only way to realize the Self it is one way for
some who are addicted to intellectualizing and even this has to be given
up before the jewel is won.
When you are doing your self enquiry meditation each day , don't be upset
if thoughts intrude just keep going back to the question "who am I".
eventually you will feel a joy inside along with the feeling "I am!"
when you get this feeling even faintly, hold on to it. When the thoughts
come try to feel that joyous "I am!" in the background then gently
bring yourself back to this feeling only. Even the question "Who am I" will
then dissolve.

It seems that you are answering your own questions and since none of
the "learned members of the Group" have answered - - ;( There are really
no Advaitins or Advaitists, as by definition these are they who "believe"
in nonduality. Being an Advaitin or a member of a group cancels their
nonduality.)

As for people with "mental disorders",
We need not worry about these people because we know *all are one*.
There are not two.
The best thing you can do for them right now is to realize your
own true nature then the light will spread even to them.

We are all *knowing, being and joyously reveling* in our own true nature!

Actually, I wanted to know about the "original books", i.e, written by
Shankara himself, in his own handwriting. Are these preserved somewhere?
For that matter, is any material object at all concerning Shankara's life
preserved?

How were his biographies written? Vidyaranya located Shankara's birth place as
Kaladi. Did he locate it by his yogic powers? Is this accepted by modern
scholars?

Moreover, Shankara's mother tongue must have been Tamil, since Malayalam
evolved as a distinct language sometime later. Why did he not compose any poems
or write any books in Tamil? Did he acknowledge the authority of Tamil
scriptures like ThirukkuraL or was he at least aware of their existence?

About scriptures like the Mahabharata: were the shlokas written on palm
leaves? It must have been quite a difficult task for someone to copy it down
- without mistakes - from another existing manuscript!

In one biography of Buddha that I read, Buddha is said to have listened to
discourses on Atman and Brahman by a reputed scholar and then disagreed with
that philosophical view.

Speaking of abhedabheda, does Shankara clearly distinguish between Vyavaharika
and Paramarthika Satya or is that a later development in advaita? I read an
article on Bhaskara and found that his philosophy was close to the "advaita"
that I know, which deals with "two realities". In fact, introducing two truths
as Vyavahara and Paramartha seems closer to abhedabheda, which emphasizes both
difference and non-difference, while advaita places emphasis only on
non-difference.
