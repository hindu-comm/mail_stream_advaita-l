I am not saying they are in samadhi.

May be I am wrong but my feeling is: The average human mind perceives the
world, imagines it to be real and is in the wrong path. Only selected few
who have control of the mind direct it inward for Self-exploration,
realize that the world is a product of maya. Once it is realized, mind
quietens down, does not fluctuate and the person becomes jnani. Removal
of this veil of maya is enlightenment. This enlightenment is only for
people with what we call a "normally functioning mind".

Now let us take the case of a person with what we call a "mental
disorder". We need also to keep in mind that it is we (who have a
"properly functioning mind" which perceives the world as real (!))
that put the tag of "mental disorder". This person has not perceived
the world at all and hence the concept of real or unreal world does
not arise. So, the proper word is not enlightenment for this person.
But I believe this person is closer to God, because maya is ineffective
in deluding this person.

History of Hastamalaka (one of Sri Sankara's disciples and the originator
of Hastamalaka Stotra)is to be kept in mind in this context. There is
no Sankara now to wake this type of person.
