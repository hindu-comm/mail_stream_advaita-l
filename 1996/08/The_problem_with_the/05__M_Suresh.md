  I am not a learned member of the group, but here is my opinion :-). The
 control
  of senses should be voluntary and not due to something external. Thus
  deep sleep or unconsciousness does not qualify as control of senses. Deadening
  of one or more local senses by local anesthesia or being born without one of
 the
  senses would also not amount to mind control of which the senses are agents.

  Just as the senses are instruments of the mind. The brain is also a sort of
  instrument of the mind. So being born with a defective brain or deadening or
  activating certain regions of the brain by drugs, alcohol, electrical
 simulation
  etc. will not amount to samadhi.

regards,
Suresh.
