OM NAMO NARAYANAYA

NAMASTE!

AdiShankara in Bajagovindam states "ARDHAM ANARDHAM"

Markandeya Mahamuni wrote in Saptasati "DEHI SAUBHAGYAM AROGYAM DEHI DEVI
PARAMAM SUKHAM"

I dont know what to make out of these two statements from two enlightened
persons.

Can anybody explain?

                                           shubham
