How can a person with a malfunctioning mind realize?

May be I am wrong, but my views are the following: In my view, realization
is a concept developed for a properly functioning mind alone.
Discrimination between what is real and what is unreal is enlightenment.
For that discrimination to occur, one has to perceive both real and
unreal things. Then only discrimation arises. What, if the person
does not perceive anything unreal ? Unreal things are perceived only
when a person is under the influence of maya. Maya acts on the mind,
superimposes and masks the reality and projects unreality. If a
person is not under the influence of maya, unreal things are not
perceived.

I brought in the case of Hastamalaka as an example for the point I am
trying to make. I admit, it may not be the proper example. But
(according to writings), Hastamalaka, before Sri Sankara met him
is not different from any person with a "mental disorder" now.

I think it is trivializing an important discussion.

Let us take two persons, one a worldly person and the other a person with
"mental disorder" (Sri Sadananda uses the word "madman" or "unmatta" for
this person). Let us hypothesize that ultimate Reality approaches these
two persons in the form of a psychologist. The ultimate Reality shows a
red ball and asks what it is. The worldly person answers it a red ball
and the "unmatta" either gives an incoherent (to us) answer or would not
respond. The ultimate Reality next shows a green car and asks what it is.
The worldly person answers it as a green car and the "unmatta" either
gives an incoherent (to us) answer or would not respond.

I wonder who is the "unmatta" or the person with a mental disorder here?

I think there there is danger in judging everyone by the standards set
by us, the worldly persons. I sometimes feel that we give too much
credit and importance to ourselves (arrogate may be a strong word, but
not by much) to think our standards are right.

How do we know that in God's view, we are not labelled unmattas ?

I do not dispute that. But we cannot judge that someone else whom we
tagged as a madman is not a soul with knowledge of ultimate Reality.
