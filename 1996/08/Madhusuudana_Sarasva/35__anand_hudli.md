sahetukasya saMsaarasyaatyantoparamaatmakaM |
paraM niHshreyasaM giitaashaastrasyoktaM prayojanaM || 2 ||

Word for word meaning:

sahetukasya - that which is with the cause(s)
saMsaarasya - of the empirical existence
atyanta - absolute or complete
uparamaatmakam - that whose nature is cessation
paraM - the greatest
niHshreyasaM -  good ( as a noun)
giitaashaastrasya - of the Giitaa scripture
uktam - was said
prayojanaM - the objective

Translation:

  The objective of the Giitaa scripture is said to be the supreme
  good (mokshha) which is characterized by the absolute cessation of
  empirical existence together with its cause.

 Notes:

 1) Madhusuudana has used here some of the words that Shankara
    does in his introduction. For example, we read in Shankara's
    Giitaa bhaashhya :

     ... asya giitaashaastrasya saMkshhepataH prayojanaM paraM
         niHshreyasaM sahetukasya saMsaarasya-atyantoparamalakshhaNaM|

     Briefly, the purpose of the Giitaa shaastra is to set forth the
     highest good which is defined as the complete cessation of
     saMsaara and its cause.

2) Anandagiri, in his gloss on Shankara's Bhaashhya, says that
   the word sahetukasya is added to indicate that samsaara or the
   transmigratory life  along with its causes such as delusion
   are also eliminated, when niHshreyasa is attained.
