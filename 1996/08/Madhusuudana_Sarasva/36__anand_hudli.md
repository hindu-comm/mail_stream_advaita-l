       Translation:

 The (study of ) the three portions of the Vedas is undertaken for the
 attainment of the highest state of VishhNu which is existence,
 consciousness, and Bliss,  is infinite, and is Brahman (tat).

  Notes:

 1) The word puurNaM, literally complete, means the infinite according
    to Shankara's commentary on the puurNamadaH mantra of the
    bR^ihadaaraNyaka upanishhad:

     AUM puurNamadaH puurNamidaM puurNaatpuurNamudachyate |
         puurNasya puurNamaadaaya puurNamevaavashishhyate ||

         That (Brahman) is infinite. This (universe) is infinite.
         This infinite emanates from that infinite. Taking the infinity
         of the infinite, what remains is infinite only.

  2) The word "tat", that, indicates the Supreme Brahman of the
     upanishhads.

  3) Shankara gives some excellent definitions of the word VishhNu
    in his commentary on the VishhNu sahasra naama.
    One such definition is:

     veveshhTi vyaapnotiiti vishhNuH

     One who pervades is VishhNu.

     vishhervyaaptyabhidhaayino nukpratyayaantasya ruupaM |

     It is the combination of vishh, meaning to pervade, with the
     suffix nu.

    deshakaalavastuparichchhedashuunya ityarthaH |

   (VishhNu) means One who is devoid of the limitations of
   (belonging to) a specific place, time or object.

   "antarbahishcha tatsarvaM vyaapya naaraayaNaH sthitaH "

   naaraayaNa pervades the whole (world) inside and outside,
   ie. everywhere. (mahaanaaraayaNa upanishhad, naaraayaNa suukta)


 4) The VishhNu suukta of the Rg Veda, which is appended at the
   end of the Purushha suukta recitation by Rg Vedins, contains
   the expression "vishhNoH paramaM padaM".
