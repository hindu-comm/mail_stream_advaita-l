    advaita is, first of all, the science of the upanishhads according
    to Shankara himself. There are, I am sure, people like Ramana
    Maharshi who have realized the Self by their relentless practice
   of Self-inquiry. But even in those cases, it may be argued that such
   people had studied the upanishhads in a previous life. What happened
   in their most recent life was the culmination of this study.
   So there is no way that we can avoid studying Vedanta.

   Here, I take it, the "map" is the scriptures, such as the
   upanishhads. When one listens or studies these texts and reflects
   on their true meaning, that person has already begun the journey
   to Self-realization. The process of studying, reflection, and
   meditation on the meaning of the texts is repeated hoping that
   at some time it will result in the direct realization of the Self.

  This is a good point.  Personally I would say that I have changed my
  life a great deal by studying some texts. The benefit that I have
  derived from the Giitaa, the upanishhads and other texts is
  hard to express in words. I have understood myself more than I would
  have without studying those sriptures.

  But I do agree that we should not be too preoccupied with scriptures.
  A balance must be maintained between discussion of personal
  experiences, discussions of jiivanmuktas and discussions of
  advaitic treatises. Unfortunately, we do not have much information
  on the lives of jiivanmuktas (liberated while living) except,
  of course, those of people like Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta
  Maharaj, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa,  and HH Chandrasekhara Bharati of
  Sringeri. From others, all we have is some of their writings. So
  that brings us back to the discussion of advaitic treatises.
