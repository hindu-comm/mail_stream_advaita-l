Yes, the "map" is not the Self. *Who* is looking at the map?

In daily life ask, *Who* is doing this work? *Who* is walking down the street?
*Who* is sleeping, eating etc,?
This way the body is seen as the illusion it is. It is not the same body for
even a full second of time, since at least millions of changes in its appearance
happen in that time. This way the *Real* shines through and life is seen as
a-mazing, phenomenal and joyous no matter what the body is going through.

Are you trying to say that nonintellectual people cannot realize their
own *True Nature*? Of course not.
Next to the light of the *Self* all the writings of Sankara aren't even
one candlepower in the midday sun. So even though Sankara has helped
to remove layers of ignorance he must be abandoned with all other
appearing phenomena once the jewel has been found. :>
