  I would like to point out that Sri. Ramana Maharishi realized the self
  through practice alone. The only scholarly aid he got was the word
  Arunachala he heard from one of his relatives.

  However he studied the
  texts of Shankara AFTER realization. So I do not agree that the works
  of great people are only to be studied in the initial stages and to
  be abandoned later. Both scholarship and practice have their parts to
  play in the removal of ignorance which makes us forget the ever present
  self.
