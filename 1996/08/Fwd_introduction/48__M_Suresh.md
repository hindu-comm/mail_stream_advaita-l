  Since we are beyond the mind, I think we can control the mind. Of course the
  thought of controlling the mind is a mental thought, but its source is
  from the self, sat-chit-ananda. But it looks like controlling of the mind is
  the same as the mind subsiding on its own.

  I would like to add that though sattva guna is the most preferred, Tamas is
  the only guna among the three from which one would like to get out or
 transcend
  it. One is hardly aware of the presence of the other two gunas, and so becomes
  unknowingly bound by them.

I'd like to offer my thoughts on this. While study of books etc can be
dismissed very easily it should be remembered that not every one can sit and
meditate 15 hours every day. Studying philosophy would also help in
concentration. It is the study without proper attention to developing
meditation, which is condemned, not study per se. If Ramana had condemned
studying itself, why did he translate so many books into Tamil for his
devotees? In fact when some one remarked that it was good that he hadn't
studied, since they would've got a scholar and not a jnaani, he remarked that
his studies were probably completed in his previous births. Further many of
Ramana's foremost disciples were scholars of great repute. It is also a well
known fact that Ramana used to lecture for hours on end on the finer points of
Tamil Grammar in the poems by Shaivite saints. People are usually unaware of
these things and think that Ramana condemned study per se.

So pointing to the example of Ramana and asking people to "imitate" him is quite
incorrect, IMO. The best thing would be to study without any desire for fame.
When time comes the studying will cease by itself.
