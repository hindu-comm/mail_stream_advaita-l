        Maharshi said that  "...the mind is only a bundle of thoughts and
that the thoughts arise because there is the thinker.  The thinker is the
ego.  The ego is the root-thought from which all other thoughts arise."

     If we are only a "point of view," then perhaps Chuang Tzu was correct
when he said:

     "Joy, anger, grief, delight, worry, regret, modesty, insolence.....let
them be.
     Without them, you would not exist.
     Without you, they would have nothing to take hold of."
