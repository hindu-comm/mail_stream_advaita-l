These are my personal views and I do not have any scriptural references.
Hence, I may be wrong.

Mind is a product of maaya. Sattva, Rajo, and Thamas are properties of
maaya. Thus, if we give too much importance to the mind, we become deluded
by maaya and cannot see beyond it.

I see the usefulness of the mind: in that it allows us to discriminate
[between Real and unreal].

But, on the negative side, mind is also the one which receives maaya in
all its fury. Maaya has the fundamental property that it obscures the
Reality and projects what is not real. The mind is the one that receives
the maaya-projected world.

It is true, in very very select few, mind goes beyond this and
differentiates between what is Real and what is unreal. But in the
majority of humans, the mind simply perceives the maaya-kalpita world
and the human simply gets submerged in this unreality.

Mind, put to proper use (I mean, by proper use, the discrimination
between Reality and unreality) is very useful. Looking at the world
and the humans in the world, how many people do we see putting the mind
to proper use ?

I would argue, on the whole, that average human mind is a liability.
Simply put, maaya acts through the mind to delude us.

In the context of my above comments, control of the mind is very
important. Who controls the mind ? The "I", the Atman has to control the
mind. In the ultimate Reality, the Nirguna Brahman is a silent witness in
the struggle between the Atman, "the consciousness" and the "mind" (the
product of maaya). the victor determines "punarapi maranam, punarapi
jananam"
