        Can there exist a mind without a body.  In fact the mind is nothing
but a bunch of thoughts that arise due to identification with the body.
        It is nothing but a bunch of thoughts arising from time to time with

Your right is to work only, but never to the fruit thereof. Nor let your
 attachment for the fruits of your action lead you to inaction.
