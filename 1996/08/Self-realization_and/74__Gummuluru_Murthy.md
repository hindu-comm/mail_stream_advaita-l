As you might have noticed from my earlier posting(s), I fully accept the
interpretation that everything is pre-ordained, and thus I am perfectly
in tune with the quote from Sri Ramana Maharshi which you posted.

But Sri Ramana Maharshi's quote seems to comment on the body only. How
about the mind ? How about the reaction of the mind to any event ? Is
that also not pre-ordained ?

If you do not want to break your own dictum of not posting anymore on this
topic, a private e-mail (for my own clarification) would be appreciated.
