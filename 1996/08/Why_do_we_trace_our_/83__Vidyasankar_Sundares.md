What you say regarding the ego element in describing ancestry is true. At
this stage, one should become a sannyasin. Giving up the connection to
family, gotra and proud ancestry is the ultimate vairAgya. As the jAbAla
upanishad says, "yadahareva virajet, tadahareva pravrajet" - one can
renounce the world the moment one reaches complete vairAgya. The one who
has completely renounced has no family, gotra and varNa-ASrama do not
apply to him. Till such a time, one does maintain that ego element.

That it is consistent with the advaitic thinking is what Sadananda was
pointing out. "yatra tu dvaitamiva bhavati, tatra itaretaram paSyet, ...,
yatra tvasya sarvam AtmaivAbhUt, tatra kena kim paSyet, ....?" Doing
abhivAdanam means that one recognizes another to whom one wants to pay
one's respects, i.e. one is necessarily in the realm of dvaita in order to
do abhivAdanam. In the realm of dvaita, one can talk about advaita at an
intellectual level only. One has to transcend the realm of dvaita to have
the advaita experience.

The vedas and SAstras are addressed to all different levels of aspirants.
Given the fact that one has already identified the Atman with the body,
they prescribe gotra, r.shis etc. as part of abhivAdanam. Till such
time as the AtmA-anAtmA viveka does not arise, one conforms to these
teachings. There is nothing contradictory about it.
