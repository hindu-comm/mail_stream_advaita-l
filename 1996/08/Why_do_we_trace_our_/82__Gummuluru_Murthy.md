          I get the feeling, reading through Sri Sadananda's response to my
          posting, that my original posting gave the impression (to Sri
          Sadananda) that it is the ego of the individual that prompts the
          question "Why do we trace our lineage in chanting Gayatri mantra
          ?".

          Exactly the reverse is what I have in mind.  That tracing of our
          origin and saying it is Gummuluru Murthy, coming from the
          ancestry of such and such great rishiis, has an ego element in it.
          That is the point I am trying to get clarification about.  If my
          original posting gave the impression which Sri Sadananda reads
          into it, my sincere regrets.

          We do prostrate to father and mother, to learned people, to gurus,
          to rishiis ..... There is no difficulty with that and, in fact, we
 enjoy
          that.  My  question simply is  " To say that it is such and such
          individual, coming as part of such and such a (great) lineage, doing
          abhivaadanam has an ego element to it. Why do we say we are part
          of such a great lineage ? And identify ourselves as such and such an
          individual going by the name which the worldly customs give us ?
          Is that consistent with the Advaitic thinking ?"
