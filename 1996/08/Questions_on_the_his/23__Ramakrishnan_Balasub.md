The muktika upanishhad.h itself is not held as supreme, for eg by dvaitins. The
paramopanishhad which proclaims bheda etc is not mentioned in it. Obviously the
muktika was either written by a non-dvaitin or was written before the parama
upanishhad.h was written (probably by Madhva).

The point I have always felt is that none of the other systems proceed from an
analysis of the three states, but rest content on trying to interpret shruti.
The analysis of the three states is clearly supported by the maanDuukya and
also to a lesser extent by other upanishads like the kaivalya etc. So unless
the other systems can provide an analysis of all the three states, they cannot
argue with advaita.

Not very surprising! However, the comparative analysis of the various
interpretations will no doubt be coloured by the views of the interpreter :-).

Ramakrishnan.
