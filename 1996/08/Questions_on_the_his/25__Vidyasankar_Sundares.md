I guess if a judgment were to be made about which school represents the
first 27 Karikas most faithfully, the interpreter's own view will
influence it. But it is not impossible to just do a comparative study of
Sankara's commentary and Madhva's commentary to see where they differ and
where they agree. This does not seem to have been done by anybody. If you
or I were to do it, we might be accused of being prejudiced towards the
advaita view, but if someone from outside any Vedanta tradition were to
do a purely textual comparison, it may be possible for the biases to be
ironed out.
