            I agree that, in dreamless sleep, all conflict and polarities
disappear.   There's no separate experiencer who is "having" an experience.

             But, if your very ground of being is Pure Consciousness,
(because that's ALL that there really is), then joy, peace, love and
perfect happiness are always fully present. The  so-called "differences"
between the states are completely  illusory and only continue to perpetuate
the intellectual separations that the ego creates through the belief that
"something is missing."

              The SELF is always fully present in ITS totality 100% of the
time.  (I mean, where ELSE could IT possibly be?)



 There are several gurus and swamis well known in this world say

        That's right.  There's absolutely nothing to say and no one really
"there" to say it to, anyway.
        The rest is Silence.
