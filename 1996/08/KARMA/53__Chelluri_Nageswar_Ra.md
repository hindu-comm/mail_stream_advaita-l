OM NAMO NARAYANA!
NAMASTE!

I heard from lerned men:

AVASYAM ANUBHOKYAVYAM KRUTAM KARMA SHUBHA ASHUBHAM
(One has to go thru the fruits of one's actions Good OR Bad)

The same people said:

BUDDHI KARMANUSARINI ( Intellect must follow karma)

If these staments are correct where is the room for refinement?

May be some one can make it clear for me.
