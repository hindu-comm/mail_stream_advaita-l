While I do not question the Sanskrit sayings that are quoted here, it
would be nice to see the full verse and from where it is taken so that
we know the context of the saying as well. A statement from the
Upanishads can be brief and makes full meaning even if taken out of
context. I think the others need to be amplified before they are taken
at face value.

 It is the interpretation that differs.

 I like to take the following approach.

 This can be looked at in the worldly frame of reference at four
 levels.

 1. At a complete ajnani level (where man and his actions are
    considered supreme): The riches that one acquires and the poverty
    that one faces are entirely the results of one's own actions.  This
    applies not only to the material goods but also to the so-called
    sorrows and joys.  At this level, there is no God, the individual
    creates his/her own world and the joys and sorrows.

 2. As perceived by a person who recognizes there is something
    beyond our control which dictates things: There is recognition of
    God, and fear of God. This person propitiates Gods so that good
    things are accrued to him/her. This person, at the same time, thinks
    there is free-will of the human. In order to improve what he/she
    thinks is his/her lot in the world, this person thinks (emphasis on
    think) that he/she is acting on free-will, but at the same time seeks
    God's support to alleviate him/her from the miseries of the world.

3.  This person leaves everything to God. Accepts everything as
    pre-ordained, including the actions to be taken by him/her;
    recognizes there is no free-will of the human; even that is God's
    grace; acts his/her role through life.

 4. This person recognizes the whole world is mithya, that we are
    the same as Paramatma. The worldly matters do not touch this
    person. It does not matter to this person whether the world
    recognizes this person as a sanyasi or a samsari, a failure or a
    success or a jivanmukta or by whatever name. This person has a
    quiet mind, in nirvikalpa state.
    In that frame, karma does not have any meaning.


 Even the persistent effors of man (thirukkuraL statement above), or
 the man's ability to chart his own destiny (attributed to H.H.
 Chandrasekhara Bharathi Swamy above): Are they also not pre-
 ordained ?  Surely, what sort of a destiny can man chart of his own
 free-will, even if there is free-will ?
