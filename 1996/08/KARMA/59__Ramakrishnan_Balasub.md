I never disagreed with this. But I was merely saying present actions can be
used to alter what is to happen in the future. This is quite consistent with
the above statement. After all what you do now is prarabdha in the future.

Real freedom, IMO is spoken of here, viz realization.

Ramana Maharishi has also agreed that present actions can alter future events.
Also the idea that homams etc are to turn the mind inwards (as posited by
someone else) is quite unacceptable. Homams etc are for _specific_ purposes. I
hope our Rishis were not unscrupulous enough to make statements which are
false. Similarly Ramana Maharishi himself has accepted the efficacy of
tarpaNam, shraddham etc as beneficial to the ancestors. How do you explain that?

If you are really interested I may be able to dig it up. The yoga vashistha is
also quite clear on this. In the spirit of the last sentence I too will refrain
from posting on this any longer. :-)

Once again I will reiterate that IMO, this concept of "thalai vidhi", "thaliyil
eZuthiyirukku" (written on the forehead etc) is the basic cause our country is
in such a pathetic state now.

Ramakrishnan.
