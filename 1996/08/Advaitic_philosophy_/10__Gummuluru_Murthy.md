My concept is: Saguna Brahman is Nirguna Brahman + the various upadhis
added on due to maya. Nirguna Brahman is the substratum, that changeless
formless entity. Saguna Brahman has a shape which the human mind gives to
the Nirguna Brahman and also gives the power of creation, destruction etc.
The essence of vedanta is negation of any attempt to ascribe property of
Nirguna Brahman. I did not see the concept of Saguna Brahman in Sri
Sankara's prakarana grandhas. Astavakra Gita talks of the creator, Eswara
[verse 9.2] but does not give a shape or form to it. That verse is similar
to concepts developed in Bhagavad Gita.

Exactly my point too.  As long as our thought process is confined to
matters related to the illusory world and our explanation is in terms of
illusory concepts, we are still in ajnana.  But then human mind cannot
comprehend that shapeless, formless (Neti, Neti) entity, the Nirguna
Brahman.
