Aren't Saguna Brahman and Nirguna Brahman non-different? Isn't the very essence
of advaita the negation of any difference whatsoever?

Discussing about creation is supposedly due to avidya. Such talk mostly results
in random guesses, IMHO. It's probably to discourage such discussions that
Buddha refused to present a thesis of his own.

The concept of Saguna Brahman was probably introduced into advaita after
Shankara.

Is there really such a clear difference between Saguna Brahman and Nirguna
Brahman in advaita?
