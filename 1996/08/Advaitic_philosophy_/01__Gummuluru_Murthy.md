I do not have any scriptural reference. Scriptures (vedas/upanishats) have
not stated these concepts in a categorical sense. They are open to
interpretation and works by Sri Sankara and Sri Ramanuja etc add more
definiteness to the sayings of the scriptures. I think the concept of
Saguna Brahman is foreign to (at least early) Advaitic philosophy.
Anand Hudli and Sankar Jayanarayanan explained this better in their
responses to the same thread. I think we should look for a reference
to the concept of Saguna Brahman itself (when it first appeared) in
Advaitic philosophy rather than where it is stated that it is a
perception due to maya.

Modern textbooks on Advaitic philosophy treat Saguna Brahman as a
perception of the human mind [e.g. Advaitic Vedanta by M.K.V. Iyer;
Brahman, a comparative study of the philosophies of Sankara and
Ramanuja by G. Sundara Ramaiah; Man in search of immortality by
Nikhilanda].

I think the concept (Saguna Brahman is a perception by the human mind
due to maya) is consistent.  The only reality is Nirguna Brahman, that
formless entity.  Saguna Brahman is Nirguna Brahman + the various
upadhis added on due to maya. Hence Saguna Brahman is a perception due to
maya.  Take away the upadhis, Saguna Brahman and Nirguna Brahman are
one and the same.

Yes, I think it is a question of semantics.  If it is illusory, my view
is, it does not exist.  In the snake/rope example, snake does not exist,
except in the mind.
