 Here is the first verse of Madhusuudana Sarasvatii's introduction
 to his commentary on the Giitaa called the GuuDhaartha diipikaa.
 I have given the word for word meaning along with the translation. I am
 no Sanskrit Pandit, although I have had the privilege of studying Sanskrit
 under some fine teachers back in India. Fortunately, almost all
 philosophical literature in Sanskrit, and advaitic literature in
 in particular, is not as difficult to follow as, say, the
 kaavya literature  which is replete with similes and other
 colorful ideas that poets make use of. Just compare the Sanskrit of
 the Giitaa with any work of Kalidaasa to see the difference.
 This, of course, does not mean that advaitic works are a translator's
 delight, because the translator has to understand the philosophical
 terms and be able to provide English equivalents. This latter task
 is very difficult, but again, fortunately there is some standard
 established by earlier philosopher-translators who had a good knowledge
 of the English language. The English equivalents may not be the intended
 meaning of the Sanskrit terms but at least they provide a starting
 point to understand the intended meaning. Finally, I would like to
 hear of any mistakes or inconsistencies in the translation.

 In the introduction, Madhusuudana summarizes the teachings in the Giitaa,
 and discusses the motivation for its study. Briefly, he divides
 the Giitaa into three parts, each containing six chapters. The first six
 chapters explain the meaning of "tvaM" in the Vedic sentence
 "tat-tvam-asi", the second six chapters expound the meaning of "tat"
 and the last six chapters establish the identity of "tat" and "tvam".
 The three parts also correspond to the Karma (action), upaasana
 ( worship or meditation), and jnaana (knowledge) portions of the Vedas.

 namaH -  salutation
 paramahaMsa - literally great swan, but here it means a sage of
               the highest order
 aasvaadita - tasted or enjoyed
 charaNakamala - lotus feet
 chinmakaranda - the nectar called Consciousness
 bhaktajanamaanasanivaasaaya - to the One who dwells in the
 hearts (lit. minds) of His devotees
 shriimadraamachandraaya - to Lord Raamachandra

 bhagavatpaadabhaashhyaarthaM - the purport of Shankara Bhagavatpaada's
 commentary on the Giitaa
 aalochya - having reflected on or having studied
 atiprayatnataH - with a great effort
 praayaH - mostly
 pratyakshharaM - every word (lit. letter)
 kurve - I will make
 giitaaguuDhaarthadiipikaaM - (the commentary) which will shed light
 on the inner or secret purport of the Giitaa.

  I offer obeisances to Lord Raamachandra, who dwells in the hearts of
  His devotees, and from whose lotus feet the sages of the highest order
  drink the nectar called Consciousness. Having made a thorough
  study, with great diligence, of Shankara Bhagavatpaada's commentary
  on the Giitaa with its purport, I will write the GuuDhaarthadiipikaa
  which will be a word for word commenatary, for the most part.
  (The name GuuDhaartha- diipikaa indicates that the commentary will
  illumine the secret or inner meaning of the Giitaa.)

 Notes:

 1) The word ParamahaMsa denotes a sage who is a knower of Brahman,
   and sports like a swan in the ocean of Sat-chit-aananda.

 2) Madhusuudana adds "praayaH", for the most part, to indicate that
   he will comment on most parts of the Giitaa, word for word. Some
   parts of the Giitaa, for example the first chapter, do not receive
   a detailed analysis.
