                                            SRI MATRE NAMAH!

NAMASTE!

Brahmacharya (celibacy) seems to be a prerequisite for attaining
selfrealization. For a samsari (family man) it is difficult if not
impossible.  History shows there are only very few samsaris who attained self
realization that too after givingup family and becoming a sanyasi.  Inthe
past there was:
Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa though married led a celibate life.
Sri Raghavendra Swami (Mantralayam) gaveup wife and child and became a
sanyasi
Sri Swami Ramdas, Sri Veera Brahmendra Swami and Sri Anandamayi did the same
as Sri Raghavendra.
At the presnt time there are Mother Meera in Germany and Mata Amritanandamayi
are good examples of Brahmacharinis.
Most of the self realized souls- Ramana Maharishi, Chinmayananda, Sivananda
all are brahmacharis.   There is not even a sigle soul in this world who
attained selfrealization without being CELIBATE.
IF  AM WRONG, SURE APPRECIATE CORRECTION.
