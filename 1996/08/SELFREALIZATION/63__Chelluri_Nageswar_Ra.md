sri matrenamah

sada,  tell me why Swami Chinmayananda, Mata Amritanandamayi, mother meera,
yogananda and scores of thers preferred celibacy and snyasa to married life.
 I understand what you are saying about celibacy bu why these people took
sanyasam.

address this point.   also if you know a samsari in the present or recent
past, would you tell me.   I will go fall on his feet to tell me the means to
achieve the goal.

                                      shubham
                                         nagy
