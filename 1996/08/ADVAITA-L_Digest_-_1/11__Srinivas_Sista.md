I have couple of sincere questions.

1. Is there a need to classify the thinking as correct and incorrect?
   Who is the authority to decide?
2. Is only the concept of karma the direct result of ajnana?
   How about concepts like nirguna brahman, illusory world, etc?
3. What about the concept "karma is a direct result of ajnana"?
   Is that a result of jnana?
   If not at what conceptual level does ajnana end and jnana begin?

regards
Srinivas.
