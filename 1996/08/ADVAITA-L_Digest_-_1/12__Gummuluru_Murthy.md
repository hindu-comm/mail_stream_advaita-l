I do not think I can even attempt to answer these questions. I can only
make a comment.

When I said the concept of karma is a direct result of ajnana, my
thoughts are the following: Anything that changes belongs to the
realm of the illusory world. Thus, Saguna Brahman, time, space
all are imaginations of the mind and change and are not real.
The concept of karma belongs to the realm of the universe and
hence is a creation of the mind. It is good, proper and the only
explanation, but only in the framework of the illusory world.

As long as we try to explain any happening in terms of such concepts,
we are shrouded by ajnana. Jnani recognizes only Nirguna Brahman,
the changeless entity. In that framework, there is no karma, no time,
no space and everything is unchanging.
