It's upto you to decide.

The same again.

shruti explicitly states that jiivamuktas may seem like mad men and behave in
non-standard ways. This is clearly stated in the jaabaala upanishhad and the
examples given are R^ibhu, nidagha, duurvaasa, dattaatreya etc. There are many
stories in the puraaNas about the "non-standard" behavior of these people. In
the yoga vaasishhTha the same idea is conveyed.

I can point out the verse number or transliterate the verses when I have time,
from the jaabaala U, if anyone wants to see it.

Even shruti does not purport to give a fool-proof method of identifying
jnaanis. There is none.

Like Giri, this will be my last posting on this topic.

Ramakrishnan.

Hello,

Do the digests put the messages in order from earliest to latest?

If not, this can account for the problems in keeping track of who said
what, since there is still some confusion....

But,  none of the four people mentioned have anything whatsoever to do
with my inquiry, since I have never met them nor read anything about
them.

I don't see how you are relating the two things.  They are:

(1) I asked if anyone could see any connection between, let's call it
the "style" of Ramana Maharshi's excellent teachings and the, in my
opinion, higher than usual number of his disciples who claim to be
enlightened teachers but aren't.   Then, various people responded with
various statements equivalent to "it doesn't matter because all is
illusion".  I replied that if Ramana were asked where the bathroom is,
he would point it out, rather than replying "it doesn't matter because
all is illusion", and in fact that was a big difference between true
gurus and false teachers.

(2) Above I said that all charlatans say they are enlightened, so
therefore statements by people that they are enlightened are no proof.

Where is the contradiction?

Again, I was not the one who said "all these people suddenly became
enlightened ..." and in fact, have never commented about Ganapati Muni
at all.  I've never commented negatively about any teacher by name in
a message to this mailing list.


Namaskar,
