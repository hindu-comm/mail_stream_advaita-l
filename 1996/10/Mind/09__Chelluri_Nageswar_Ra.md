Sri murthy wrote that this world is big institution driven by maya

If one is of the stature of shankaracharya, yes one can say that this world
is mithya/illusion.     In my opinion one has to have the qualifications and
experience.

I cant stand infront of the world and say (Aham Brahmasmi) until I realize
what it means.
