     It may not really be a matter of  "learning."    Maybe it's, actually,
a matter of  "un-learning."

     There is no quintessential difference between a  so-called "saint" and
a so-called "sinner."
The only apparent "difference" is that the saint KNOWS this, and the sinner,
seemingly, doesn't.

     There is NOTHING to "realize."  And no separate "one" really "there" to
do the "realizing."
