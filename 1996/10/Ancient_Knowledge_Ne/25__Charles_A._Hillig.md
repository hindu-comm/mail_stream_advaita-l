see the message of the old texts in today's terms."

      If nothing has ever been really "apart,"
                                        then what is there that can be
"brought together?"

     And what is all of this about "old texts"  vs.  "new texts"
                      ????????????????????????

     The study of either only gives the so-called ego
                                                          something  to
"cling to"

    (or,  even worse, something to make itself  RIGHT about!!)

     The old or new texts won't "set you free."

     Find out, first,
        WHO thinks
                   that they are
                                 "in bondage"
                          and WHO is this one who, supposedly,  needs this
"release!"

                                 With Blessings,

                                                          Chuck Hillig
