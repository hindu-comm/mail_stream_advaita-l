It *seems* hilarious to even ponder the apparent outrageousness of such a
question, but the answer is...YES!

Bhagavan even said that "for all we know, Hitler was a jnani!" [...]
"...working as an instrument in the hands of God."

Ramakrishna's quote about madmen, drunkards, etc. speaks to this also, in
compelling terms.  (The way of jivanmukthi is unfathomable, and doesn't
necessarily fit in with the relative scheme of things.)

Also: One jnani doesn't necessarily know another.  Not all are automatically
endowed with the siddhi of mental telepathy (or, in this case 'heart
telepathy').

Sadananda made excellent points...quote worthy!

peace.
namaste.
