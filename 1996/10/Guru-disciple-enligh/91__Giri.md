        Then, why don't you, my dear friend produce "their own statement"
or provide proof that they passively accepted others statements about
this. This is the second time i am asking you to produce their own
statement. First you said *all* the four, now you have retracted the
statement against Ganapati Muni but still accuse the rest three. What
makes you think they appeared as Self-realized beings after the death of
Ramana ?
        Though i said that i will refrain posting on this posting, you
continuing to slander these people without proof is shocking to me.
        I also guess eating fish is ok by your standards but not smoking.
