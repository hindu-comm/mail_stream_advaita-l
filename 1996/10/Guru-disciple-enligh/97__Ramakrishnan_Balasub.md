Quite correct. Maharishi never denied there is nothing as free will in the
vyvahaarikaa sense. His point always was that since the reality of action
itself is denied, something like free-will is also denied. Two other related
points may make this clear.

1. When someone asked whether shraaddhas would help the fore-fathers, his reply
was "definitely". So Maharshi never denied the efficacy of karma from the
vyavahaarikaa sense. He similarly held that homams etc could bring about the
desired effects.
2. When people asked if there was really something called kailasa he used to
reply that it's all in the mind. But once someone questioned him specifically
whether Kailasa had an independent existence in the vyavahaaraa sense, i.e.,
America exists if one sees it or not, so does Kailasa exist that way?
Maharishi said that it _has_ an independent existence in a similar sense.

The moral of the story is that Maharishi rarely went into the vyavahaaraa
details unless specifically questioned. He always answered from the "point of
view" of ultimate reality. This has been mis-interpreted by many to mean that
there is no free-will in the vyavahaaraa sense also. Another source of
confusion is that the maharishi sometimes gave different answers to people of
different calibre.

Such mis-interpretations are also denied for eg. in the Yoga VasishhTha and the
Mahaabhaaratam for eg. Vyasa infact says that things are attained by effort
alone and the person who says he cannot attain something due to fate does so
only out of laziness, in the YV.

Similarly Maharishi denied rebirth also. But he has also said that if this
birth is real then there will be rebirths!

I hope I have provided some information and not added to the confusion :-).

Hello,

I'm sorry Ramakrishnan, you still have got the attributions VERY
WRONG!

NO, NO, NO !!

You're not reading the messages and you're not reading the
corrections, either!

The message that I wrote "I agree" did NOT have the names of those 4
in it, not in my portion and not in the portion I quoted either.

Please go back to the digests, so that I do not have to fill up the
mailing list's bandwidth by reposting the exact messages.

Which is why I did NOT say anything about them !

I agree ! Stop slandering me without any evidence !  :-)  :-)

Don't hope - read the digests.

That you still think is the problem.


Namaskar,
