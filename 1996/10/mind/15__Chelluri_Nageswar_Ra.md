                                                  Om Namobhagavati

Namaskarams to you all

Sages and Swamis come out of samadhi leaving the much desired Bliss behind to
help mankind.

When it is established beyoynd doubt that this world is a big illusion, the
question arises in my mind i.e. chelluri's mind whom do these sages and
swamis help?

Regards
                                                                          Rao
