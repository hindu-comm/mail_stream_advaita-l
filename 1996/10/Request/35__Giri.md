Namaste. A site worthy of consideration is an interview with Poonjaji, a
disciple of Ramana Maharshi.

http://www.peg.apc.org/~firehorse/philos/papaji/welcome.html

as far as i know, he lives in Indira Nagar in Lucknow, UP, India.

May i kindly request readers of this list to inform me the location of
the physical body of Ramesh Balsekar, a disciple of Nisargadatta Maharaj.
A friend wants to visit him and would like to know the exact location,
especially if it is in Bombay.

praNaam.
