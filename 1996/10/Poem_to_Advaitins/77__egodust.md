A Sacrifice, from "me" to "you."

************

POEM TO ADVAITINS

Reading, BEING my guru...
Listening to Hendrix's
"Third Stone From the Sun."
Three in One.  Yes!
Oh Absolutely,
Raw Divine Love Resplendent
All directions impossible
To conceive, behold, yet...
RIGHT EVER HERE, NOW!
TATTVAMASI!!!

Oh I LOVE YOU ALL in moments of illusive separation
with full-tilt every ounce of OUR Being!
I touch my head to thine feet, each and every ONE!
Bless and kill-out any whisp of feigned division here!
In fact, there is naught of a *trace* between us here,
there, or anywhere!
No "us."
Period.

ONLY GODBEING.

My [our] guru says only:
"You are That, here and now."
"Nothing more to realize."
