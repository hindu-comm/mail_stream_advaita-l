                                            OM
NAMASTE!

A few weeks ago I posted personal experiences in the realm of unknown.
  After seeing that Sri Srinivas mentioned that he has a couple of articles
describing similar experience and later mailed copies to me (Thanks
Srinivas).
Strangely enough the experiences are more or less similar in nature.  I want
to share a para from one of these articles.

"It came to you sir, uninvited.  You never sought it.  As long as you are
seeking it, you will never have it.  The very desire to live again in that
ecstatic state is preventing the new, the fresh experience of bliss.  You see
what has happened: you had that experience, and now you are living with the
dead memory of yesterday.  What has been is preventing the new."

I am glad am not living in the dead memory of experience.  After the very
first one, I know these are going to happen and I let it happen without
seeking it.  If it happens again, I like to share if there is someone to
listen.

Regards                                                          Chelluri

Nagy read my posting again.  I am not opposed to the mind or any thing. My
statement was why should I mind my mind's perturbations, cravings, its dirt
or its glory, its experiences or lack of them, etc., etc.,., when I am not
the mind!

Never mind! Mind is not the problem. my problem rests in identifying that I
am the mind and  take its glory, its experiences, its frustrations, its
depressions  and its garbage as my attributes. This fundamental problem is
the result of not knowing my true nature.  It is not some experience I am
longing for it is just a simple understanding - I am the subject and not
the object - understanding from my experiences! - or experience my
understanding or realizing what vedanta teaches us!) - Think about it.


Now I have a request to everybody -
-to educate this mind, and also do some japla with other mind!

In the week end I was trying to gather - what sruti pramaanaas are there
that categorically establishes the advaita philosophy. - Pramaana, as it is
meant only from prastaanatraya -  I would like to have a complete list of
all mantras or sutras etc. besides the four mahaavaakyas.  Any help in
this? Has any one compiled such a list? or Is it available somewhere? - If
I cannot get the mantras at lest a reference to them!

The second part of this request is - how these particular mantras have been
tackled by the Raamaanuja or Maadva just to see how they got around the
problem! - And what is the problem - besides the logic - in their
interpretation.

I know I am asking too much - a compilation of this, I think, is important
and to be available in the archives of advaita list.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
