Thanks for clarifying some points for me re the mind.

I would like to come back to the point whether there is a problem with the
mind (my argument) and that there is no problem at all and there is only
a perception that there is a problem (Sri Chuck Hellig's point). I quote
below from Upadesa Sahasri (ch 19 where the text is put as the Self
addressing the mind. The translation quoted is from Upadesa Sahasri,
commentary by Jagadananda, Ramakrishna Math., Madras).

The Self addresses the mind:

"... It is proper for you to remain quiet. You indulge in vain ideas
like 'me' and 'mine'. You have no consciousness of things. I (the Self)
am always contented and have no desires. ..." (verse 2)

"... According to Sruti, one who is by nature beyond the six waves
(hunger, thirst, grief, delusion of the mind, old age and death of the
body) is the Self (Reference is also made to Bhagavad Gita 10.20) ..."
(verse 4)

"... In deep sleep, when the mind is merged, there is no difference left
which delude people. When awoke again, all wrong notions and delusions
start. The cause of all wrong notions is the perception by the mind of
the reality of difference. These wrong notions disappear as soon as one
is free from this perception. ..." (verse 5)

    The root cause for the perception of the reality of difference is the
    mind. That is, the mind sees only the duality. We know it is not
    correct and hence what is perceived by the mind is wrong.

"... Because I know the Truth, I am not deluded by your (mind's) efforts.
I am free from all bondage and change. ..." (verse 6)

"... It is ascertained that everything created by the mind is
non-existent. ..." (verse 7)

"... Having birth and death, you are accepted as non-existent. ..."
(verse 8)

     It is the same Self in deep sleep and in wake-up (and dream) states.
     In the deep-sleep state, the mind being merged, does not cause
     mischief. In the wake-up sate also, it is the same Self, but the
     mind sarts making mischief, because it perceives what it thinks
     is the reality of difference. That wrong notion, I believe, is
     the mischief-making factor of the mind.

     So what need to be done is to keep the mind in the same quiescent
     state as in the deep sleep state. If not, the mind creates the
     world and acts rough-shod. So how can the mind be controlled in the
     awake state ?

     I trust I have quoted the Upadesa Sahasri correctly and not out
     of context.

     I would be most grateful for any clarifications.
