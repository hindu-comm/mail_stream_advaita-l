     In truth, though, "you" havn't really "gotten" a Ph.D.at all.

     If you say that you have  "gotten" it, you are admitting that there was
an actual time when you didn't actually "have" it.

     Whatever can be "gained" (or "lost," for that matter)  is illusory.

     Only the SELF is real..
