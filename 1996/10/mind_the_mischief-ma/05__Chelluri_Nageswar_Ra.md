Sada     Greetings

I dont understand why so much opposition to the Mind.
Is it not the same mind that made you K.Sadananda a Ph.D?
Is it not the same mind of sada turned its attention to divine matters
promptly on time?

Believe me the same mind of sada eventually takes him where ever he wants to
go.
I will share a secret with you all.
All you have to do is Let the mind be a Witness to everything around you.
Tell me if am carrying a wrong secret.

Nagy
