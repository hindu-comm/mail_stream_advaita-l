      The Self is not opposed to anything.  It has no opposite so there is
never any conflict.  All change is illusory.  Nothing can be added to or
subtracted from IT to make IT any better or worse.

      IN short, IT is what IT is.

     Period.  The End.

     WHO is this so-called "one" who "lets the mind be a witness to
everything...?"   Is there the SELF.....AND the Mind?

     There is only One.  And it's a One WITHOUT a second.

     Nagy, I am not telling you that you are carrying a "wrong secret."

     No "one" is really "here" to say that to "you."

                            With Blessings,

                                     "              "
