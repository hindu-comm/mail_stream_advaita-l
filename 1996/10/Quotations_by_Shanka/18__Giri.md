Re : Life, mind

Be happy. Love yourself. Don't judge others. Forgive. Always be
simple. Don't make distinctions. Give up the habit of choice. Let the
mind dissolve. Give up preferring and desiring. Desire only your own
awareness. Give up identifying with the body and senses. Give up your
attachment to detachment. Give up giving up. Reject nothing, accept
nothing. Be still. Above all, be happy.

        -- Thomas Byrom, commenting on the essence of Ashtavakra gita.

Re : world

There are two worlds,
ego's and God's,
Rejecting as unreal the former
Recognizing the latter
Be.
