It's interesting that you juxtapose these two threads, because
Nisargadatta always had a couple of hours of bhajan chanting daily in
his ashram.....

And it is also worth reminding that his biographers show that he has
been / is a Natha-yogin; or it is well known that these guys (the
Nathas) excelled in hatha-yoga, tantric practices, vegetal alchemy, and
a lot of other lore.

With blessings,
