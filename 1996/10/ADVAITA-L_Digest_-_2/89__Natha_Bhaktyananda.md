I also agree with your point, but those cases are so few that they may
be called the "exception that confirms the general rule". Moreover, they
are based upon a faith and conviction that are so rare that they cannot
be taken as a viable method. One in a century of mankind's history is
seldom enough for anybody not to fancy that *he/she* could be the next
self-enlightened master.

With blessings,
