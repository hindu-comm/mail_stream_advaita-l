When asked why he still performed bhajan daily, Maharaj apparently
replied: "Why not?"

It was a spontaneous functioning which gave him pleasure and was partly
tradition and habit. Maharaj saw no difference between performing
bhajan, smoking a cigarette and going for a walk. But he denied that he
performed bhajan in order to "achieve" anything.

He often told the story about his realization: My guru told me I was not
the body and I believed him. I investigated the matter for myself and
found he was correct.
