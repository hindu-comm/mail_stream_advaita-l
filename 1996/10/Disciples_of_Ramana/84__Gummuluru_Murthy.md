But, aren't these the tags we attach to people ?

Any "enlightened" person will not go around, saying he/she is enlightened.
The purely "enlightened" person does not care what the world thinks of

But, in any case, why this pre-occupation with whether x is "enlightened"
or not rather than looking at ourselves ?
