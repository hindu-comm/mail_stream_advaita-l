giri has written:

The only way, as Papaji himself states, to "recognize"
a self-realized person is to "sense" how peaceful you are in his/her
presence. I think Ramana says the same.
-----------------------------

The seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to the Christian
tradition, are: Wisdom, Understanding of the Will of God, Advising to
the praise of God, Strength of Faith, Knowledge of the Law of God, Piety
(Godliness), God-fearfulness. It may give some hints as to the signs of
recognition.

giri has also written:

Though Ramana Maharshi may have denied any disciples, there are hosts of
people : Sadhu Arunachala, Balaram Reddy, Kunju Swami, Ganapati Muni etc
who claim Ramana to be their Guru and that includes Poonjaji.
-----------------------------

Interesting enough, all have appeared as *enlightened* disciples *after*
the death (mahasamadhi) of the Maharishi -- unlike the cases of
Ramakrishna, Shivannda, Yogananda, and so many others. It makes one
think of how advantageous must be in India to bask in the reputation of
a great saint like Ramana... without him being present to confirm or
infirm it.
