        Oh, really ? Did they come to you and say they were enlightened or
did you just assume it ? Please produce quotes from the four above saying
'I am enlightened.'

But what would such quotes prove?

Every charlatan says "I am enlightened".

Generally, the only fairly reliable indicators are:

- Pronouncement by that person's teacher that the person has finished
their sadhana.   This, of course, depends on the reliability of the
teacher, in turn.

- Acclaim and recognition by other respected spiritual leaders.

- Most importantly, the effect of the person in question on you - "by
their fruits ye shall know them".


Namaskar,

Ken
