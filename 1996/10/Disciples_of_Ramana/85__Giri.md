        I agree, but my point was the four people (Sadhu Arunachala,
Balaram Reddy, Kunju Swami, Ganapati Muni) mentioned never claimed to be
enlightened or a guru etc, afaik. It is wrong, imo, to slander people like
Ganapati Muni without any facts and claim that they claimed to be
enlightened after Ramana died, which is impossible as Rama pointed out.

        I agree. However, I did not like to see people being accused of
things which they never said or did.
        As I mentioned sometime back on this guru issue, if we place
importance in the outer actions of "Guru" ONLY, then we have to consider
that some people normally considered "enlightened" smoked, ate fish etc
and we seem to only associate them with their body, which is against the
spirit of their teaching itself.
        I will refrain from posting on this thread anymore.

Hello,

You have your attributions wrong.  (you have the same number of ">"
before statements that I did NOT write and before statements that I
wrote.)

You have pasted a statement from someone else, above a statement from
me from another thread saying "I agree".

This is like a cheesy political advertisement.

Please check back as to who wrote which statement and revise your
message.

I never wrote any statement in this group that had the names of any
persons other than:

- Ramana Maharshi
- Ramakrishna
- Shankara
- (possibly Yogananda in passing)

In other words, I've never posted a comment in this list about anyone
living, by name.

I've also never stated anywhere at any time "advaita strengthens the
ego".

If you are going to state "other such insinuations which he is fond
of" then you had better give quotes.
