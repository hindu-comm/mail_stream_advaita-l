Isn't mantrajapam a valid method for planting seeds of jnana?

I beg to differ.  Not only did Bhagavan *vigorously* adopt this method, He
rarely *didn't* apply it to the people who questioned Him.  And the few times
He didn't was when someone was, to site an example, in the Lecture Hall
enquiring from a dvaitic point of view, He wouldn't disturb their position;
and when they left He was sure to clarify His statements to the ashramites
and others.  It's well documented.

Additionally, the ajatavada doctrine (pure advaita) was applied by Ribhu,
Vasistha, Sankara, and is evidenced in such works as Tripura Rahasya,
Advaita Bodha Deepika, Kaivalya Navaneetham, among others.

namaste.
