How have you determined this?  Can you site an example?--without implicating
anyone--, a generalization would suffice.

As Giri pointed out, one of the foremost criteria for assessing a jnani is the
peace one may derive being in his/her company.  I don't think we as individuals
can discount the efficacy of a given teaching because it doesn't resonate with
our level of understanding.  It should be common knowledge amongst vedantists
that darshan varies with the capacity of the chela.  (I believe Ramakrishnan
alluded to this.  But my argument is that this is an advaita list, which
precludes espousing dvaita or even visisthadvaita.)

Joshi makes an excellent point about the MokshGuru.  This should shed light
on the mistake being made by followers not only of vedanta but most major
spiritual doctrines.

namaskaaram.

Okay, but this is an oversimplification, because a detailed discussion
of this case is not germane, and also because I don't have available
at the moment the exact quotes.

In one case, two disciples ended up getting into an argument, which,
amongst other things, involved them both making statements that
implied that the other was not enlightened, but instead was acting
from an egoic viewpoint.

Normally, this would allow the case that one was right and the other
was wrong, except that in this case, one was the designated
"successor" of the other.

PS  I agree that such examples should be made without reference to
specific names......


Namaskar,

Ken
