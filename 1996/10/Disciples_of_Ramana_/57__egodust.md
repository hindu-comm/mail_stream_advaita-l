I hadn't heard the term 'bhava samadhi'...but based on your description, it
sounds identical to sahaja samadhi.

I agree with your last statement, except that it depends on what sadhakas'
inclinations are.  If one needs development in bhakti, Sri Ramakrishna is
suited.  If one is ripe for jnana (which implies that bhakti is *already*
in evidence in the [now] pakva), Sri Bhagavan RM is the best, in my opinion.
(And who's to say that He left none?  What about Nisargadatta and Poonjaji?
They took chainsaws to my chit-jada granthi! hahaha!)

peace.peace.peace

namaskaaram.
