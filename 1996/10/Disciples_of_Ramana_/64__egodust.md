Ken launched this thread, questioning why so many followers of Bhagavan RM
seemed to be, in his view, "false teachers."  If this can be interpreted to
have a mundane connotation, I failed to see it.  Sue me.

Perhaps it would be better for those at the vyavaharika level to join the
dvaita list instead.  They're not ready for advaita.

If we expect to be able to help each other and inspire each other to assimilate
the way of non-duality, why would we go ahead and sanction the linear
interpretation of an *exclusive* world-appearance--technically, the triadic
sohamidam?

Also, Bhagavan employed the mownamdiksha to those questioners who were in fact,
the closest to achieving manonasa.  Rarely was He silent for reasons that the
questioner was insincere.  This is my perception of what tended to occur, but
I could be wrong.  Also, in my heart I consider Bhagavan to be Dakshinamurthi,
and since He is my guru, that means we have the same guru!  praNaam.

Hello,

If the question had been "why are there 'false teachers' in the
world", then some sort of "everything is maya" response might have
been warranted, because the question would refer to the nature of
reality in general.

However, the actual question was a specific one, ie what was the
connection between following Ramana and becoming a false teacher.

Thus, the question calls for a specific answer having to do with the
nature of Ramana's teachings and/or the nature of those who are
attracted to his teachings.


Namaskar,

Ken
