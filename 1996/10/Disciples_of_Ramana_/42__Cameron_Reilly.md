Ken,

You must ask yourself: these 'false guru's'... do they have any choice
in the matter?

If they teach, if they don't teach... what choice do 'they' have, being
only illusions?

They all play the role assigned to their particular body/mind organism.
As do we all.

Cheers,
Cameron.

When someone asks you where the bathroom is, do you reply "Your need
to use the bathroom is only an illusion." ?

I think that if Ramana had been asked where the bathroom is, he would
not reply "Who is it that thinks it needs to go to the bathroom?".
Instead, he would reply "around the corner in the back", and save the
"Who is it that thinks there is a world?" response for philosophical
questions put to him in the lecture hall.

In fact, the above is just the sort of thing that false gurus do,
their egos are so caught up in "being a guru" that they can't
distinguish between when philosophy is appropriate and when it is not.


Namaskar,

Ken
