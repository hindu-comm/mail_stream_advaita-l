I don't think that would necessarily be grounds to cancel each of them
out as being less than genuine or effective teachers.  Differences of
opinion regarding relative-world philosophy or methodological strategy
doesn't need to have any bearing on their jnana.  Even if they attack
each other, claiming the other was 'unenlightened.'  The state of the
jivanmukta is ineffable and not amenable to the polarized intellect.

It's always best to discriminate for ourselves--re what's our *own* best
course--than to cast conclusive judgements on life conditions that really
defy any sort of categorization, by their very nature [which is actually
an unsolvable mystery].

Cameron has written:

When asked why he still performed bhajan daily, Maharaj apparently
replied: "Why not?"

It was a spontaneous functioning which gave him pleasure and was partly
tradition and habit. Maharaj saw no difference between performing
bhajan, smoking a cigarette and going for a walk. But he denied that he
performed bhajan in order to "achieve" anything.
---------------------------

IMHO it is not as simple as that; one could also answer to that
question: "Why yes?" If it was *only* a matter of pleasure, tickling the
armpits would have been even better (I can think about 500 other things
in that direction now, some of them quite "unorthodox" :-). And if it
was tradition, then why not also perform some agnihoma, ashvamedha,
puja, and a host of other Indian customs? There must be some *pedagogic*
in it. As about the story with the "cigarette smoking", it can be easily
extended to alcohol drinking, coffee, pot, horseriding, domestic
violence, holy war and God knows what more, but it still seems that the
great Masters have always had quite a clear limit to what was ok -- so
there must be *some* difference!

With blessing,
