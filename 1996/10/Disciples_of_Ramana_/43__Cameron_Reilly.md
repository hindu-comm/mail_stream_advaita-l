You are probably right.

Ramana probably *would* have pointed the direction to the toilet. But
would his answer have been a matter of volition? Did Ramana have free
will? Or would his response have been spontaneous?

In the same way, any utterance made from a 'false guru' as you put it,
(I am humbled to see you infer that title on myself) is also a
spontaneous happening over which 'they' have no control. Saying their
"ego's are so caught up in being a guru" assumes the ego actually has
some sort of volition. I do not believe this is the case. What *is*
there that could possibly have volition?

May I ask, do you believe in volition?

I felt your question *was* one of philosophy. For the issue would not
concern you if you understood that the whole concept of the individual
is a mistake.

Cheers.

Cameron.

I didn't mean to infer any such thing, I certainly don't know enough
about you or anyone else on this list to even know whether anyone is a
guru, let alone false or true !  :-)

There doesn't have to be volition.   My coat can get caught in the
door, but I don't attribute volition to it.  :-)

It's not a concern to me.

I'm just curious as to why Ramana, who was so unusually clear and to
the point, would, even if indirectly, produce an unusual number of
followers who would (let me put this in terms perhaps more acceptable)
have the karma to become non-realized teachers who thought they were
realized?   (please see my earlier post which started this thread for
details)


Cheers,

In telugu, as in several other south Indian languages, there are two
'e'kaara- e and ee or E short and long, and similarly two 'o' kaara - the
short and long

>Endharo Mahaanubhavulu Antharaiki Naa Vandanamu

The correct transliteration is:

  endarO mahaanubhaavulu, andarikii naa vandanaalu

  endarO = many
  mahaanubhaavulu = great souls
  andarikii= to all of them
  naa = my
  vandanaalu= prostrations

  As Vidya pointed out this is one of the most famous Tyagaraaja kriti -
exemplying his own humility.  It is considered a measure of graduation of a
carnatic music student if he can sing this song with all the aalapana,
raaga and taala involved.
Tyagaraaja is one of the great Sri Rama bhakta and has composed thousands
of kiirthans on Sri Rama and one of the back bones of carnatic music.
