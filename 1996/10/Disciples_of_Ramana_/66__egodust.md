How have you determined this?  Can you site an example?--without implicating
anyone--, a generalization would suffice.

As Giri pointed out, one of the foremost criteria for assessing a jnani is the
peace one may derive being in his/her company.  I don't think we as individuals
can discount the efficacy of a given teaching because it doesn't resonate with
our level of understanding.  It should be common knowledge amongst vedantists
that darshan varies with the capacity of the chela.  (I believe Ramakrishnan
alluded to this.  But my argument is that this is an advaita list, which
precludes espousing dvaita or even visisthadvaita.)

namaskaaram.
