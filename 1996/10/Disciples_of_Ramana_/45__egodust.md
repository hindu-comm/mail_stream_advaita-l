Can anyone here prove that they are NOT Self-realized?

By what parameters?
That the Mind enslaves the soul?
That the ego causes living nightmares?
That there isn't peace, love, well-being?

That Ignorance abounds?

What *IS* Ignorance, anyway?
No, really!
Does it have any self-sustaining reality?
Can it be pinned down and pointed to?
And if [you think] it can, who or what generates it?

The tiny Mind is a Master Illusionist!...that's who.
Running in vaster and vaster subtle cunning circles.

On the contrary, whether it's found to be empty
or real, has *no effect* on the truth in the Heart!

(Why should this be doubted?  Who's exempt from it?)

No.  Self-realization is the simplest thing in the world
because Jesus said "Unless ye have the mind of a child,
ye cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven."

We *ALL* said that through Him, once and forever.

namaste.

realize (r=EA=B4e-l=ECz=B4) verb
realized, realizing, realizes verb, transitive
1.      To comprehend completely or correctly.

So, "Self-realization" is comprehending the Self.

Comprehension of the Self is not always occurring, and the point of
sadhana or self-enquiry, as advocated by Ramana Maharshi, is to remove
the lack of comprehension, so that comprehension is occurring 24 hours
a day.

Again I fail to see what this has to do with this thread.


Namaskar,

Ken
