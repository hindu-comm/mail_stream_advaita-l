I apologize for not further qualifying my reply.

I'm well aware of the preparation required prior to meeting with the
doctrine of advaita.  In this regard, bhakti, raja, karma, and other
yogas are of course vital prerequisites, especially for anyone
specifically deficient in certain areas.  Upon their being sufficiently
developed, they are only then ready for the jnanamarga.

However, this is an advaita list.  Why would anyone consider it
inappropriate to expound advaita?

namaste.
