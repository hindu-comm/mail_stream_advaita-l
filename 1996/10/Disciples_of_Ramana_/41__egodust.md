Excellent observation--although not a difficult one to see, as it is quite
pervasive.

Bhagavan's teachings are so direct and simple (and in this sense effective),
that people who sincerely follow and absorb them to any appreciable degree,
can't help but come away at least egoistically fractured, if not shattered...
the Self automatically starts taking over; albeit awkwardly perhaps.

On the higher turn of the spiral of *What IS*, all the talk about ignorant
individuals amounts to dust in a dream.  The alleged Mind is the Judgement
Machine that cripples, smothers, and jails the Free Self--if that's even
possible to do!

In fact, it isn't!  'False Gurus' cannot therefore exist.

namaste.
