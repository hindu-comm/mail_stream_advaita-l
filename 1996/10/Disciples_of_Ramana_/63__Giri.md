        Certainly not. i did not imply you did, of course. As i noted in
my previous e-mail, it SEEMS that the posting of the site on Poonjaji
prompted a discussion of "false teachers who are disciples of Ramana."
        Regarding the question of lineage, i was just pointing out that,
as far as i know, poonjaji never claimed to be in a "lineage" of Ramana
Maharshi.  Therefore, there may be "false" teachers and claim to be
disciples of Ramana, they don't claim to be in some sort of paramparic
lineage. Of course, i may be wrong. Thus, one cannot correlate "false
teachers under Ramana" is more etc, because *anyone* can claim to be a
disciple of Ramana.

Namaste.
