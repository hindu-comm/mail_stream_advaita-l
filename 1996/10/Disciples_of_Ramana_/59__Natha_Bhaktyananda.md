I would only say that very, very few are ripe for that kind of jnana, as
 experience
shows it. As about the two gentlemen you are asking, I don't know them
 personally; I
have just flipped through some of their books and found nothing there or in
 their
actions as heart-shaking as with Ramana Maharishi. That of course is IMHO.

With blessings,

PS. It is almost correct about the "sahaja samadhi", although there still seem
 to be
some metaphysical differences between it and the bhava samadhi.

It's interesting that you juxtapose these two threads, because
Nisargadatta always had a couple of hours of bhajan chanting daily in
his ashram.....
