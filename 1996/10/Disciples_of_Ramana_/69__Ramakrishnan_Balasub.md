I think I owe an apology to egodust here. I failed to read into Ken's
question like egodust quickly did.

If I had known that this was another of Ken's "advaita strengthens the ego"
and other such insinuations which he is fond of, I would have just kept quiet.
Instead I misunderstood it as a concern (which I have) that many people are
utilizing Ramana Maharshi's name and some of them in a seemingly dubious
manner.

Very nice to have cosy agreements here, but I must point out that none of the
people mentioned above (I do not know anything about Poonaji) ever claimed to
be enlightened or acted as a "guru" at anytime. It was claimed that all these
people claimed to be enlightened after Ramana M's passing away. Please get your
facts straight. Ganapati Muni died much before RM. Further all these devotees
were known for the simplicity, humility and devotion to their guru. I find it
extremely disgusting that some people are spreading false allegations against
such people to give credence to their own pet theories and/or organizations.
Enough said.

Ramakrishnan.
