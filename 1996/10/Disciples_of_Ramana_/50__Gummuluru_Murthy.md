Well, my feeling is it is a concept that cannot be proved. If one is
Self-realized (meaning of that being what it is), the requirement of
"proof" will loose its meaning. No need of a proof for such a state.
Who are you proving it to ? And who is proving it ?

I am afraid proof and state of Self-realization are to some extent
mutually non-coexistent.
