As Bhagavan always tells us:  "Are there two selves? One to comprehend the
other?"

The entire Quest implied via "Who am I?" is to expose the fallacy of the
limited [ego] self "who's attempting to realize everything."  The whole idea
of there being a 'Witness' is a very fundamental blunder.  Just as we attempt
to locate the presumed big Mind, so equally becomes our failure to finally
locate the presumed amazing ego!  These things only thrive because we don't
investigate them.

(That we're duped into thinking the Mind is big or the ego amazing is because
there surely is a component within each that's effulgent with Reality, and
that's nothing other than the Substratum 'universal' Self.  We obviously
know this.  So where's the problem?  Is this a dvaita list?)

namaskar.

So, according to this logic, why bother to have an advaita list at
all?

Why should Ramana have ever said anything at all?

While all your statements are true, I think you are still missing
something....  perhaps someone else out there understands what I am
getting at?


Namaskar,
