It is a good idea to have a glossary of sanskrit terms used in advaita
like the glossaries for yoga and astrology (which are already on the
WWW). A good starting point is to use the words given in the glossary
books written by Eaknath Easwaran and Aurobindo. There is also a glossary
of vedanta terms in the book by Swami Vivekananda called Vedanta
philosophy. I am not sure about copyright problems, which is one of the
reasons why the word meanings of the gita published by many people have not
been uploaded to the dictionary of the jaguar site.
        Regarding Srimad bhagvatam, there are some excellent books out
there like the 5/4 volume editions by Sastri, Tapasyananda, etc and the
two volume edition by the Gita press besides the one published by BBT.
The following is published (though I don't necessarily concur with its
meanings] by the American Gita society, which conducts free gita lessons.

EPILOGUE The Farewell Message of Lord Krishna

Lord Krishna on the eve of His departure from the arena of this
world, after finishing the difficult task of establishing Dharma,
gave His last parting discourse to His uncle Uddhava who was also
His dearest devotee and follower. At the end of a long sermon
comprising of more than one thousand verses  Uddhava said: O Lord,
I think the pursuit of yoga as You narrated (to Arjuna, and now) to
me, is very difficult, indeed, for most people, because it entails
control of the unruly senses. Please tell me a short, simple, and
easy way to God-realization. Lord Krishna upon Uddhava's request
gave the essentials of Self-realization for the modern age as
follows:

(1) Do your duty, to the best of your abilities, for the Lord
without any selfish motive, and remember God at all times -- before
starting a work, at the completion of a task, and while inactive.

(2) Practice to look upon all creatures as Myself in thought, word,
and deed; and mentally bow down to them.

(3) Awaken your dormant Kundalini power -- by using yogic
techniques -- and perceive that the power of God is with you at all
times; through the activities of mind, senses, breathing, and
emotions; and is constantly doing all the work using you as a mere
instrument. Paramahamsa Hariharananda says: God is in everything as
well as above everything.
