        You had once mentioned in the net about the Kundalini yoga.
Could you give me a brief account of your experience and the practice to
activate it.
        Please let me know that which you can let me know and that which
you have experienced.  Manytimes the some secrets are not divulged to all
and only a SAT GURU will do it when he finds a suitable student.
        You had mentioned that with your GURUS grace you were able to still
your mind for some time.  Please let me know that experience as closet as
possible in words.

with love
