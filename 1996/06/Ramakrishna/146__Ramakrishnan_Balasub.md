This is going to be my last post on this subject. Please read my statements
carefully before refuting my statements on ramaNa. I have read almost every
publication from the ramanaashram gazillion times and in expositions of ramaNa,
people usually neglect to add qualifiers to their statements. It's important to
read the talks and ramaNa's own works etc to get a whole picture.

Anyone living in thiruvaNNaamalai gets salvation according to the skanda. "Such
is the order of Shiva" - by ramaNa. The point is that only people whose
prarabdha allows staying in thiruvaNNaamalai get to stay there. Try however you
may, you won't be able to do it unless your prarabdha allows it. Same goes for
dying in Benares. ramaNa has said that whether one believes it or not living in
thiruvaNNaamalai grants realization.

You forgot to notice "Others are also quite valid as they lead to purification
of the mind, and automatically _result_ in self enquiry.". This holds true for
surrender also. Complete surrender is synonymous with realization, which
results from enquiry _only_. This point is quite clear from the talks.

Complete surrender = realization according to ramaNa. He has also said partial
surrender will lead to complete surrender to one Maharani who visited him.

It may be so as you say. I am not very well read about Ramakrishna. However the
fact is that his quotes on samaadhi directly contradict both ramaNa and
shaMkara. This does not mean he was not an advaitin. Various advaitins have
contradicted each other.

> I distinctly remember RamaNa recommending Bhakti in his "talks".
> What exactly is the advaitic notion of Bhakti?

ramaNa has also recommended praaNaayaama and hatha yoga. He recommended
iishvara aaraadhana for mind control also. Complete absorption in the self =
realization = bhakti according to ramaNa. This bhakti is different from the
usual concept of bhakti. In other words the JNaani is alone a bhakta.

You are introducing straw men into the argument un-necessarily. The gauDapaada
kaarikaa has to be read as a whole to understand it. Not, random quotes from it

Note: In the above, I am merely quoting ramaNa. The statements about complete
surrender=realization has not been realized by me.

 Brahman)

Different only in words. The idea behind both is _exactly_ the same, whether
P.T.Raju agrees or not (whoever he may be).

Says everything that needs to be said. In another place he has said the same
thing and that surrender will lead automatically to enquiry.

I think we are in complete agreement here. Thanks for the quotes.

Correct.

Fine. But it does not contradict my quote from ramaNa that there is only one
path and only one goal. In other places ramaNa has said tantrik saadhana leads
to realization. All paths are good for purification of the mind, which result
in self-enquiry. This is the statement of ramaNa. Note that ramaNa used "grace"
in a different sense from what is usually perceived. He has said "Grace is
always present. It is upto one to take it." This should have been added to the
above statement to make his teachings perfectly clear. The above statement
which you give, taken alone, may give a totally different idea from what ramaNa
actually meant. The statement of his "Grace is always present. ...", makes it
crystal clear, what he meant.

Ramakrishnan.
