This is true in the earlier and middling stages of the various yogic
approaches.  Once the jiva embarks upon the core of advaita (which
involves the vicharamarga), the classical barrier between devotee
and guru begins to collapse.  Not the relationship itself, but the
sense of separativeness starts to yield.  This is why the guru is
sometimes regarded as one's father, brother, friend and even child.

And beyond this, the guru is said to dwell in one's own heart:
Beyond the classical [dvaitic] bhakti is the [advaitic] ekhabhakti
(single-pointed devotion to jnana embodied by the guru within--
the paramatman).

When the atmavichara is applied, results can vary.  In my own case,
after 30 years or so (the last 2+ in the form of mantrajapa), I no
longer dwell on whether or not I'm liberated.  I've come to consider
the question itself as a farce.  My personality is a non-consideration.

Language can never be anything more than an indicator pointing to the Absolute
Truth.  How can it be stated directly?  Sri Bhagavan RM used silence as His
vehicle for diksha.  He said it was the most effective method of transmission.
Even if one were capable of verbalizing it, wouldn't they also have the wisdom
to know who and when to convey it to or not?

Namaskaaram to my fellow devotee. praNaam.
