Namaste.

Nothing.  Simply because the whole procedure entails the Mind itself
engaging in the process of extinguishing itself.  What other phenomenon
can assume its role [of egoic reference] before it's destroyed?

By steadily responding to "nan yar" with the understanding that NO
conceivable answer can suffice.  Eventually the Mind relinquishes
its obsession with judgements (thoughts).  What follows in its wake
can't be defined, only experienced.

Let it supply answers.  Only you know that they can't possibly
define the Atmanishta.  Therefore the "answers" are meaningless,
whatever they are, no matter how centered in the ideal archetype
of spiritual reality.  The quest for Self transcends all concepts
and precepts.  No relative framework can possibly be settled upon!

Of course.  It rebels vigorously when threatened.  And the atmavichara
is its greatest enemy in the world!  It will act out ANY role to get
attention and regain the upper hand.  Whenever it causes any moods
or other theatrics, question it further!  "Who's feeling this mood?"
Ans: "I am."  Question: "Who am I?"  Keep returning to the nan yar.
Be relentless.

Only steady sadhana will turn the table on this deception.

Until a no-Mind moment hits, no-one can really appreciate why the
Mind has to be rejected.  This is why, in the beginning, we have to
put our faith in the sastras and sages telling us that the Mind needs
to be transcended before we can hope to return to our natural state.

Like fire fighting fire; when the fuel is spent, ALL the fire goes out.

As Sri Ramakrishna always tells us, "As one thorn is used to pluck
another from the skin, when it's dislodged, both are discarded."

Hope this helped!

Namaskaaram.  Hari OM.
