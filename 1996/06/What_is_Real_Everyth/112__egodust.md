Is the experience of samadhi itself logical?  One may (or may not!) use
logic to induce samadhi, but within its *primal current* is logic being
ACTIVELY utilized in order to maintain it?

This is what I've been trying to say all along.  Not that logic isn't
a valid approach *en route* to Liberation.  (Also, the application of
illogic is an equally valid approach {vide: zen}).  Remember, the whole
point is diffusing the tyranny of the Mind that otherwise obsesses on
putting a distracting spin on the natural state of satchidananda.

Namaste.
