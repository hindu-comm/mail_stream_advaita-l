IAN: If samadhi is true, and if logic means true, then samadhi is logical.

IAN: Samadhi does have relative characteristics, the mind and its myriad
of relations, relative to which the not-mind of samadhi is "samadhi."
Not-mind is not-mind relative to mind, therefore, the existence
of not-mind implies the existence of mind which is therefore
a necessary relative characteristic of not-mind.
In this way, the Self contains all.

IAN: You've not shown that samadhi is not relative, or that even
if it is not relative, that it is therefore not logical.

IAN: There are many ideas, some are logical -- why is this one of them?
(May be a good topic for a separate thread.)

IAN: The real cannot be slain.

IAN: Reality is the application of logic. You don't need to do anything.

IAN: Those who do not want to apply formulas or methods need
not apply them, at any time. I make no recommendations.

IAN: This separation between logic and the absolute is merely assumed,
I've not seen a case presented to support it. I've not seen a case
to support the claim of any separation / duality.



Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = {A, ~A}

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A
