As best I can tell, samadhi is within yet beyond logic and illogic.  If this,
in turn, can be defined as logic, then 'logic' can mean virtually anything.
Samadhi is the *experience* of the Absolute.  The Absolute has no relative
characteristics.  How can samadhi, therefore, be ITSELF logical or [as you
stated later in the post] of "the clear light" or any other feature?  The
closest accurate description is perhaps 'void', yet this is *very* misleading,
having caused people to equate it with nihilism.  The vedantins have come
up with the idea--in attempting to describe the indescribable--that it's
conveyed in terms of: not not-Being, not not-Consciousness, not not-Bliss.
And they're quick to caution us to forget even that definition, so as not to
cause the Mind to get attached to yet another concept. "The Mind is the slayer
of the Real."

As I've attempted to point out several times, I concur with your approach.
It works quite well.  Our only point of contention is (as I've finally been
able to clearly state above): Is logic something that needs to be ACTIVELY
APPLIED in order to sustain the samadhi state?  Do we have to continuously
                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
apply these formulas and methods, for example, AFTER jivanmukti (permanent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Liberation)?  Logic (as well as ALL methods, including Self-enquiry) is a
means, not an end.  Once the goal is reached, the method can be discarded.

Namaste.
