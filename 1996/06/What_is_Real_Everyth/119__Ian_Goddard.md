IAN: If we say that state X is absolute and contains no relative attributes,
we've just identified attributes that are unique to X, and that define X as
" X ". As this unique identity of X is unique only * relative * to all
those states that do posses relative attributes, state X is relative.
In this way, the absolute (A) is shown to be relative (~A)
and relativity per se, is show to be absolute;
ergo, A = ~A.

IAN: There is no data contrary to the Self, thus no quantity
of data represents a departure from the self. Due to the
mechanics of relational identity, the arising of
thoughts is the nonarising of thoughts,
precisely because each concept A is
"A" only relative to a polar -A,
ergo A = A + -A = 0.

Why draw a false division between the Self and the mind?
That assumed division is the only 'mind trap.'

IAN: Exactly: if bondage is freedom, if A is ~A, there is no distinction.

IAN: Knowledge is not other than the Self. If the experience that
the Self contains all things is a delusion, then I am a delusion.

IAN: To know the nature of thoughts, one must know not-thought.
Knowing not-thought, one perceives that thought and
not-thought are not-two.

Not-thought is not-thought relative to thought, therefore
T is the origin of not-T and vice verse, thus the two
are not-two. Nothing is external to the Self.

IAN: When they observe that the two are not-two.
How about a little noduality here?!  |^)

IAN: The Self is never bound. The Self is ever free.
Why all this oppressive and fearful ideation?



Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = {A, ~A}

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A

And I'm sure his reply will be:

" The states you talk about are only a small part of the glorious being of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

To merge into Brahman is to lose the opportunity of becoming something far
more and far better - the eternal servant, devotee, and lover of the Lord,
Narayana. "

etc. etc.

It's not something that one can determine for sure, until one has been both
Sri Radha and Ramana Maharshi.  :-)

Actually, probably the only person who has done so, and has written about it,
is Sri Ramakrishna, and his writings on Personal God vs. Advaita are of
interest [ and can be obtained at vedanta at aol.com (to whom I have no
connection) ].


Namaskar,

"The ego arises from the mistaken notion that the light of consciousness
reflected in the intellect and coloured by objectively perceived phenomena
is the true nature of the Self.  Thus, the personal ego falsely identifies
the Self with that which is not the Self and vice versa." - Mark Dyczkowski
