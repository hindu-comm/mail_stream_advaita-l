Namaskaram
        What you say is true. There is no difference between Bhakti and Jnana.
In Jnana you Say "I am that" and identify yourself with the Self.  In bhakti
you say " Thy are the Doer i am thy servant" and also "All this is Thy
manifestation".  The choice depends ones aptitude.
        Sri Ramakrishna used to say I do not want to be sugar I want to
taste it and enjoy it.  He used to say " I want to enjoy the Lila of the
Mother".
        He used to say that Some belong to realm of the formless God and
some to God with form.  Its like the same mother feeding her different children
food suitable to there choice or aptitude.
        He sued to say Once a person becomes a True jnani and destroys the
ego he cannot maintain the body, he will give it up.
        Sankaracharya, ramanujacharja kept the ego of knowledge so that
they can serve the world.  He used say about Swami Vivekananda -"He belongs to
releam of formless God.  Once he Knows who he is He will give up his body"
        I was only stating my choice but not distinguishing that Bhakti and
Jnana parts are separate.
