IAN: I am. I am the neutral (0) witness and the (+/-) mind.
Both are the same. Both nobody (0) and somebody (+/-) sees and thinks.

IAN: How is it that self-knowledge is possible? Hmm..?? I believe it
is the result of unique neurological conditions. Something in the
brain "taps" free I am (as the mirrors reflect the sun) causing
the free I am to appear to be localized in a head.

The full scale enlightenment experience is the result, I believe,
of the "physical" mechanism that "taps" free I am being shut down.
The result is a "crack" in the mind program.

Remember that Ramana Maharashi first saw the light after being hit
in the head at a youth boxing class. I believe that the evidence
indicates that Ramana was, at least as seen on the surface, a
normal young man headed in a normal direction, and suddenly,
after a vicious blow to the head, saw light and became a
"new person." Whatever happened exactly I can't say, but
clearly the "I am tapping mechanism" was physically
damaged and shut down, the result was a crack and
thus a hole in the mind/wall program via which
the clear light of truth & freedom shone.

All know "methods" to see the light seek to throw
the mind out of its normal pattern and thus to override the
I am tapping mechanism and see that which is beyond the local mind.
