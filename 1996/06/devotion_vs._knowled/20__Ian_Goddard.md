IAN: Neither can I, but it's like reflecting the sun in a mirror,
an analogy made in vedantic scripture. The mind somehow reflects,
captures or "taps" into the free I am. The problem with the analogy
is that the Self is not apart from the mirror/mind, the Self occupies
equally all space and time.

IAN: There is what is. As the Self is all that is, the Self is
the only physical reality.

IAN: He already is enlightened. Will "he" know this? I don't know.

IAN: Just looked for the book I read about this in, and I can't find it
or recall its name. D'oh! I've released so many of my books and even
many good ones. I clearly recall reading that as a young man Ramana
was into boxing, and after a serious blow was knocked out and woke
up seeing the light. He then left town and went to a temple and then
to mount Arunachala. One of the all too many books I still have gives
a different account as stated by Ramana himself! ?? I know that I read
what I read, but I cannot prove it now. Alas, Ramamna is not even Ramana.


  > do you say you are nobody and a mind or nobody and have a mind?


IAN: Both. The mind is nobody, nobody is the mind.
The Self, which is nobody, is all that is.
