Here's something that came to me yesterday (more likely I've read it
somewhere...not sure though).  Anyway, it may prove helpful/insightful.

                            **********

Defining samadhi is technically impossible.  However, it can effectively
be alluded to in terms of the familiar Mind-phases; to wit:

Samadhi is a blend of jagrat and sushupti (the waking and deep-sleep
states). It combines the awareness of jagrat with the emptiness of
sushupti.  In effect, therefore, the jiva--immersed in the Self--is
empty and awake.*

* This is equivalent to dwelling in cidakasa, which is the suddha chit
(pure consciousness) state, which lies at the experiential hub of the
tripura sat-chit-ananda.  The movement into pure chit automatically confers
the sat and ananda, which are its integral components (just as heat and
light are integral components of fire).  If we take care to analyze it,
it turns out to be quite simple, really.  The concept 'empty and awake' is
powerful because it's clean.  And it drives to the very heart of cidakasa.
