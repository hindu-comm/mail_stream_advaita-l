Namaskaram
        Yes I have seen this movie in december last year.  I liked it.  Its one
of the films that aimed at trying to link science and spirit. I enjoyed
 Einstiens ideas on consciousness.

I have seen your homepage and I liked it. I believe in Advaita but I love
bhakti philosophy and practise it.  I enjoy Swami Ramakrishna Paramahamsas
teachings.
with love
