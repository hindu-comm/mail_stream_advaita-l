Concur.  Except the refutation that there's no prarabdha to exhaust.  Perhaps
you're alluding to the idea that the jivanmukta has consciously transcended
all karma, including prarabdha?--which I agree with wholeheartedly--, however,
it's my understanding that the prarabdha still relates to the mortal coil and
its activities within the world-appearance.  As the popular metaphor suggests:
"When the fan is switched off, the blade will spin for some time."

It's also more accurate to say--as you suggest--that Isvara efficiently
utilizes and directs the already-developed upadhis of the jnani where and
how He sees fit, and not the Parabrahmam [which has nothing to do with the
relative world-projection].

Namaste.
