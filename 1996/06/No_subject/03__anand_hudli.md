  I agree. One has to be a jiivanmukta to make statements such as
  the one I made above and really know the significance of the statement.
  I am no jiivanmukta (or jnaani) and I can even find many people who will
  testify to that effect. :-) For one thing, I am not leading a life of
  renunciation which is so essential, as per Shankara. See for example,
  his commentary on Mundaka Upanishad 3.2.4.

  What I actually meant in my earlier message is that from point of view
  of a Brahman-realized person all words are meaningless. The upanishad
  says that words do not reach It (Brahman).

  Now the question is: Should a non-jiivanmukta talk like a jiivanmukta
  or not? I will try to answer this question and I request others to
  say what they feel.

  Take your example of the novice aspiring to be a great violinist. The
  novice talks like the virtuoso. If that makes the novice feel good,
  strengthens his enthusiasm to learn music, and makes him work harder
  towards his goal, there is no problem. Let him talk like a virtuoso.
  But if talking like an expert affects him negatively such as
  making him self-conceited, making  him
  look down upon others like him, making  him complacent and lazy in
  working towards his goal, then there is a problem.
