IAN: I know what your saying: the description does not contain the described.
A description of an aroma cannot convey that aroma, it always falls short.
But are the description and the described a duality? No. Here's why:

When we "circumscribe," or draw a circle, and call the area inside it
"area A," we've defined area A. Yet in so doing we also define the
complementary external area ~A that surround the internal area.
A <=> ~A. We cannot define internal A more than we
simultaneously define the external ~A.

In this fashion, this letter > A < defines and is defined *equally* by
both internal and external. Each area being implicit and necessary
features of A, are thus parts of A, and thus A contains the whole.

Therefore all circumscriptions, such as words or visual symbols,
imply / contain the whole of space and time inwhich they appear,
and thus every description contains the described, just as your
hard drive (which "A" might represent) is contained in the
external area of the letter above. Nothing is apart or
other than the whole.


An interesting observation:

If the statement > All statements about the truth are false < is true,
then it, being a statement about the truth (defining it as beyond words),
is false. If it is false, then all statements about the truth are true.
As it is itself one of those statements, it is true, yet if it is
true it is false, if false then true, if....  A <=> ~A

The truth, the whole, contains all words, and each word contains the whole.

IAN: Samadhi is eternal. The eternal cannot be interrupted. Samadhi
is the whole, the whole cannot be broken. It can only be broken
into (+) and (-), both of which contain one another and thus
the whole, which therefore remains always unbroken.

Yet in the experience of duality, it appears to be broken, A free from ~A.
The "field of mind" is part of the texture of the Self. The sum of all
its features never exceed the Self -- which is null and void, i.e., 0
-- because every (+) is paired with a (-); thus all manifestations
and the myriad of thought forms are never other than the Self.
There is always symmetry in the net total.

IAN: Thoughts are not-thoughts: just as a wave is composed of peaks (A)
and valleys (~A) and is both, so too thoughts are composed of peaks
and valleys. The peak is the thought, the valley is the not-thought
that surrounds and defines every thought. A sound is defined by
the silence, or not-sound, that surrounds it in time, thus
a sound = (sound + not-sound), thought = not-thought.
If there was 100% sound without beginning or end,
there would be no sounds. If there was 100%
of white light bliss, there would be no
white light bliss. The dark defines
the light, the mind defines the
Self -- mind is necessary,
 and yet null.

As thoughts are derived from the relation of thought / not-thought,
if we discard thought, we must also discard not-thought.
If we discard the false, we discard the true.
If we discard ~A we discard A, for
A is A only relative to ~A.

IAN: Silence says it all. Silence is sound.



Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = {A, ~A}

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A
