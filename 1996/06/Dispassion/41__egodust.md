Undoubtedly.  The grandiose delusion is thinking we have a choice at *any*
point in time.  Before mukthi (Liberation), the jiva (soul) is conditioned
due to ignorance = no real free will; after mukthi, the jiva is the perfect
instument of isvara = confirmed absence of free will or choice (in fact,
confirmed freedom FROM choice = paranirvana {the flame [of ego-Mind] blown
out permanently}).

Incidentally, Bhagavan RM says that mukthi delivers the jiva beyond even the
realm of free-will *or* fate (choice or karma).  Neither is a philosophical
consideration = paraparanirvana.

Prashaanthi.
