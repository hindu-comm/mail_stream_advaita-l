IAN: I am not sure I follow what you mean by "cause" as it's used above,
or what "it" is when you say "..to consider that it is the Cause..."

A thing, A, is not a cause unto itself in that it cannot arise
independent of ~A, but I am not sure that addresses your point.

IAN: The only obstacle is the thought "there are obstacles."

An obstacle can stand between distant points (if we assume a
point is confined to its internal area), but I Am is always
right here right now, never over there and then. 'Obstacle'
implies separation and duality -- that is the fallacy.



Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = {A, ~A}

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A
