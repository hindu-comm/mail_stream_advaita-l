Any statement regarding Parabrahmam (Absolute Being) is necessarily
false; because the Limitless cannot be circumscribed by any thought, word or
deed.  Yet, the 'tailoring of statements about the absolute' is necessary
as a means to pull the Mind out of its relativity trap.  Once that's
accomplished, such concepts become obsolete.

As I stated in an earlier post:
Samadhi is allergic to thought.  Thought fractures it like lightning!

Whether it's logical or not, thought, per se, is useful as a *means* to
the end: which is best described as Sat-Chit-Ananda (pure Being; pure
Consciousness; pure Bliss).  Nowhere in the EXPERIENCE ITSELF is thought
upheld as any *active* dynamic *creating* the experience.  Thought (for
example, in the form of a philosophy such as advaita or zen or the tao
or gnostic christianity or kabala, etc.) performs the *vital* function
of hopefully liberating the bound ego from its delusion. Again, when its
mission is accomplished, what the value to preserve it?

Yes.  The ajata doctrine of advaita in plain english.

I wrote something last night, and was going to add it to the post before this
one, as an elaboration to what I was trying [and failing] to convey:

The most accurate thing we can say about the nature of sohamidam (God, the Ego,
and the World-appearance) is to say nothing at all.  Silence "outer and inner"
is the supreme answer to the riddle of Life.

HARI OM NAMAH SRI DAKSHINAMOORTHI.
