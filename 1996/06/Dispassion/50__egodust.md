Now you're getting on my nerves. (hahaha! 8-D)

This analogy can only work if your talking about drawing a circle on an infinte
plane of space or [hypothetically] some singular and homogenous substance.
Otherwise it fails--at least from the wholistic perspective.  That is, although
the Particular Effect is never anything intrinsically segregated from the
Universal Cause, to consider that it is the Cause *unto itself*, whole and
complete, is erroneous.  If that were the case, the ego Effect, *unto itself*,
could be relied upon unreservedly.

a statement *about* statements about the truth.

At any rate, this is a good example of how the Mind can take us on incredible
journeys...that wind up right back where we started: confused and bewildered.

***************

I'm sure you realize [but I'd like to clarify] that there's never been an
argument against your method here.  In fact, I've used it myself [in a slightly
different form--and a less effective one, I might add] for over 30 years.
My only point of contention [in this debate] is that logic, being a
product of thought, cannot have an ultimate value (viz.: that it functions
as a strategic *means* to an end; that once it's accomplished its mission, it
has no further 'executive' purpose.  And furthermore, that upon one's arriving
at the threshold to the final Release {renunciation of ego}, it may actually
prove to be an obstacle!).

As per your [regarded] logical approach: it works perfectly!  It overwhelmingly
illustrates, for example, that illusion arises only if and when a given thing
or event is believed to exist *independent* [or disconnected] from everything
else.  Proving, mathematically and philosophically, the impossibility of
duality.  Yet, as Ramakrishna always says: "after the thorn is used to pluck
out another from under the skin, both are discarded," so is the logic of
advaita, after it's dislodged the ordeal of the logic of Mind [actively
applied to endless judgements, begetting endless sufferings], also discarded.
Whereupon we return to what we ALREADY are.  And nothing's happened.

Namaskaaram.
