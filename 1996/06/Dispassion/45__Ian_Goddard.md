IAN: This, I believe, brings up the matter of levels in nondualist
teachings. Is it proper to tailor statements about the absolute
truth to accommodate different "levels"? If so why?

IAN: Reason is logical thinking. I define logic as simply "that which is
true." Accordingly, logical thinking is thought that leads to or defines
the truth. Logic -- i.e., the truth -- is the instantaneous reality that
is the I am-here-now reality free-base. Logical thinking is not a curse
to be feared but a celebration of the truth. Thought binds no one.

IAN: Can we destroy or throw away that which is null and void?
What is "away" ?

As we know: Atman (I am part) and Brahman (I am whole) are not
two, (part = whole). Mind and I Am are not two. Everything is
in I Am, nothing deviates or leads away from I Am. There is
not two; there is no division, no duality, thus no levels.

Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = {A, ~A}

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A
