dear ian (or ej?)
to say that two (A = ~A or nobody is somebody) are one,
seems only like silly mind chatter (or no-mind silence)
you (or not you)
are the genius (or not) though,
i (or nobody) hate math
in Him (or not)
who isn't (or is)
you (or nobody)
ej(or ian ?)

ps - isn't using > simultaneity =occurance together (2?) at the same time
                       and
                 >non-duality= not two,
in the same sentance an oxymoron or does this truth of logic and reason have
it's own dictionary?
in Him
love
e.j.
