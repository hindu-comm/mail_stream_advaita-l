IAN: Everything is everything. Regarding mind chatter:
the effort to most effectively systematize and refine
nondualist theory/experience is specifically the
effort to reduce the volume of mind-chatter
necessary to impart a understanding of
reality to those interested in "what
is the truth."

Just this statement  A = ~A , says it all. The mind
chatter is the quantity of data necessary to
explain it.

As jnana yoga observes, it is knowledge/mind that gets you
into delusion, it is knowledge and mind that will get you out.
Egodust argues that at this point, all such formalizations can
be discarded; which is true de facto, for all phenomena are, after
the seeing of the light, discarded through the realization that
"is" is the same as "not," and that all things are the same
thing. At this point the mind is seen to be an automatic
function devoid of a free will operator or "spirit,"
as Egodust also observes. There is only the pure
being of the Self, and it knows no bounds.
All that appears is not other than the
self-same Self, ergo I am you.

IAN: If you mean to say that saying "two events" and saying "not-two"
is a contradiction, consider that if you cannot seperate two features
from one another without the simultaneous elimination of both, the
two are "one" -- thus they are nondual -- and as one, they are
none or no thing. There is no contradiction.

The only contradiction is between dualist logic -- the claim
that A is A free from ~A -- and physical reality,
which proves that A is A only relative to ~A,
i.e., A is A only as derived from a set
that contains both {A, ~A}. As A is
equally dependent upon both A and
~A, A is equally both A and ~A.
Thus there is two and not-two.



Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = {A, ~A}

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A
