No offence intended, but isn't discussion the purpose of a mailing list? Many
of us are not jnaani's here. There are atleast two ajnaanis, me and Anand (
since he said so in his post :-)). People like us have to discuss etc to clear
doubts. If there are no doubts to be cleared, one should either clear the
doubts of others or not participate in discussions, atleast as long as the
persons asking the questions are sincere.

I seriously doubt if a jnaani can be found on the internet :-). I am afraid
that you'll have to put up with the caprices of ajnaanis like us.
