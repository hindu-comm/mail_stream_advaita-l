Vidyasankar and others,

AVP, Arsha Vidya Pitham, in Saylorsburg, PA is an Advaita ashrama run by
Swami Dayananda. They have printed a glossary of about 50 pages of technical
Advaitic terms probably most suitable for your needs. Perhaps they would be
willing to allow you to post it on your web site. Their email address is
arsha at epix.net.

-Michael
