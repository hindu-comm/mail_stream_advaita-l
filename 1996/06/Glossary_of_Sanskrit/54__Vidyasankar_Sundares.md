I think it is highly relevant. I have got quite a few mails from people who
have read the advaita home page, asking me to put up a glossary of terms used
commonly there. I have most often directed them to the jaguar site, to search
for dictionary meanings. I find that it is useful to retain the originalskt.
terms, rather than translate into English all the time. Particularly, words
like mAyA, avidyA, Atman, etc. which have philosophical connotations that are
not captured by one English word.

If people think that it would be helpful to have a glossary of terms specific
to advaita, I can do that at my site. I would also really appreciate any help
in putting such a glossary together.
