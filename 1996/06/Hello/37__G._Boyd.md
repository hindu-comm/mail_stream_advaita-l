Namaskars,

My name is Graham Boyd, of Scarborough in England.

I am a long-standing devotee of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and
currently take care of the 'official' Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi
website at --

I also restore the photographs of Bhagavan.

Information on all of these matters can be found on the pages.

Graham
