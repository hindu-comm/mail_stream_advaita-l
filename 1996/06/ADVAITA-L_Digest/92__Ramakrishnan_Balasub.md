Very good assessment indeed! I don't think I can add anything more to it. I
will however add a small observation here. The practice of people imitating
jnanis seems to have been the case always. I have  read about such incidents
in the "Talks with Ramana Maharshi". I also read "Mud and water", conversations
with Bassui, in which Bassui explicitly warns against people imitating masters
and how it had become very common. This was in the 12th century! So that
should tell us something.
