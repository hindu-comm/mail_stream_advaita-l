The idea that there are ajnanis at all is based on a false perception.
Everyone experiences, in every moment in time, the Self Itself.  Its only
our thoughts that trick us into distortions and pathologies.  Yet the fact
remains that such *apparent* ignorance only thrives as long as we fail to
question its authority.  As soon as we trace thought-maya to its source,
how can we possibly sanction its ploy?

These daily hypnotisms can only be broken by a steady discipline of self
interrogation.  The strategy is simple.  In fact, part of the habit we've
developed, as a consequence of the Mind's hypnotic hold on us, is to spin
more and more clever theses and antitheses--that really accomplish nothing
more than a trip in endless circles.  Eventually the hub will be
contemplated; which is the home of simplicity itself; which directs the
ego to trace its source.  Nothing more or less is required.

Namaste.

I just rented this film because of several recommendations.

I must say that I was disappointed.

It was 95% " trials and tribulations of strange new kid on the block " and 5%
spiritual philosophy.

In the middle of the film, the protagonist spits out a minute's worth of
Advaita Vedanta, but nothing in the film indicates that he ever did anything
to live his life in accordance with those principles.

Some of the Einstein quotes were interesting, but they could have just posted
them to a newsgroup and saved millions of dollars.

My reaction is that average Joe will say " how heartwarming and thought
provoking " after seeing the film, and then go back to living his life exactly
the way his was living before.....


Namaskar,

"The ego arises from the mistaken notion that the light of consciousness
reflected in the intellect and coloured by objectively perceived phenomena
is the true nature of the Self.  Thus, the personal ego falsely identifies
the Self with that which is not the Self and vice versa." - Mark Dyczkowski
