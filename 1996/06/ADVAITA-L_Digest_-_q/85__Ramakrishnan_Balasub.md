Here's where gauDapaada disagrees with Nagarjuna. gauDapaada says that no one
can deny that he exists. This is certainly pratyaksha (self evident). So the
view that one exists is certainly evident.

Then what is it that shunyata is a provisionary name for? Even to perceive any
thing, including the emptiness, there must be an observer. Further, the last
statement "he who holds ..." can be interpreted in the sense that, asserting so
is itself an absolutist position.

Radhakrishnan got many things wrong, including the gauDapaada kaarikaa, which
he dismisses as an impractical and inconsistent philosophy.

>Nagarjuna is the "negator par excellence" :-). He's not merely an agnostic.

That is all fine, but there must be some one to negate, else there can be no
negation. There is no escape from this. That cannot be negated. This is exactly
where gauDapaada and nagarjuna seem to diverge. I haven't read nagarjuna's
works to make a postive statement about this. Do you know what nagarjuna says
shunyata is a provisionary term for?

Actually, I find that Zen Buddhism escaped this shunuyata arguments, atleast
some of the masters like Bassui. Their arguments seem more directed towards
self-realization.

Ramakrishnan.
