Thanks to Vidya for his informative post on Buddhism (in reply to my post).

Isn't that itself a view, I mean "don't have a view to cling to"?

Here you again. How do you know that the seen object does not exist? All you
can say is that the seen object has no reality apart from you, i.e., there is
no way of distinguishing objects seen "outside" and "inside" (waking and
dream). This is the only way we can say "jagat mithya", i.e., ascribing a
special reality to the world, apart from you, is "mithya". A seer is certainly
meaningful, since there must be someone to deny the "seen", otherwise you get
into a contradiction. Can anybody deny that he exists? No, not without getting
into a logical contradiction. Think about it.

So is there anything _not_ empty?

I should point out here that gauDapaada also says that what is accepted by the
vedas and what is also deduced by reason is alone correct. Thus, he declares
statements about creation as illustrations for novices.

I can't follow what you are trying to say :-).

So what is enlightenment according to Nagarjuna? Advaita is quite clear about
what it is.

I can give another example:

A man was talking about shunya, and how everything is shunya etc. The Zen
master whacks him on his head with a pipe. The man gets angry and the master
observes, "If every thing is empty, where did the anger come from?".

Clearly, a pointer to "realize" the self.

> But the idea is to break away from formal language. Hence Nagarjuna is often

I don't think so. For a few ripe people enlightenment appear in strange ways.
A person who is almost ready may be awakened by some weird statement, a clap, or
a whack on the head (all from various Zen stories). One can break away from
formal language only when "realized".

The last statement above is according to masters, who I have
faith in, and certainly not by experience. So breaking away from formal
language is quite an impossibility and indulging in such a thing by making
weird statements for any question, serves no purpose other than, maybe some
gratification.
