        The 1,2,3 are just differentiating between sanchita, prarabdha and
agami karma, I suppose.

        While I understand what you are trying to explain, here is what
Ramana Maharshi says (page 422 of Talks):

The scriptures say that jnana is the fire which burns away all karma
(sarvakarmani). Sarva (all) is interpreted in two way : (1) to include
prarabhda
(2) to exclude it. In the first way : if a man with three wives dies, it
is asked, "Can two of them be called widows and the third not?" All are
widows. So it is with prarabdha, agami and sanchita. When there is no
karta none of them can hold out any longer.

        The second explanation is, however, given only to satisfy the
enquirer. It is said that all karma is burnt away leaving prarabdha
alone. The body is said to continue in the functions for which it has
taken birth. That is prarabdha. But from the jnani's point of view, there
is only Self which manifests in such variety. There is no body or karma
apart from Self, so that the actions don't affect him.

        I think you gave me the second explanation to satisfy the
enquirer :-)

        Thank you for your explanation. Guess there are no other theories
:-) from major schools since other major schools (like dvaita etc) reject
jivanmuktha.

Namaste.
