I like the view of Gaudapada that Creation et al is for beginners. My
friend back at IIT madras, said the same thing in different words. He
used the word Kids, instead of beginners.

In yaksha prashna, the anwer to question "what is the way?", says that
shrutis contradict each other, not one rishi of the past agree with
other and so on. Finally it concludes the best way is to follow the
steps of a Self-realized man. ( later I will try to quote the text
verbatim).
