 Yes thats true.  He says he wanted to learn Truth of vendanta and so asked
Mother to teach him for that reason Nangta or Totapuri came.  He was a
vedantist of high order.  What he took forty years to learn Sri ramakrishna
reached that state within three days.  But that was the not the only reason
for Nangta to come to Sri Ramakrishna.  He was to learn that God is also has
form. This is the Truth which Mother Kali wanted Totapuri to learn hence She
sent Him to Sri Ramakrishna.
 He stayed for More than One year with Sri Ramakrishna to learn this.  He
never stayed anywhere that long because he belonged to a group that always
used to move idea being that One should not be attached to a place of
stay.
        So truly speaking there is Guru relationship in from sides.
Anyway speaking of Guru One King Janaka was approached by Suka for learning
knowledge of Indivisible Brahman.  Then king Janaka asked him to pay
him the fees for teaching.  Then Suka replied why he was asking him for the
fees before he was taught.  Janaka replied that the relation between
Guru and Sishya will not exist once you attain Brahma Jnana.

        I was only mentioning my choice not marking them seperate.

Your right is to work only, but never to the fruit thereof. Nor let your
 attachment for the fruits of your action lead you to inaction.
