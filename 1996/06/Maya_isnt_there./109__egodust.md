There is no greater deceiver than the Mind.
This is obvious.
What isn't so obvious is the unfathomable
depths of its deception!

For example, this very observation,
in of itself, is deception!

In fact, this is the very kind
of observation that advaita
is attempting to diffuse.

To even assert Mind
is a dvaitic trick.

This is where the divine weapon
nan yar is effectively deployed.

Because no other device can so
quickly and thoroughly expose
Mind for what it is: some phantom...

(phantom because when it's
sought, it reveals naught!)

...On the advaitic contrary:

All there is is Truth.
The Truth cannot not be expressed.

All there is is Brahman.
Brahman cannot not be expressed.

Even Maya or the idea that Brahman is
Somehow not being expressed,
Is equally utterly Brahman.
