Not necessarily. The followers debated with brahminical schools which held
that there is something called the soul, and there is something called god.
Besides, Buddha's famous silence can cut both ways. A buddhist school which
started off with the four noble truths of Buddhism would still end up
having to discuss soul, god and karma, if only to deny any ultimate reality
to a soul.
