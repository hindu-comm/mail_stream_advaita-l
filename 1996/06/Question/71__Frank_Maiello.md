This hits the philosophical nerve, raw and direct.  I always regarded the
Buddhist way as an uncompromising assault on the judgemental Mind.  Which is
why, from the start, Buddha was *silent* when questioned about the soul or God.
The subsequent Madhyamika school's professed denials don't necessarily imply
that the 'ultimate condition of What IS' is literally shunyata in the classical
definition of the word.  Their attitude was adopted as a means to neutralize
the typical force of the Mind's insistence to judge, categorize and suffer.

Also: Nirvana, by definition, alludes to the flame of the ego-Mind having
been extinguished.  Any "denial that there can be such a substratum reality
(Brahman)" doesn't imply that at the foundation of Being lies a void; neither
should any Buddhist [including a Zen] translate such an idea to embrace the
experiential ultimatum of a void.  Only in an abstract intellectual sense can
such a condition theoretically exist.  A wave of samadhi will expose what's
what.  The idea that we might call it the absolute or not, is meaningless.

So does ajata advaita!  [Theistic] Isvara is merely a temporal component in
the [impossible] kriyashakti outbreath of Brahman [which, in turn, is beyond
theism, atheism and agnosticism].

Can the eye see the eye?  The real 'I' is itself jnanadrsthi, manifesting as
jnanabhavana.  Its very awareness-essence is the continuum of ananda.  Doing
life time without inquiry we get sucked into myriad confusions/delusions...on
the other hand, if we question the source of the nonsense, we discover the
unknowable we ever are: beyond the comedy of judgements.

praNaam.
