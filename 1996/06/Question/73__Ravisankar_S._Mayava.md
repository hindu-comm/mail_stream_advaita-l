Before reading these interesting discussions, I used to think that
Buddhism's 0 is same as Advaitam's 1. I guess I am wrong.

If Buddha was silent about questions on soul and god, how did his
followers expound lot philosophy on these topics still under the banner
of buddhism.  Is it not a distortion?
