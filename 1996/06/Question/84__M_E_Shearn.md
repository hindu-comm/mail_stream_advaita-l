How adamant?! Who judges the children as not being a virtuoso? Intelectual
adults, Like us? Do we really *think* to add to the words spoken of by Sri
Krshna, Dattatreya, Sri Nisargadatta,  Sri Sankara, Sri Ramakrishna, Sri
Ramana Maharshi, Sidartha Guatma, Jeshua Ben Joseph, the Scriptures  etc.?
If we are not really Jnanis (albeit theoretically being ones) should not we
humbly and quickly find a Jnani to help confer Real Knowledge to us? Will
discussion while being ignorant of ignorance, reveal the Self? Or do we
further our suffering through satsang with the suffering? Has there ever
been group discussion, leading to group Self-realization? If *That* is not
the goal, what good are all the information, thoughtfullness, concepts, and
ideas?
please? From here, Knowledge is the only Reason, for any thing, to be, now.
