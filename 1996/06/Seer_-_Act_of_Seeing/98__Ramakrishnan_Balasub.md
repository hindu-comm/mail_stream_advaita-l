I don't know what you mean by "the act of seeing being an illusion". Something
like seeing something in a dream and waking up and then thinking that the act
of seeing itself was an illusion? Even then there needs to be a "seer", to
negate.

Correct. Realization of illusion happens only due to a "higher level"
knowledge. In order to negate anything, there _has_ to be an observer who
cannot be negated. Otherwise you get into a contradiction.

Correct. I have read about these things also.
