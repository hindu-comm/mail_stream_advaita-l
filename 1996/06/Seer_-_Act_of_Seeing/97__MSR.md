        But what will be the case if the act of seeing itself is an
illusion?  Will that negate both seer and the seen?

        Ramakrishnan's examples ( mirage etc) indicated clearly that
we have to negate the reality of the appearance with a higher level
knowledge which is based on understanding. May be we should similarly
learn to negate the reality of perception in the waking state through
intuive knowledge of the self.


\aside-1

        Even in the vyaavahaarika reality, what we think as we see is
very different from what we see. Mind does a lot of trick inbetween
and creates beauty out of signals our eye receive. When we think we
are seeing something outside, actually we are seeing something inside
the mind. I saw a cassette on brain, few years back. The cassette was
explaining the miracles that happen in inside which is not generally
known to lay men.
