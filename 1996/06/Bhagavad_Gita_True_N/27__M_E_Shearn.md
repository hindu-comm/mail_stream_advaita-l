>TRUTH is buried in our True Nature and there are no ILLUSIONS.

What then is this ego?

>EGO is the root of Creation which destroys the True Nature.

Can the True be destroyed?

>Illusion is the Result of the Action.
>Illusion pervades mind, body and intelligence.
>Illusion generates darkness that shadows the LIGHT.
>Illusion emits Selfishness and promotes HATE.
>Truth is always the TRUTH and Illusion is always an ILLUSION.

There is illusion then?

What is That,
thou art?
I alone am Real,
Being-
Consciousness.
Only True
now, here
in Him.
Loud words
and Large
letters
I am not.
Ever
Subtle upholding body,
Silent upholding word,
Stillness upholding mind.
Om Shanti.
ej
in Him
love
