>>TRUTH is buried in our True Nature and there are no ILLUSIONS.

       What then is this ego?

>>EGO is the root of Creation which destroys the True Nature.

       Can the True be destroyed?

>>Illusion is the Result of the Action.
>>Illusion pervades mind, body and intelligence.
>>Illusion generates darkness that shadows the LIGHT.
>>Illusion emits Selfishness and promotes HATE.
>>Truth is always the TRUTH and Illusion is always an ILLUSION.

                    What is That,
                     thou art?
                      I alone am Real,

                           in Him.
                            Loud words
                             and Large
                              letters are
                               for the mind
                                I am ever
                                 Subtle upholding body,
                                  Silent upholding word,
                                   Stillness upholding mind.
                                       Om Shanti.
