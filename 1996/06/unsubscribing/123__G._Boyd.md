Well, I've tried every possible combination to get off this list but
nothing works.

I subscribed using my full name Graham Boyd, but it won't accept it to
leave the list -- I hope this is only a glitch; the last thing I want to come
home to after 7 weeks away, is thousands of messages.

So whoever looks after the listserver, can you please sort this out.

Graham
