Namaste:

The conversation with Ramana is very enlighting.  The questioner should have
asked one more last question.
Sir why did you remain celibate?  Wonder what his answer would be.

Many of the saints in the past and present are celibate.   I will provide a
few examples:
PAST: Ramana, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Saibaba
PRESENT: Ammachi, Satya Saibaba, Mother Meera, Karunamayi.. list goes on and
on.

We should pay more attention to the life histories than their sayings.

Regards
