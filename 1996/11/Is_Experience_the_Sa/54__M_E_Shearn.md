only if thought to be in the mind,
Can the Self admit of any qualities?

Can the Self, which is unalloyed Being-Consciousness contain such 'things'
as 'you' or illusion?


>If it is TRULY real, it can never "appear" or "disappear".


The tenth man was always present, but not always known.
When the tenth man was found, the missing man was not.

Are our ideas of realization Self limiting?

Of course discusion is ultimately pointless
being the only answer is beyond all words
energy would be better given to inquirey.
for in Silence the Guru is heard

'I' can only be an ignorant fool
