>Is Knowledge other than the Self?

Nothing stands in opposition to the SELF.

>If there is loss of individuality and loss of identification with the body,
>who would be left to be aware of being afraid?

A great question   Who, indeed?

>If there is fear can there be anything but illusion and ignorance?
>Doesn't Jnana obliterate ignorance, like the light removes dark?
>Can the snake and the rope be known simultaneously?

However, the snake-like qualities of the rope will not disappear with the
realization that it's only a rope just like the mirage of a lake in the
desert  will continue to look like a real lake even after you've realized
that it's only a mirage. When you see things as they TRULY are, (i.e. only
the SELF)  you  won't be "hooked"  anymore by your attachment to (and/or
interpretations of) such divisive illusions.
