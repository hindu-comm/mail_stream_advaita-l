>>>Are our ideas of realization Self limiting?

>>The SELF has no ideas "about" ITself.
>>Since there is nothing to realize, the SELF realizes nothing.

>Does the Self say so or does the mind?

     There are not two things here.  There is only the Self and it stands in
oppostion to nothing.

>Is speculation ignorance?

Only if "you" are attached to either your speculation or your ignorance.
After all, "you" are not really "present" anyway.   Only the Self is "present."
