EJ, if you're suggesting that sensations aren't the basic elements of
knowledge, but theoretical reflections (especially of some third party, like
Shankara) are, then we disagree.  Still, you may have a point. It seems to me
that intellect, confounded by knowledge (memory, imagination, reflection) is
samsara.  In other words, samsara is an interpretation of the same sensations
that are also nirvana.

I hope you'll explain what you're saying very clearly so we can talk about
it.

Respectfully
