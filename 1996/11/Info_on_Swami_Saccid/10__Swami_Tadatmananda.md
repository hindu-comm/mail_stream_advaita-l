Are there any disciples of Swami Saccidanandendra (of Holinarsipur, near
Mysore) teaching in North America or any groups here in which his
teachings are studied?

A student here, Martha Chhabra, is doing her PhD dissertation on his
works and would like to know of any local contacts.

Many thanks,
Tadatmananda
