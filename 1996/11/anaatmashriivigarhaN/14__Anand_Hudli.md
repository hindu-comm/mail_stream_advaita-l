Here is one more verse from anaatmashriivigarhaNa (the censure of the
wealth of the non-self) attributed to Shankara:

keyuuraadyairbhuushhito vaa tataH kiM
kausheyaadyairaavR^ito vaa tataH kiM  |
tR^ipto mR^ishhTaannaadinaa vaa tataH kiM
yena svaatmaa naiva saakshhaatkR^ito .abhuut.h ||


keyuuraadyairbhuushhitaH vaa  - bracelets and other ornaments may have
                                adorned (the body)
tataH kiM - what thence
kausheyaadyairaavR^ito vaa -  nice garments may have been worn
tataH kiM - what thence
tR^ipto mR^ishhTaannaadinaa vaa - well cooked rice and other
                                foodstuffs may have been eaten to
                                one's satisfaction
tataH kiM - what thence
yena svaatmaa - by which his own Self
naiva saakshaatkR^ito abhuut.h - has not been directly experienced


Translation:

   Bracelets and other ornaments may have adorned the body. What thence?
   Nice garments may have been worn. What thence?
   Well cooked rice and other food may have been eaten to one's
   satisfaction. What thence?
   (From these) the direct realization of the own Self has not happened!

Anand
