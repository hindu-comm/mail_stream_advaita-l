labdhaa vidyaa raajamaanyaa tataH kiM
praaptaa saMpat.h praabhavaaDhyaa tataH kiM |
bhuktaa naarii sundaraaN^gii tataH kiM
yena svaatmaa naiva saakshhaatkR^ito .abhuut.h ||

labdhaa vidyaa - education has been earned
raajamaanyaa - (which is) respected by kings
tataH kiM  - what thence?
praaptaa saMpat.h - wealth has been obtained
praabhavaaDhyaa - accompanied by authority
tataH kiM - what thence
bhuktaa naarii - the woman has been enjoyed
sundaraaN^gii - beautiful
tataH kiM - what thence
yena svaatmaa - by which his own Self
naiva saakshaatkR^ito abhuut.h - has not been directly experienced

 Translation:

    Education worthy of respect from kings has been earned. What thence?
    Wealth accompanied by authority has been obtained. What thence?
    A beautiful woman has been enjoyed. What thence?
    (From these) the direct realization of the own Self has not happened!


Anand
