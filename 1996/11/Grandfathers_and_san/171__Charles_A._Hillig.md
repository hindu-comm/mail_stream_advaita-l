     I agree with you that the grandfather was attached.

      But (for the sake of discussion)  maybe  the grandfather was showing
this attachment  by saying "no, no" and then by returning to his house than
he was with  his sentence "I am never going to leave you."

     While Maharshi lay on his deathbed and the people in the courtyard were
crying for him to not leave them, I think he said something like  "I'm not
going anywhere.  Where could I go?"

                                          With Blessings,
                                                Chuck Hillig
