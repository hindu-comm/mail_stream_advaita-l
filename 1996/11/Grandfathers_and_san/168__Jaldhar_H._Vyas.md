I thought we just spent a few days concluding they are mutually exclusive.

The fallacy here is assuming karma is a unitary thing.  Actually there is
a whole range of behavior.  The miniscule amount of action that the
sannyasi has to perform in order to stay alive in no way compares to the
action of loving a grandson.

No this is renunciation of karmaphala.  Which is also neccessary but as
many quotes over the past few days have demonstrated Shankaracharya
requires renunciation of karma itself.

Agreed, so the answer to Anands question given the facts of the situation
is no, the grandfather is not being honest.

If he is worried about hurting the child, he is not detached and hasn't
even renounced karmaphala.

Vairagya admits to no needs.  Did Arjuna weigh the needs of Bhishma or
Drona?

That's a pretty big advantage.

Interestingly a view has been mentioned on this list that only those who
have the requisite prarabdtha karma end up taking sannyas.  How do you
square this with the view expressed above?
