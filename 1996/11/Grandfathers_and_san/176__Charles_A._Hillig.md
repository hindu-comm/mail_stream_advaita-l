Dear Joshi,

It's very EASY to remember what Maharshi is.
It's harder for me to remember, though, that I am also the same....the Self.

Why the tears in his eyes during those lst moments?  Well, who can really say?

I suspect that maybe they were a spontaneous overflowing of the infinite
love and the profound compassion that the Self  had (and has) for Itself.

                           With Blessings,
                                     Chuck Hillig
