Namaste Vidya,

I would say the grandfather left the house with such an intense renunciation
that in between his stepping out of the door and hearing the child's cry,
he bacame Wise ! He Realized !
And now having realized, he just comes back, and with full knowledge, says to
 the child:
'O my dear, Don't cry,  I am never going to leave you'.
And that is what Chuck calls it as 100% renunciation at the same time 100%
 involvement.
Our grandfather is now one such !

Celibacy is definitely encouraged by most great teachers and gurus.

However, it is quite difficult in the modern world.

In the 1950's, perhaps it was not difficult to live in the world and
remain celibate, but in the 90's, one's living conditions must be
equivalent to a monastery because all of the media are full of images
of sexuality, so one must essentially disconnect from that and also
from general society where people are always talking about it,
dressing scantily, etc.

Thus what one ends up setting up for oneself, in order to be celibate,
is equivalent to a monastery, so one might as well go to a real
monastery (or an ashram).

My own personal experience is that I've made some attempts to be
celibate for awhile at home, but it didn't really work out.   Whereas
when I stay at an ashram, it is not a problem because it is setup to
facilitate that.


Namaskar,

Ken
