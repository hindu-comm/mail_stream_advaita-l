"No sort of work is a hindrance on the spiritual path. It is the notion 'I
am the doer' that is the hindrance. If you get rid of that by enquiring
and finding out who is this 'I', then work will be no hindrance since you
will be doing it without the ego sense that you are the doer and without
any attachment to the fruits of your work. Work will go on even more
efficiently than before; but you can always be in your own, natural,
permanent state of peace and bliss. Further, one should not worry about
whether one should engage in work or give it up. If work is what is
ordained for one, one will not escape it, however much one may try. On the
other hand, if no work is ordained for one, one will not obtain work
however much one wishes to strive for it."      Ramana Maharshi.
