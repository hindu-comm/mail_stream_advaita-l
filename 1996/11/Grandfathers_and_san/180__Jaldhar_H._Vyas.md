That's a shame.  Vedanta is dialog (Mimamsa.)  Even with one's Guru
analysis and reflection is required not blind obedience.  Intellect may be
limited but unfortunately it's all we have for apprehending the truth.  So
I would encourage you to get into a dialogue more often.

Bhakti depends on attachment to Ishwar whether it is Shiva Bhagavan or
Vishnu Bhagavan or whoever.  Earlier a poster asked what was wrong with
that.  After all Ishwar is hardly the same as a rock or a tree.  I
acknowledge this but Ishwar (or Saguna Brahman) does share with rocks and
trees the characteristic of being an illusion.  Jnana means the shedding of
all maya.  I understand the great Swami Madhusudana Saraswati felt that
Jnana and Bhakti could be reconciled.  I recently aquired an allegorical
play of his called Krishnakautuhalam which I understand goes into this.
I'll revise my opinion if I learn anything new from this.

Arjuna is a perfect example.  The Mahabharata clearly says that Arjuna and
the other Pandavas went to hell for their sins.  If Krishna Bhagavans own
companion was unable to avoid the effects of karma what chance does anyone
else have!

Karma produces other karma.  Just denying responsibility for your own does
not help if you keep on producing more.  That's why all karma is to be
avoided.

I don't know enough about Ramana to know whether he belongs in that
category but the teachings of most of these modern gurus are of doubtful
validity.  I'd prefer quotes from teachers in Shankaracharyas parampara.

Are you referring to performing his mothers Shraddha?  This is indeed
problematic.  However his writings and those of successors do not approve
of this.  Perhaps it was a moment of weakness.  Even the best of human
beings can have flaws.

There are several things wrong with this.

1. The writings of the acharyas of Advaita (indeed all Vedantins) are full
of criticism and polemics against rival schools including ostensibly astika
ones like Samkhya or Nyaya.  This is hardly a sign of inclusion.

2. Buddha was not a Hindu as Hinduism as a concept didn't exist at that
time.

3. Buddha and his followers do not accept the validity of the Vedas.
Vedanta bases itself squarely on the Vedas.

4. Buddha is accepted by all Astikas as an avatara of Vishnu Bhagawan as
this is the testimony of the shastras but if you look at the actual story,
the mission of this avatar was to trick the asuras into giving up Dharma.
This isn't very complimentary to Buddhism is it?  The attitude of the
Astika tradition to Buddhism is quite negative.  When for instance Madhva
is referring to Advaitins as pracchanna bauddha, you can rest assured he is
not trying to pay us a compliment.

Not being able to psychically determine his intent that was the only way I

You have.
