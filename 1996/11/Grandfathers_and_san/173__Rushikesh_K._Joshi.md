Namaskaar,

I am reminded of a tradition which says it is unauspicious if someone
stops you and asks you 'where are you going' when you are just about
to go out of your house on a special task !

Now in this case, the grandchild aksed grandfather the same question.
And thus having started on such an auspicious moment, grandfather's mission
failed and he found himself back home !

So what's the lesson ?
"If you are about to renounce, better see that Panchaang hanging on the
wall and look for an auspicious day !"



Raam Raam.
