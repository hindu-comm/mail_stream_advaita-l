Shri Ramana is a knowledgeable person. He has recognized that Brahman
and I are one and the same. Once that recognition is made, the Self can
discard the body. But in Shri Ramana's case, for the good of the world,
the physical body is kept as an attachment to the Self.

The body of Shri Ramana, attached to the Self, went through the various
physical ailments, surgeries, and expressed the human responses like any
other human body. The difference is that Shri Ramana did not have any
attachment to the body, and the body is a third person.

When Shri Ramana answered "Where can I go ?", it is the Self answering.
When the eyes shed tears, it is the body's response.

I think the response is quite natural.
