Thanks Chuck.   Do you really believe One can have 100% renounciation and
100% attachment.  One has to be a split personality to be like that.   I will
accept if you give one example from past or present.   Do not mention Janaka
Maharaj or some such people who are nothing but characters in a epic.

Regards
                                                                   Nagy
