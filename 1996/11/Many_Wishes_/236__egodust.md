O Arunachala Siva!
Thine eternal living impulse
merely causelessly radiating
every sruti-note of Now--
What flawless transcendence
beyond Polarity's preponderance
of mind reigns in thy gentle
natural power in the Heart
of ALL!

Thou art That I AM! *ever*
present in all prakrit
round the world round the
jiva round isvara within
turyiatika the mownananda.

OM NAMO BHAGAVATE SRI RAMANAYAM!
OM NAMO BHAGAVATE SRI SKANDA!
OM NAMO BHAGAVATE SRI DAKSHINAMURTI!

****

namaskaaram.
