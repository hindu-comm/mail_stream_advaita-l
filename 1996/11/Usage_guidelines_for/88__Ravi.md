Dear Friends,

      My name is Navneet Bhushan. I am a computer scientist working in
Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), India. Presently, I
am doing my MTech at Indian Institute Of Technology, Madras, India.

    As such, I have very little exposure to Advaita. I am willing to
listen and be part of this wonderful forum. I am introduced to this forum
by my Uncle Mr. Arvind Kumar.

   I am looking fwd to find out answers to questions such as

" Why do I exist? Or for that matter, Why does this Universe exist".

These questions have troubled me through out my life ( I am nearing 30
yrs).


  Looking fwd to more interesting talks in cyberspace

with regards to you all,

Navneet Bhushan.

Could you please provide some specific quotes from Shankara on this
subject?

I hear this type of dangerous comment quite often, and find it hard to
believe that Shankara was really proposing it in quite such a way as
this.

The reason it is dangerous, is because it is totally circular and
totally relative.   Two example will suffice to make clear what I am
saying:

1) Some Vaishnavas on the net say that Shankara was actually a
dvaitistic worshipper of Vishnu, based on a single bhakti tract that
he wrote, and that all the advaitistic writings were merely for the
less advanced people who couldn't understand devotion.

2) A Buddhist on the net once argued that all the statements that
Ramana Maharshi had made that contained any Hindu content, including
references to Shankara, were made merely to be nice to all the Hindus
who came to see him, but in reality, he was really a Buddhist !  :-)


Namaskar,

Ken
