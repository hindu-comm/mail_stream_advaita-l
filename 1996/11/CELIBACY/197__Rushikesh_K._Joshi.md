Namaskaar,

We often see the saints as Celebates. But is it that they
wanted to be celebates ? Celebacy is natural in their case.
And it is a consequence of Knowledge. An outward
sign of Brahmnishtha. The word is 'BrahmaNishtha', and not 'celebacy'.
It sounds very odd to me to call the Jnani saints as celebates.

However, in the Yogasutraas, celebacy is one of the
Anga among others. But no saint advices everybody
to become celebate. The Guru knows what is good for
the desciple. It is just that one could be in
his 10th standard and the other in his 5th standard.

And saints also have to be born.
Depending on the state of the parents, appropriate
children are born to them.
Laws of Karma do work.

So do not also underestimate the Grihasthaashrama at the same time.
It is the base Ashrama for mankind's evolution towards Knowledge !!

A Jnani saint born to you could effortlessly give you
realization.
