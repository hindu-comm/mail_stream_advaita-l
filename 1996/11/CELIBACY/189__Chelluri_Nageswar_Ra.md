                                     SRI MATRENAMAH
NAMASKARAMS!

IT IS MY BELIEF THAT CELIBACY IS ESSENTIAL ON SPIRITUAL PATH.
Please note the following 'cause they are the basis of my belief.
This is Kaliyuga, pradhama padam.  People like Ramana and Ramakrishna who are
celibate appear for a purpose.  People putup "Bahukruta Veshas" for a
livelyhood.

I do not believe people who are sexually active, have large families would
ever become saints.    Having said that I would like present a scenerio.

There are several unemployd Ph.D's in this world (Its unfortunate) who do
anything to maintain their families.  Nothing wrong with what they do.  Think
of a PH.D or a non Ph.D just a smart fellow reads a lot and gets himself
equipped with tremendous knowledge of Advaita, Dwita etc. etc.   Now all he
has to do present himself as a jeevanmukta, gather a few RICH Indian,
American, Australian and European followers and establish his own school,
write a few books and enjoy the material benefits the disciples bring in for
his enjoyment.  He has family enjoying the fruits of his efforts. They will
never travel unless it is  first class. Ordinary people like me who are
gullible
 believe he  really is a Jeevanmukta.

Now can anyone tellme how I am supposed to differentiate the real from
unreal, unless I take pains to find out his past.

Maybe some of you are right who advocate married and having family does not
disqualify them from the ranks of jeevanmuktas.   That's your right.
 Afterall this is a free world.

Regards
