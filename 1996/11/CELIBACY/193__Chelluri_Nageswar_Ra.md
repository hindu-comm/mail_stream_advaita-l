Sri Joshi says "We see saints as Celebates. Do they want to be? Its a natural
Phenomena".
Nobody ever asked a saint why they are celebate.  Instead of second guessing
and interpreting to justify our point of view.  We should get the answer
straight from the saint.    Well I asked a living saint and she said she
wanted to be celibate by choice.That is essential in spiritual path.
