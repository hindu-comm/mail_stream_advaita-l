Dear Nagy,

     Aren't "renunciation" and "attachment" quite incompatible?

      I wasn't speaking of "attachment" but of  NON-attachment.  I was
thinking that one could be 100% involved with and fully participatory in
"doing his duty" and yet remain 100% detached from the results of any of his
efforts.

     Since such detachment would be totally grounded in love and compassion,
it would, of course, be very different than "indifference."

                              With Blessings,
                                     Chuck Hillig
