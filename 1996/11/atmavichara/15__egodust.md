                           "Who am I?"

..........tears through the fallacies of mindworks like lightning
the time-stopper result is unmentionable the universal causal
denominator is from the inside lived as it ever always and forever
quite IS and there's only some imagined protest hallucination because
some residual momentum leaving trails of doubts out of ancient habit.

No cause for the diversion of That natural attention except by funny
dramatic-trick inhering in pure consciousness--which isn't possible!

Therefore advaita gets successfully transcended and herein discarded
in the name of That which beats the spirit Heart in the perfect NOW.

No complications left on the radiant battlefield...rather, I'm ONLY

                             THAT IAM.
