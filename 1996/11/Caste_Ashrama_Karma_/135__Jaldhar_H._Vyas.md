Here refers to samsara.  The Mumuksha doesn't wish to be bound to samsara.
He desires liberation because it is the truth not because it is good.

Both.

Yes.  And Krishna Bhagavan convinces him that although this karma is a sin,
abandoning his dharma as a kshatriya is a far bigger sin.

The caste system is always in place.  It may not always be practiced but
its validity does not depend on its popularity.

Yes.

No because there is in the Dharmashastras the category of antyaja or
ashuddha to describe these peoples and certain dharmas are prescribed for
them.  For the most part they are eternally ignorant but at least the
possibility of liberation exists even for them.  Just like anyone else if
they remain in samsara they should follow their allotted duties.  If  they
seek Moksha they should seek it using the prescribed methods.
