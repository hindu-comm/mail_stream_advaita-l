True.

Inquiry of into the rality of the world is useful. Just as the inquiry into
the rality of the snake.

That the snake has two stripes or three stripes, is it poisonous or
non-poisonous, etc. - may not lead us any where.

Vyavahaarika understood as vyaavahaarika is no problem.  If it is taken as
real then the problem starts.

By the by, advaita vedantins use the following as the difinition of the truth:

Trikaala abhadhitam satyam - That which remains the same in three periods
of time is the truth.

Can any one give me reference to this in the Pramaanas.  Vishishtaadvaita
also uses this but they allow the modifications as part of the abhaaditam.
For them Jagat, world, becomes satyam, even if it undergoes continuous
modifications.

Hari Om!
