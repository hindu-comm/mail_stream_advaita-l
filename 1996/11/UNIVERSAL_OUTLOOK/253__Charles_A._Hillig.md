Dear Nagy,

     You ask if they have the power to stop it.

     But stop "what?"

     An truly awakened saint would not experience a separate "it" out there
that must be, seemingly, "stopped."

     For them, the universal peace is already fully present as they abide as
the Self.  There would be nothing for them to "bring" to "others" because
they would not make the slightest distinction between "themselves" and
"others."

     In that place, they would only be the very personification of the
infinite love and compassion that the Self has.....for Itself.

                                 With Blessings,

                                    Chuck Hillig
