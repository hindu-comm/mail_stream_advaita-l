I agree.

     I think that it's this very notion that "progress is possible" that
provides the momentum for the historical-self to, seemingly,  propel its
story "forward" and out into some kind of illusory "future."    But maya  is
only  an entrancing dream and a big part of that dream is that, someday, (if
you play your cards right) you will, eventually "awaken."   Ironically, the
pursuit only reinforces that the seapartion is real and needs to be traversed.

I agree with you

I remember a wonderful quote by Maharshi which speaks to this very issue.

    He said: "There are three classes of spiritual aspirants.  The most
advanced realize the Self as soon as they are told of Its real nature.  They
are like gunpowder igniting with a single spark.

     Those in the second class need to reflect on It for some time before
Self awareness becomes firmly established.  They are like charcoal and so
they need some heat to be applied for a short period of time.

     Those in the third category, however, usually need many years of
intense spiritual practice in order to wake up from their illusions.  They
are like pieces of wet coal that, over a long period of time, first need to
dry out completely before they can eventually begin to heat up enough to
start burning on their own."

     So, maybe it's a combination of both "effort" and Grace.

     As Edgar says in Shakespeare's "King Lear,"
                                            "Ripeness is all."

     The Self is not gained because It is ever-present.

     Only ignorance is lost.

                                  With Blessings,
