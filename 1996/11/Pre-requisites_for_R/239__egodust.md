Doubtless this is one of the most difficult questions to resolve.  One that
plagued me for many years.  Perhaps it's best to assess it in terms of the
vantage point of one's awareness: is there believed to be a separative ego
in existence or not?  If the belief is yes, then effort is also part of this
belief--and *within that mayavic construct*, effort, free will, dharmic
sadhana, etc are all applicable.  Whereas, if/when the belief in ego gets
shattered, effort, free will, etc are also seen as fantacies.

Regardless, it appears the case that each jiva is preordained as to when and
how moksha eventuates.  Nevertheless, the yogamarga--whether one believes
they're choosing to follow it or not--is itself all part of the prefixed
destination.  It has to be admitted, for example, that a satvic mind is an
indispensible prerequisite for a person to be capable of handling moksha.
And such satvic mind has to develop *somehow*.  So the cultivation of
discrimination and detachment are inevitable, and in fact the very effort
put forth [*within* the mayavic construct, mind you!] is *also* a result
of Grace.  As Sankara says, to be born as a human is the result of grace;
to have the desire for liberation is the result of grace.  If we expand on
this theme, each upadhi must be considered the result of arul.

The whole thing is a driving mystery, really.  The more we philosophically
brood on riddles like this, the more entangled we'll get.  It does have its
purpose, though...to a point.  And this is the mind's own merciful device in
its secret plot to burn itself out!
