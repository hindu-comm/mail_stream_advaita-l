Why counter-productive ?
The Geeta gives the SthitaPrajn Lakshanaas.
Why ?

How will you get ready for it ?
To get ready itself is practice.

Worship, Inquiry, Praanaayam are practices.
Sadhana is the word for practice. Do you mean Saadhana is
not required ?


I think you want to separate the practice with its awareness, from
the practice which one may not be aware of it as practice.
Mostly you are talking about the second type.
Surrender, deep devotion and GuruBhakti can be some
examples of the second type.

[ I've quoted the whole message because the thread is not recent. ]

Well, I think you are now talking about areas that are very specific
to the particular individual.

For example, there are probably some married individuals, who, as you
suggest, take the Maharshi's words as reason to prop up their egos and
lose all humility.

However, there are also undoubtedly some individuals who think they
cannot attain Self-Realization while married, and so do not try with
sufficient focus and attention.   I believe that these are the people
whom Maharshi is talking to, when he is quoted above.

Furthermore, there is a third group of individuals, including myself,
who were married prior to encountering Vedanta and Advaita.   In such
a case, there is no question of deciding whether or not one is capable
of being a monk in order to attain Self-Realization, the decision was
already made by one's karma.   Thus, Maharshi's remarks (and similar
remarks by other esteemed sages) are also intended for this third
group of individuals.

Also, statements that it is "not probable" for such individuals to
attain Self-Realization are pointless.   It is mathematically "not
probable" for ANY individual to attain Self-Realization.
Nevertheless, the lack of probability did not prevent any of the sages
and saints of the past from attaining Self-Realization.

On another matter, Ramakrishnan above states:
> This is because even after "realization" one
>can fall again due to vasanas (this has been told by maharshi himself).

[ In private e-mail, Ramakrishnan explained that this refers to pages
89-91 of "Talks with Ramana Maharshi". ]

It is good that you put "realization" in quotes, because this does not
refer to Self-Realization.   It refers to a temporary experience of
the same state.   The temporary nature is due to samskaras that
manifest in the citta.   These samskaras must be removed before the
state can be made permanent.

>From Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi, page 249:

"M: [...] People ask 'How did ignorance (avidya) arise at all?' We
have to say to them: 'Ignorance never arose.  It has no real being.
That which is, is only vidya (knowledge).'

D: Why then do I not realise it?

M: Because of the samskaras. "

And on page 248:

"D: Having heard this truth, why does not one remain content?

M: Because samskaras have not been destroyed.  Unless the samskaras
cease to exist, there will always be doubt and confusion (sandeha,
viparita).  All efforts are directed to destroying doubt and
confusion.  To do so their roots must be cut.  Their roots are the
samskaras.  These are rendered ineffective by practice as prescribed
by the Guru. "

PS  A general question for anyone - towards the bottom of the same
page, page 248, Maharshi uses the word "vasanas" which by context
seems to be used interchangeably with "samskaras".    Is there
actually a subtle difference, or do both words mean the same thing?


Namaskar,

Ken
