  Maayaa Panchaka of Shankara has this to say:

 nirupamanityaniraMshake .apyakhaNDe
 mayi chiti sarvavikalpanaadishuunye |
 ghaTayati jagadiishajiivabhedaM
 tvaghaTitaghaTanaapaTiiyasii maayaa ||


 nirupamanityaniraMshake - in (me who am) incomparable, eternal, without
                           parts,

 apyakhaNDe - also indivisible
 mayi - in me
 chiti - (who am) Consciousness
 sarvavikalpanaadishuunye -  and devoid of all differentiations and the
                             like,
 ghaTayati - makes compatible or possible
 jagadiishajiivabhedaM -  the distinction between the Lord of the world
                          and the individual soul (jiiva)
 tvaghaTitaghaTanaapaTiiyasii maayaa - maayaa  is indeed an expert in
                                        making incompatible things
                                        compatible


 Translation:

    In me who am incomparable, eternal, partless, indivisible,
    Consciousness, and without all differentiations and the like, It (Maayaa)
    makes possible the distinction between the Lord of the world (God) and
    the individual soul (jiiva). Indeed, Maayaa is an expert in making
    incompatible things compatible!

Hello,

I think that "AND" would be better than "OR".

As Ms. Param mentioned, someone could have direct experience of
samadhi without knowing what they were experiencing.   And, someone
could have encyclopedic knowledge of the teachings with no experience.

Certainly a guru should have both.

However, my experience is that, the postings of people who have
precise knowledge of what the great masters said (but have no
experience themselves) are more beneficial than the postings of those
who have had some significant direct experience, but have insufficient
intellectual knowledge.


Namaskar,

Ken
