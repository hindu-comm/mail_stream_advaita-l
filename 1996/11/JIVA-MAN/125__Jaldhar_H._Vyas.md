I thought enough of you to assume it was a paraphrase instead of blindly
assuming you were mistranslating.  Yes, I do consider myself more
thoroughly trained than certain posters (and bow down to those more
thoroughly trained than I) and I don't feel it to be hostile to point that
out that simple fact.  Still, the tone of this conversation does seem to be
getting a little personal so perhaps it is in all our interests to step
back a bit.
