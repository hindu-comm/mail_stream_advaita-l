Instad of speculating as to what is karma and what isn't, why don't you
take a look at the dharmashastras.  What a sannyasi can and cannot do is
clearly delimited therein.

An avatar is an amsha of Bhagavan so their situation is hardly the same as
a normal human being.

Of course we have a sannyasa option in the west.  It may take more effort
and you may not have the willpower to pursue it but that's  your problem
not the Wests.

Our Dharma is refered to as Sanatan or eternal.  It is completely valid in
any place and any time.

True, just being a sannyasi doesn't guarantee Moksha but not being a
Sannyasi guarantees you won't acheive Moksha.

Sounds like the world to me too.  Doesn't sound like Vedanta though.
