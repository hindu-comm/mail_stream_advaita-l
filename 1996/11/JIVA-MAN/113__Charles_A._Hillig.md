My friend,

     You're quite right.

     My message doesn't "exist"
            because "I" am not really "here" to be, so-called,  "wasting
your time."

     And, likewise, YOU are not really "here"
                                                to be having your time "wasted."

      My post doesn't  "mean anything," either.

      (And, of course, it also doesn't "mean anything"
                                                      that it doesn't "mean
anything!")


                                       With Blessings,
                                               Chuck Hillig
