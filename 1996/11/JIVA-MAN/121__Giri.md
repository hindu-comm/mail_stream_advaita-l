Produced below are excerpts from the talk on 29th sep. 1936

D : Can i engage in spiritual practice, even remaining in samsara ?
M: Yes, certainly. One ought to do so.
D : Is not samsara a hindrance ? Do not all holy books advocate
renunciation ?
M: Samsara is only in your mind ....Renunciation is non-identification of
the Self with the non-self. On the disappearance of ignorance the
non-self ceases to exist. That is true renunciation.
D: Why did you then leave your home in your youth ?
M: That is my prarabdha. One's course of conduct in life is determined by
one's prarabdha. My prarabdha in this way. Your prarabdha is this way.
D: Should I not also renounce ?
M: If that had been your prarabdha, the question would not have arisen.

hope of krama-mukti.
