   I think we have been through this discussion already.

  But here goes.

  sasaadhanaM karma sannyasya shariirayaatraamaatracheshhTo yatiH
  jnaananishhTho muchyate |

  Renouncing (sannyasya) all karmas together with their accessories,
  and doing only what is necessary for the bare maintenance of the body,
  the sannyaasii who  steadfastly practises jnaana, gets liberated.

          (Giitaa bhaashhya of Shankara)

 Also,

 ekasya purushhasya jnaanakarmaNoH virodhaat.h yugapadanushhThaanaM
 na sambhavati |

 The same person *cannot* practise jnaana and karma simultaneously, since
 the two are contradictory to each other.

  (G. B.)

  Now, according to classical Vedanta, a householder cannot stop
  doing karma, and yet remain as a householder. The only option is
  to take up sannyaasa. So this logical means that one has to be a
 sannyaasii in order to practice jnaana.

  Again, this is a difficult matter, since later advaitins have
  argued for jiivanmuktas being in the midst of samsaara, performing
  karmas, although without any attachment to those karmas. It seems
  to be safe to assume that it is extremely rare for a person to
  get liberated (mokshha) while engaged in worldly life.


 Anand
