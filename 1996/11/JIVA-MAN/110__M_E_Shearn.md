>There is no claim here, my intense friend, that there is any intelectual
knowledge of Vedanta or smurtis, shastras or any other Eastern way of life
or thought. The teaching of Advaita Vedanta only came after there was an
experience of That and seeing, through That limitless Peace, how foolish the
seeming dramas of good and evil, ignorance and knowledge and life and death
are in comparison to That. Advaita Vedanta validated what was experienced,
and by the Grace of the Guru, which is that experience and the desire to
hold it, through Advaita Vedanta,  He shows me the "path", as if there is
such to what is already one's Self.

>  If Knowledge was abided in by me, there would not be any need for this
discussion! There is no me or any person in That Being. Only this ignorance
brings me into these 'spiritual pissing contests'. I do not claim to be a
jnani. Of course what jnani would? Jnani being only limited veiw from ajnana
of Jnana it Self. There is the attempt however to abide in that Knowledge
which is not seperate of the Self. After tasting That nectar any intention
for any other person, place or thing, any intelectual knowledge or even any
individuality is incredibly insane, to me.

>  You claim that "you" will do this and that, planning "your" life out
according to "your dharma". Whether that is your parahbda or not, one cannot
say, but what I will say is the thought 'I am the body/mind/ego' is the
"knot of the heart" and that which is negated by 'not-this, not-this' in
"your" scriptures. With the thought 'I am the person' comes the thought
'that is the world' and the bondage sealing idea that 'I am the doer'. Isn't
that sowing the seeds of karma, which you so adamently wish to overcome?
