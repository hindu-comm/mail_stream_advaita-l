Namaste MitraaNi!

Please could we keep to examining issues and avoid personal attacks
whether direct or indirect.  I at least would appreciate that gracious
approach to our effort.

 i assume that you are communicating from a ashram or a cave due to your

in such a certain manner would not chose anything but that! Unless of course
he was a fool.
