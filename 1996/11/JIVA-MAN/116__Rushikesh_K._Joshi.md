There is this famous one from MahaaNaaraayan Upnishad:

        Na Karmanaa Na Prajayaa Dhanen, ( Not by Karma etc )
        Tyagenaike ... ( But by Tyaga *ALONE*.. )


Sorry, at the moment I cannot provide you the exact chapter etc


Note:

In jaldhar's statement, the first occurance  "sannyas" means the
formal sannyas diksha. And the second occurance "Sannyasi" means
the real Sannays (mind Sannyas). If these two terms are given
the same meaning, (from any one of the above two), then that statement
will loose its meaning.
