Re: sannyasa

I think people seem to be forgetting that all enlightened persons in the
literature are all grihasthas, not many sannyasins who ran away from their
prescribed duties. There are only a few sannyasins who reached the gnana
state.

We should remember all the sages are all grihasthas, even when they lived
in the forests, and they all reached jnana state.

To take the approach that one has to be a sannyasi to achieve moksha is
taking it to the extreme and that too in the most literal sense.

Mental renunciation, whether he/she lives in the middle of a city with
family, like a hermit in a forest, or like a sannyasi in himalayas, mental
renunciation is the way for jnana. Announcing to the world that he/she
has taken sannyasa does not take anywhere.
