                                ^^^^^^^^^^ jnaana marga, i guess.

        This is reiterated at many places, including the commentaries on
Br. U, as Vyas pointed out. Shankara even notes that only Brahmins are
allowed to become sanyas in his commentary of Br. U.  I think Sureshvara
corrects this in his sambandhavartika.

        Actually, it is so rare that we can only point at exceptions
(Janaka etc) rather the general case. However, as Ramana Maharshi notes
unless it is someone's prarabdha that one take sanyas, it will not
happen. And it is his prarabdha that he take sanyas, then the question
'Should I take sanyas' will not arise. I can get the exact quotes from
'Talks with Ramana' or the newsletter, if needed.
        imho, one should carry out the duties diligently. 'I am already
enlightened' cannot be used as an excuse to escape from duties. Karma-yoga
is a necessary step.
        Since the jnana marga is restricted to a few, isn't the path of
sharangati (surrender) much easier and open to everyone irrespective of
caste, gender etc, according to advaita (and Bhagavad gita) ?

Namaste.
