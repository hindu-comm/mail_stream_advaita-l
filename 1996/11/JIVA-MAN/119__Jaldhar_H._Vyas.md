First of all by a Dharmashastra I meant a work like the Mitakshara which
laids down the rules for the various types of people including Sannyasis.
The Bhagavad Gita is a Mokshashastra.  However let us examine this shloka
and see if it bolsters your claims.

I assume the words below it are a paraphrase.  As a translation they are
so mind-bogglingly bad they could not be anything else but a paraphrase.
(Then again you did mention how lackadaisical your Guru was in teaching
Sanskrit so who knows.)  An accurate translation would be something like
the following:

"Not even for a moment can one stay here without Karma for all the Gunas
of Prakriti force one to act."

The goal of the Mumukshu is not to stay here.  However for one who does
stay here there is no alternative but to perform karma.  Remember it is
initially Arjuna who is arguing for renunciation.  But for completely the
wrong reason.  He is scared to fight.  For such a person Karma is the
prescribed path.  The Mumukshu needs no karma as he is after Brahman which
is beyond the three Gunas.

You're correct that even small karmas are nevertheless karma.  Very well,
I modify my position to allow that jnanis are permitted to breathe :-)
But only small karmas like that and eating and sleeping.  Bigger karmas
(like growing vegetables :-) are still out.  Even in the matter of small
karmas which are neccessary to live you see that sannyasis seek to
eliminate by fasting, control of the breath etc.

> You have a very good point.  Then please can you explain away Janaka?

What is there to explain.  In the Brhadaranyakopanishad he is depicted as
the pupil of Maharshi Yagnavalkya.  It is neccessary and proper for one in
that state to continue performing karma.  Then there are statements like
in the Gita 3.20. karmanaiva hi samsiddhimasthita janakadayah.  "By karma
alone did Janak etc. reach their goal."  This means by Karma alone, only
by the performance of karma not by desire for its fruits, did he and those
like him reach their goal.  The idea is not that renunciation of
karmaphala is enough to achieve Moksha but only that it is a neccessary
step.  Those that didn't even do that much certainly didn't reach their
goal.

Non-sannyasis can certainly talk of Vedanta.  Shri Vachaspati Mishra and
Shri Appaya Dikshit are grhasthas whose works are assidiously studied even
today.  But talking is not the same as doing and no member of
Shankaracharyas parampara would ever say that mere speech about Brahman
was enough for Moksha.

One hardly needs clairvoyant powers, your words are on display for all to
see.  If you truly wish to maintain this untenable proposition, tell me
what is so special about America, what magical powers does the West possess
which prevents Sannyasa.  I'm sceptical because several years ago after my
Yagnopavit I resolved on the advice of our families' Shukla ji that I
would learn a little Sanskrit and live as a Brahman should.  Then also
people said "You can't wear a tilak in America.  We can't wear a dhoti to
work in America etc. ad nauseum."  And I observed that those who spoke
that way hadn't actually bothered to find out if it was true.  They spoke
that away out of laziness or fear of the Whites or whatever.  Yet with
some initial trepidation I tried it and I found out I could do it.  Now I
practice my Dharma with a fidelity my Grandfather couldn't find fault
with.  The point is with effort everything is possible.  If you do not
want to make the effort do not blame external causes only yourself.

The Veda and the shastras that depend on them do not admit of cultural
differences and lifestyle options.  They are clear that deviation
from their tenets is a sin.  Think about it why do the Acharyas expend so
much energy of defeating the Buddhists?  Were they not just "doing their
own thing"?  And Shankaracharya is not troubled in the slightest by the
texts which say women and Shudras are not entitled to study the
Upanishads.  This kind of clash of world views occured before in our
history.  By calling ourselves Vedantins we admit to being of the party of
the narrow-minded.

As for Vedanta flourishing in the West, I see little evidence of this if
some recent posts are anything to go by.  It is easy to see why a
philosophy which carelessly rubber stamps any "lifestyle" or "experience"
its' adherents dream up (and perhaps annoints with a little gibberish)
might become popular though.

On this I should further add Shankaracharya commented on the Bhagavad Gita
which is not just for Sannyasins.  As part of the Mahabharata it is for
all people and is an upaya for those who have no access to the Vedas.

No I don't want to see the illusionary nature.  If I am studying it, it is
in order to transcend it.

If you continue to believe the jnanakarmasamuccayavada is exceptable to
Vedanta then you didn't cover it well enough.
