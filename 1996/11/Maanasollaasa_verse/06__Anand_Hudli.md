svargaadiraajyaM saamraajyaM manute na hi paNDitaH
tadeva tasya saamraajyaM svaaraajyamaatmani  ||

svargaadiraajyaM -  sovereignty over heaven, etc.
saamraajyaM - sovereignty over everything
manute na hi - does not consider
paNDitaH - the wise one
tadeva - only that
tasya - his
saamraajyaM - sovereignty over everything
svaaraajyaM - independence or autonomy
aatmani - with respect to his Self

 The wise one does not consider the sovereignty over heaven and
the like, to be universal Lordship. Independence with respect to his Self
is alone sovereignty over everything for him.


Anand
