Dear Mr. Giri;

Thank you very much for this.  It is indeed a very useful information for me.

Where can I get more information about the above point you have mentioned?
I just wanted to know the reason. That's all.

Oh! My I made a mistake.  Thanks for correcting me.  Three days back
when I was writing this article, Brihadaranyaka upanishad was whirling in
my mind. Rama advised Hanuma to read "maaNDukya". My apologies for the mistake.

Usually, when I write something I send it to my guru Swamini
Saradapriyananda.  She reads the article and sends me her opinion and
corrections.  I am sure she would have corrected me.

This time after writing the article I have posted directly to all of you.
It is said that "if you want to find out the dirt in the gold better
purify it in the fire".  Here my article is being burned in the fire called
Knowledge. How fortunate I am to get education from you. I am glad :-)

The second thing I wanted to convey to the fellow members is that I am
working as a business analyst.  Due to the nature of my job I have to move
accross many countries.  I do not carry books with me.  Probably, I may
take some time to get quotations (with stanza numbers etc.,) but at the
moment I am helpless. I beg all of you to understand my position.

Can you explain further. Thanks.


Earnest regards,
