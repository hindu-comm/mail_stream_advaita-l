There is A third possibility.  That when I say mental renunciation isn't
enough, I don't mean to say just physical renunciation is enough or mental
renunciation is not important.  What I mean to say is for Moksha mental
_and_ physical renunciation is needed.  Commenting on the Ishopanishad
Shankaracharya says "Only a fool will wish to combine the knowledge of the
oneness of the self with work or meditation."
