I think I was trying to put my understanding over the subject.  Not the
point whether they are valid or not valid. Can you show the point I made
on validity!

I ASK YOU AGAIN.. DID I EVER SAY THAT DVAITA AND VISHISTADVAITA PATHS ARE
NOT VALID :-) :-)  Why don't you read my article, or my earlier postings
on this subject, again?...

Don't go there... Till now you are right, sometimes you spoke with out
knowing the subject itself.  Now, you are going to comment Sri Sankaracharya
by saying that he did not understand Jainism and Buddhism... BTW, where is
Jainism come in to picture from?

Please try to understand what you said, above.

Thanks & regards
Madhav
