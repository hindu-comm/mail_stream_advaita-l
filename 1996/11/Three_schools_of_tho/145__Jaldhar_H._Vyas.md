Lengthiness is not neccessarily a bad thing.  Some things cannot be
explained in a few words.

Note this is not neccessarily true.  It is a central tenet of both Purva
and Uttara Mimamsa (Vedanta) that the Vedas are apaurusheya.  Some
thinkers have reconciled this with the idea of Gods revelation saying the
term just means they are not created by people but others maintain even
God cannot be considered author of the Vedas.

This is why the philosophy was reffered to as mimamsa or enquiry.  It
requires employment of the intellect not blind obedience.

The Vedas really have no parts they are one unit of equal authority
throughout.  The division into samhita, Brahmana, Aranyaka, and Upanishad
is in many ways an artificial one.

It is interesting that while accurately identify "Allopanishad" etc. as
fakes, you consider the Vajrasuchi "upanishad" to be real.  As the name
suggests it is Buddhist influenced. Upanishad is also used in the sense of
"hidden" or non-mundane knowledge.  Just because a work is entitled
Upanishad doesn't neccessarily mean it is one.

This is not true of what is termed Hinduism as a whole.  Traditionally
there are supposed to be six main schools but nowadays nearly all of them
are extinct or have been absorbed into one form of Vedanta or another.

It is not true of Vedanta even.  An important omission is the Vaishnava
Vallabha who thinks that the doctrine of maya ruins advaita and is not
neccessary.  Thus he refers to his teachings as Shuddhadvaita or pure
advaita.  Then there is the Gaudiya Vaishnavas best known in the west
through ISKCON whose "philosophy" I can frankly make neither head nor
tails off (and I suspect neither can they.)  There are many others who
have attempted to show their philosophies are in concordance with Vedanta.
