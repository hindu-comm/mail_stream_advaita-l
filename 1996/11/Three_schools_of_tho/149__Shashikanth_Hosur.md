        I have question for you.  If Dwaita and Vishista dwaita schools
of thought do not lead to realization then why did Sri Madvacharya
and Sri Ramujacharja founded this schools of thought.  These people I consider
were fully realised and knew the absolute Truth as well Sri Sankaracharya
knew.  In fact these people came after Sri Sankaracharya and in fact in the
begining were followers of advaita school of tradition.
