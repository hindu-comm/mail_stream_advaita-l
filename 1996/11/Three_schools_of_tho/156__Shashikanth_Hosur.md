Namaskaram
        Thats good.  Then u should not comment upon the validity or
not validity till that time.  It was u who raised the question of
other paths are valid.
I was only trying to figuring on what basis u told it.
>From the earlier part of the reply u said that u did not know and were not
realized.  Then u cannot simply speak about the validity of other paths.
        If u believe in the path of advaita then adhere to it and practise
I believe every path is as valid as any other path.  There are saints in
each path.  In it our narrow mindeness that makes us say this is vaild or not
valid.  Sri Ramanujacharya and Sri Madhvacharya were great souls as was
Sri Shankaracharya.
        It is correct if u say that U have much faith in advaitic teachings
as u are more inclined to it.  But u cannot speak or comment on other
paths if u are not aware of it.
        Quoting Bhagavatgeeta and other upanishads are useless unless if
undestand the inner meaning of each and every word.
        U said that if I showed u cloth u can say wheather it is black or white
U might me color blind too.  So what may appear black to u need not be black.
U should grasp that.
        U mentioned that u should look ones own path.  Good thats correct.
Then why comment other paths. U do not have a slightest insight insight into
them.
        I feel that it is the same reason for which Sri Sankaracharya
went against Buddhism and Jainism.
