        No Advaita if it is a state is a as false as any other state.
Advaita is not a state.  It is beyond the states.  As long as ur are in a
state then its not the Absolute truth.  The absolute is beyond All the
states.  As long as some thing is a state it implicitly carries the notion
of change so it cannot be truth.  So Advaita is beyond states.

        So u mean all the great souls like Annamayya, Tagaraju and all others
did not know God.
        Vishista dwaita school and dwaita school are valid.
        Sri ramakrishna Paramahamsa himself used to state that vishista
dwaita and dwaita schools are also correct.

        Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had his first samadhi experience at
11.  He used to tell his disciples about it.
        Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa wanted to practise all the philosophies
and experience their validity and hence he asked mother Kali to teach him
The bjairavi Brahmani was a tantric guru.  She taught him about tantra.
Sri Totapuri taught him about advaita at the same time he realised that
god also has form which was taught to him by sri Ramkrishna Paramahamsa

        Then Why did Sri Ramanuja and Sri Madhava teach against some of the
advaitic practises.  U answer is not clear.
        It also means that they were not teaching something which they
proclaimed as highest truth.  So that means they were lying ..
