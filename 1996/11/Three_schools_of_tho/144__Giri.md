        The sanskrit text, transliteration and translation of
the vajrasuchi upanishhad can be found at
        ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/private/sanskrit/sanskrit.html

The same site also contains kena, iisha, muktika etc

        Most of the Indology scholars would never accept that the
muktika upanishhad was written/composed during the period of
Rama, which is around 5000 BC (i.e if they even accept that Rama is not a
mythological character).

        ??? In the two books I have,

Lord Rama to Shri Hanuman in muktika:

        'The only means by which the final emancipation is attained is
through maaNDUkya upanishhad alone, which is enough for the salvation for
all aspirants. If GYAna is not attained thereby study the 10 upanishhads;
thou shalt soon attain GYAna, and then My Seat. O son of ajnjanaa, if thy
GYAna is not made firm, practice (study) well the 32 upanishhads. Thou
shalt get release. If thou longest after videhamukti, study the 108
upanishhads. I will truly state in order the (names of the) upanishhads
with their Shaanti (purificatory mantras).'

        Certainly not. Sanatana Dharma does not stand based on three
schools of thought within vedanta. It is based on the primary six
schools of thought (sad-darshana). Though vedanta, and yoga may be the
popular schools among them, they borrow a lot from other schools. Yoga
from samkhya and vedanta from (purva) mimansa.

        Really ? I thought dvaita was more of a servant master relationship
rather than a slave-master relationship. The latter can never be driven
by Love.

        Human reasoning ? Certainly MAdhva employs logic in his
discourses and also accepts the six pramana-s as a means of
knowledge. Or do you mean that the dvaitins on the net never accept
reasoning :-)

        Brahman is beyond reason in any Indian philosophy.

        Naturally, you posted this on the advaita mailing list, because
you won't find many people who will differ from the above contention :-)

        I don't think so. The lineage of Advaita parampara is
Narayana, Brahma, Vasistha ..... Gaudapada, Govinda, Shankara ..
(see tha hastamalaka stotra).

        There are also separate lineages from Dattatreya and Dakshinamurthi.

        Can you provide in which composition of Shankara does he say the
above ?

Namaste
