One could say that those passages themselves show Buddhist influence but
I'm not making that argument.  There is ample evidence within the astika
tradition for this view if you understand it as meaning an ideal Brahman is
whatever.  However the format of the quote from the vajrasuchika upanishad
seemed reminiscent to me of the Buddhist Dharmapada.

Still this is all speculation.
