Consider this.  People in the West have no problem supporting and
practicing the ways of the various Vaishnava sects in exactly the same was
as they do in India.  So why not Vedanta?

The issue is not specifically the lifestyle, but the attitude towards the
lifestyle.  Whether or not support develops will depend on something more
mundane than pure intention.  I'm talking about education.  One cannot
expect the ignorant to support something they do not understand.
By dismissing Sannyas as "another lifestyle" you will create a situation
where those who ought to practice sannyas will not.  The view you express
is one I've heard before.  But no matter who says it, this
anti-intellectual stance must be opposed because no matter how lofty the
intention, it encourages ignorance.
