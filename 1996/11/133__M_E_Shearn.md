dear list
the question arises here, again, can realization of the Absolute, (which I
imagine the only point) which is the Truth, which is the Self - which is
Advaita Vedanta - be helped by discusion held by ajanis?
is this a place of knowledge or are we just 'proving' our own views?
now there is one wiser than The Maharshi and the christian chat room is less
dogmatic!

Lord help us

Om Namo Sivaya
