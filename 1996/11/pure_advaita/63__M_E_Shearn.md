namaste dude and dudettes,

can pure advaita be spoken by other than pure silence?

Talk is for those of lesser ripeness,

like us.

Ignorance speaks to illusion,

while Jnana knows only it Self.

Yet through the Guru's Grace,

bahkti ends in emptiness,

karma gives way to stillness,

intelect is absorbed into silence

all of which always is only and ever

Brahman.

AUM

And is a clear example of why logic is only a tool, not an end unto
itself.

There is no foolproof philosophical system that doesn't have some
logical contradiction in it.   There is a lot of dancing around done
in advaita, vishishtadvaita, dvaita, madhyamika, etc. to try and avoid
that logical contradiction, when it is part of the nature of reality
itself.

For example, there is only one subject, there exists nothing other
than this subject, yet all objects are contained within it.

Abhinavagupta said:

"If the Highest Reality did not manifest in infinite variety, but
remained cooped up within its solid singleness, it would neither be
the Highest Power nor Consciousness, but something like a jar."

I find the best systems to be those that begin with the fundamental
assertion, the one that requires no assumptions, ie that without
consciousness there is no meaning, therefore consciousness is
fundamental (as opposed to "being" being fundamental - although we
ultimately find them to be the same).

Ramana takes this same path (which is where I first encountered it)
when he promotes Self-Enquiry - who is it that is asking these
questions?


Namaskar,

Ken
