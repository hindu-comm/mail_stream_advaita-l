Do I? Or is it just another theory which I use in order to
explain the cause of the experience? Does knowledge about
anything change the experience, or does it just change our
prior knowledge about the experience?

How can experience as such be reliable or unreliable?
It just is! Explaining it or forming a conclusion about
it(knowledge) and pondering over the possible consequences
is the catch. You can be scared only because of your
(prior)knowledge. Only in the absence of (prior)knowledge
or in the presence of knowledge about the arbitrariness
(or futility) of knowledge, there is no fear.

On the other hand, it can be terrifying only because of knowledge!
Because of evaluating it from the framework of knowledge. Of pondering
over the consequences of such an experience, based on knowledge.
Isn't it?
