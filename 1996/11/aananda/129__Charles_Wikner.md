Sound advice for the list :-)

Pithy gems like this delight the mind!

Do you recall the source of this? There is an obvious connection
with the mahaavaakya in Tait.2.1.1 and the etymology of Brahman
given in BSB.1.1.1 --- um, that should read etymology of the word
`brahman' :-) --- but why is `anantam' neuter here?

Regards,
Charles.
