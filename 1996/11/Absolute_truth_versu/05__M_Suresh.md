  What is not real should not need to be defined or mentioned at all.
  The very mention of the word ignorance gives it an existence. When
  we talk of the absolute truth nothing can be left out. This is unlike
  the non-reality of a mirage, wherein there is an objective
  reality and an *external* unreality superimposed on it.

  However nothing can be *external* to the Self, even if it is ignorance.

  This seems to be the reason why Shankara has termed maya as
  anirvachaniya, since it needs to be brought in at the vyavaharika level
  and denied at the paramarthika level.
