Is this also called Saadhana Panchakam ?

Even when one has a firm conviction that he/she desires the Self and
nothing else, can one do it (renounce the world) ?

How about people that depend on the person who wants to renounce ?
Is the person duty-bound to wait until the dependents are no longer
dependents ? Can one just walk away from the committments ? But then,
when do the committments end ?

What is renouncing ? Does it mean going away to Himalayas or away from
the world ? Or just simply shun the worldly activities and be within
oneself ? Does taking a salary cheque mean the person has not
renounced ?

In the same Upadesa (Sadhana) Panchakam (verse 4), Shri Shankara says

"svadannam na tu yaachyatam,  vidhivasat praaptena santuushyatam"

Do not beg for delicious food,  live contentedly on whatever comes
your way as prompted by destiny

Can a person take solace in this statement by Shri Shankara that even
though one does not take sanyaasa (becaue of other duties), if one
has accepted what has come his/her way, is that a satisfactory
alternative ?

I believe Gita supports that view.
