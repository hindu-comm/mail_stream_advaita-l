This is precisely the opinion of Ramana Maharshi also.

to say the least :-). As far as I know such claims are made only by the
Gaudiyas on the net.

Considering the fact that RM has called the concept of Bodhisatvas ridiculous
(the same word "ridiculous" can be found in the talks), I would hardly see any
reason to call RM a buddhist.

Okay, the question now arises what exactly Shankara is referring to by
"jnani" and "knower of the Self".

The followers of Ramakrishna use "knower of the Self" to mean
"self-realized".   And I've read messages in this mailing list that
use "jnani" to mean "self-realized".

If that is true, then one can make a strong case that Shankara is
saying "Unless you're already realized, you need to do karma yoga".


Namaskar,
