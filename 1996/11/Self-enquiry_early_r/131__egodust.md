some
first impression
Self-interrogation
results

...

since only
That satchidananda-Self
is real,
all else must
   really
be nonexistent

   including

ideas of 'ignorance'

philosophical paradigms of
   *multiple* realms, events, things

mortality

ego(s) in bondage

psychopathologies

co-dependant 'sophisms'
  including dharma debates

aborted ontologies

limitation logic

***(all hypnotisms these)***


instead:
That permanent Self-nirvana
hath no protagonist
neither (!) antagonist

...'subject' reduced to a
dream of ether that
never occurred...

rather

Suchness Unfathomable:
[only] ever the essence of
What IS.

        ***

(remember how protest
arguments are Mind-born
empty and hilarious.

this is dictatorship of
atmanishtha.)
