I don't know about the Apastambha Dharma Sutra but I do have the
Yagnavalkya Smriti with Mitakshara.  In the Bhakshyabhakshyaprakarana, this
smrti says the person who eats beef will end up in a "ghora naraka" (Though
the literal meaning of this shloka may suggest this is only the case if it
is not an offering to Pitrs or Devas.)  The next shloka says all Brahmans
and Sannyasis of all castes should avoid eating meat.
