Namaskaar Madhav,

Let me take your statements one by one !

The poor trees do not have horns and they can't also  run away.


> Now you may question plants also have life why should you kill them? :-)

All convenience. A plant can grow its leg, hence cut its leg.
I think lizard's tail also grows again after it falls. Will you ...?
And an animal's blood if taken out as
blood donated in hospital will become drinkable by this rule.
Blood grows again !

Not all of them. Many took chapati and rice too.


> 2.  Taking alcohol

This is the real reason even for your being a vegetarian.
Why do you need to defend it by giving so many reasons ?


> And I was never given a single reason why should I take alcohol.

So suppose if one day someone is happier than you and is taking alchohol,
will you take it ?



I would say, take fish if you take it from childhood and your body needs
it. Take vegetables if your body goes well with it.
Live on dry leaves if that suits you.

I lived on fruits for 10 consecutive days. Didn't really work out.
Body strongly reacted. Back to my daily rice and chapati!


Vegetarianism is wonderful. But do not defend it against killing
animals. It will bounce back to you. And if defeated in argument,
(It will not happen if you take right approach!) will you taste Non Veg
in the spirit of those Mumukshus who became Shankara's devotees after
getting defeated ?


You will say No, I have been brought up as a vegetarian. It suits me,
my mind is at peace.

So these are the real reasons.
If somebody gives similar reasons for his/her diet, it's okay.

Remember that you have been made a vegetarian much before you
started reasoning about it.


I don't think that Vedic tradition is to be a vegetarian.
It is that what kind of work you do matters.


Deepak Chopra's books give excellent description for why
vegetarianism.

It is said that our mind is made from what we eat.
And may be science will prove one day the connection between food,
mind and peace, in that sequence.


Shri Raam.
