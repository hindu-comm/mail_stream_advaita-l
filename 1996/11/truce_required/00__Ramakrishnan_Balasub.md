I am sorry Ken, I have got it quite correct.

You are merely hiding in the technicality that you did not have the four names
in your quote.

Suppose someone writes "W, X, Y and Z, advisors of Clinton are crooks and
Clinton does not prosecute them inspite of that". Now you reply saying "I agree
Clinton does not kick ass". Even if you don't have the names of W, X, Y and Z in
your quotes, it means you agreed with the statement W, X, Y and Z are crooks.
Similarly it damn well means you agreed with the statement of Natha
likewise, since you replied to the original message saying "... claimed to be
realized *after* Ramana died" with "I agree dead gurus can't kick a*"..

Further when Giri asked for evidence, your kind self posted a philosophical
essay. Now it's like someone asking "How do you know advisors W, X, Y and Z are
crooks" and you replying "What good will it do anyway? All crooks claim not to
be crooks, blah blah ...".

So you chose to give some of your philosophy, rather than answering Giri's
question. Precisely because it agreed with the insinuation of your kind self
that Ramana's "style" leads to false gurus.

I advise the same to you. Now I chose to believe in good *faith* when you said
you did not intend to slander Ramana's devotees, inspite of all the *evidence*
(as I pointed above) to the contrary.

You certainly did.

I should be saying that.

A problem for you perhaps, not for me.

Ramakrishnan.

PS. I apologize to the other readers. I got into this because of the regard I
have for the Maharishi and many of his devotees. I will reply to whatever Ken
has to say by personal mail from now on, rather than filling up the list.

Hello,

I am hereby resigning from the Advaita mailing list.

If people are incapable of reading, there is no point in writing.

Appended below in its entirety is the message below where I stated "I
agree...".

As can be seen by anyone who can read, not only does it not state the
names of the four disciples (such as Ganapati Muni), but it does not
talk at all about whether they are enlightened or not or whether they
are gurus or not.

All it talks about is "lineage".

The Subject line of the message was "Re: Guru".

While I agree with your main point, ( which was concisely stated by a
popular false guru as "dead gurus can't kick your a** " ), I have to
disagree with your statement that a living guru must accept you.

We have evidence otherwise in the Mahabharata in the story of Ekalavya
and his guru Dronacharya.

And there was a person who later became a famous saint (possibly
Kabir?) who surreptiously followed around a master whom he wanted to
take as his guru, until the guru stubbed his toe and yelled "Ram ! "
(instead of a curse word), at which point he considered that he had
received mantra initiation from the guru and went off to practice
"Ram".


Namaskar,

Ken
