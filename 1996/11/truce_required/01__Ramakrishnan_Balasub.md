Sorry for the mistaken attributions and so on. I guess I also read more into
your messages than I should have, especially after your reply to Giri. I
request you not to leave the list just because of the arguments you have had
with me. I should have quoted the original message instead of yours and saved
this misunderstanding.

Anyway this has taught me a lesson, and I'll never engage in any such arguments
again. Thanks and please reconsider your decision.

Ramakrishnan.
