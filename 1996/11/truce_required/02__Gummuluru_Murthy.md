Dear Ken,

I am sorry to see that you are thinking of leaving the List. I am
writing to request you to reconsider your decision.

You have contributed important views on the List, and all members of
the list are benificiaries of your viewpoints.

In the electronic medium, arguments can arise and often we type in
things very fast which we later think, we shouldn't have done. Such
is the case in this particular thread.

I do hope that you would reconsider your decision, and continue to be
a member of the list and contribute your valuable views on various
topics. After all, we all follow Advaita philosophy in which the
momentary actions do not have any meaning.

Let us put this episode behind and proceed on to the next topic, being
all the more wiser for the experience.

Regards
Gummuluru Murthy
