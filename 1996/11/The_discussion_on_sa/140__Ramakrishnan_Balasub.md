This is on the recent discussion of the necessity of sanyaasa. The main point
is whether sanyaasa is possible without ceremonially becoming one. The answer
seems to be "yes".

anaashritaH karma phalaM kaaryaM karma karoti yaH |
sa sanyaasii cha yogii cha niragnirna chaakriyaH ||
                                                  (BG VI.1)

It is a different case on how probable it is. While it is easy to say that
sanyaasa can be achieved anywhere, it is quite difficult to actually do it.
Actually going through the rigors of sanyaasaa is bound to develop more
vairaagya and so on. Thus shrii sha.nkara's emphasis on the actual aashrama.
This point has been expanded by Anandagiri (that the actual aashrama) is not
absolutely necessary and was pointed out by Anand some time back also. IMO, the
Tiikaa of Anandagiri is absolutely essential in many places and this instance
is one of them.

Ramakrishnan.
