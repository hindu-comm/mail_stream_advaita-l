Whoa! Wait a minute here. Obviously Buddha means two different things. Because
the knowledge of the Buddha is _not_ in the teachings of the Buddha. Thus wise
men see the truth of GK.IV, which was _not_ taught by the Buddha, is the correct
interpretation. (the way Swami Nikilanada has interpreted it also). I'd guess
Madhyamika Buddhism is included in "the teachings of Buddha" also. Whatever the
case may be, it is quite clear GK.IV is not _completely_ satisfied with Buddhism
(Madhyamika or otherwise) by this single statement alone. That said I'll reply
to the rest of your post in maybe two weeks. Sorry for the delay.

Ramakrishnan.
