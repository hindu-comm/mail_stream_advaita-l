   Yes.

  Renunciation or sannyasa is based on the varNaashrama dharma. Just
 as there is brahmacharya, gR^ihasthaashrama, vanaprastha, the fourth
 is mentioned as sannyasa. Of course, in these days it is difficult to
 go to the forest and lead the life of an ascetic. It is generally
 accepted that the mental renunciation is equivalent to the original
 definition of sannyaasa. While this is certainly true, it should also
 be noted that mental renunciation while living in the midst of samsaara
 is much more difficult than actual sannyaasa! It takes no less than
 a jiivanmukta to do so.


 Shankara seems to emphasize that actual sannyaasa has to be taken up
 as a natural culmination of a spiritual life. See for example his
 commentary on the MuNDaka upanishad (3.2.?) where he says that the Self
 will not be attained by one who does not have the characteristics of a
 sannyaasi. Anandagiri, however, seems to differ here and suggests that
 mental renunciation is what is more important. After all, we have heard
 of King Janaka, who was a jiivanmukta and a King at the same time.

  The Gita clearly upholds the reunciation of the fruits of actions as
 the true sannyaasa. See for example, 6.1.
