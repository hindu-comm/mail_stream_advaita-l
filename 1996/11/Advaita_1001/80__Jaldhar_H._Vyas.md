Perhaps if all you know is the teachings of Vivekananda you might think so.
 However one who is familiar with the entire Vedantic tradition which
stretches back a couple of thousand years before him may think otherwise.

Vivekanand was a follower of the Brahmo Samaj before meeting Ramakrishna.
Educated in colonial schools, he had next to no knowledge of Sanskrit.  He
has no parampara having simply assumed sannyasa without any sort of diksha.
 His guru Ramakrishna, could not have taught him Vedanta either not being
much of a scholar himself.

Now, this doesn't mean the two weren't nice people or important in other
ways but they are not reliable guides to the doctrines of Vedanta.

Of course you can.  If your study of Vivekananda has led you to believe
otherwise, this is further evidence he didn't understand Vedanta.

A person who is truly realized creates no karma.

Karma is only created by performing an action with the attitude that
one is performing the action  :-)   IE that one is this limited
individual.

Since a realized person is one who no longer thinks that they are this
limited individual, then they also create no karma.


Namaskar,

Ken
