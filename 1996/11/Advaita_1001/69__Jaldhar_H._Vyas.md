The Gita is Smrti and thus appropriate for Shudras and others who are not
eligible to study the Upanishads and enter the Sannyasa Ashrama.  Hence the
slight difference in emphasis.  The goal however is the same.

Thanks.

The Chandi Patha is a section of the Markandeya Mahapurana.  It is also
called Durga Saptashati because it has 700 shlokas.  The homa vidhi based
on it is actually Tantric.  It is based on the Katyayini Tantra.  The
Guptavati of Shri Bhaskararaya is the most famous commentary and contains
further elucidation on how the homa is to be carried out.
