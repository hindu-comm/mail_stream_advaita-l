Shankaracharya is quite clear that Jnana may be achieved in any stage of
life.  Indeed Maharshi Vamadeva achieved mukti before he was even born!
For one who fully understands such texts as aham brahmasmi, there is no
desire for karma or its rewards.

However this in itself does not entitle you to abandon worldly duties.
That can only be done through the sannyasa ashram.  According to the
Dharmashastras Sannyasa is restricted to men of the dwija varnas.  (A
minority view is to Brahman males only.)  All else must continue
performing their all0tted duties until they die.

Assuming a person has the requisite adhikar to take sannyasa, is he
allowed to abandon his dependents, position etc?  Yes because these are
illusionary bonds only.  However as even the jivanmukta still has to
suffer the residue of karma from previouse lives etc. it would seem
prudent to wrap everything up as neatly as possible before leaving
samsara.

No. Such a person is still entangled in samsara and is therefore bound to
continue performing his Dharmic duties.  A person in such a situation
cannot be said to have renounced.

It is a commendable course of action for the grhastha.  It is not a
replacement for sannyasa.

Hello,

I have a suggestion/request.

Would it be possible to start a Sanskrit Glossary for Advaita-L on a
web page somewhere?

What would be needed is for list members to scan their completed
messages - before sending - for Sanskrit terms.

Then, they would add those terms and definitions (short definitions in
their own words would be fine) to the Glossary.

For example, I own a Sanskrit dictionary, but it did not contain the
term "adhikar".

And their advaita-specific terms used in the messages on this list
that are even less likely to be found in a dictionary.

I do find that using Sanskrit terms is beneficial, because their
meanings are more specific.   If one notes the current arguments and
confusion over the meanings of "knowledge" (always a controversial
one) and even "experience", the one can see the value of the Sanskrit
terms.

However, there needs to be a way to learn the terms that some of those
do not know, and I think an Advaita-L Glossary which would be compiled
as we go along, would be a good method.

Comments?


Namaskar,

Ken
