I have sometimes wondered about the same thing, i.e., sha.nkara's stressing of
the sanyaasa aashrama. Since the aachaarya has also written a bhaashhya on the
giita, which separates the sanyaasa from the sanyaasaashrama. Perhaps he did
not want dedicated aspirants into being mislead that they had actually
renounced everything when they had not. After all suffering the pangs of hunger
(quite a possibility as a sanyaasi) would be much more difficult.

Could you write up something about the chandi homam when you get the time? This
seems to be a famous homam among smaartas, so this might not be off-topic (I
hope)! I have often wondered what the homam is and it's modus operandi. Thanks.
