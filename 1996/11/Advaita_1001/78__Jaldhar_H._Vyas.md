Note what I said.  They are not good guides to Vedanta.  I wouldn't want
to be operated on by a doctor whose sole qualification was watching ER and
General Hospital on TV and I wouldn't want any advice on Vedanta from
someone who didn't even understand the language it was written in.

If the  world has given any other saints and seers who have taught the
truth then sure I'll respect them.  But I haven't really looked because
I've already found a source of truth.

When you have reached the end of your life dukrnyakarane will not protect
you. Do you know what that means? If so how is it relevant to the topic
you and I are discussing?

It is even more beneficial to actually listen to and heed the teachings of
saints than to just make things up as you go along.
