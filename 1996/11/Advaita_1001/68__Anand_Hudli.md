   True.
   In the giitaa bhaashhya, Shankara makes it clear that karma done
  with renunciation of fruits thereof acts as a great purifier and leads
  one to jnaana. However, he is quite emphatic in saying that it is jnaana
 alone, not a combination of karma and jnaana, that results in mokshha.
 He makes the same argument in the upadeshasaahasrii also, regarding the
 combination of karma and jnaana. But the Achaarya does recognize that not
 everyone is fit for sannyaasa, citing Arjuna as an example, and points out
 that Krishna prescribes karma yoga (and bhakti) to such persons.
