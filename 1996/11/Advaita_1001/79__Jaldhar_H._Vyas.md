No Moksha concept in Advaita!  How can anyone who has studied the subject
for even one day say such a thing.  Moksha, freedom from the cycle of birth
and rebirth is the whole point of Vedanta.  Jnana, the knowledge of the
identity of the atma and Brahman is not just some meaningless factoid like
the shoe size of the 17th president of the US.  It is the cause of Moksha.
