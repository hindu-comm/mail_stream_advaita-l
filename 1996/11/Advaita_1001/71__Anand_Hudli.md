  See for example,  Shankara's Giitaa bhaashhya 3.5:

   ajnaananaameva hi karmayogaH, na jnaaninaaM| jnaaninaaM tu guNaiH
   achaalyamaanaanaaM svataH chalanaabhaavaat.h karmayogaH na upapadyate|

   Karma yoga is (prescribed) for the ignorant alone, not for the jnaani's.
   Since the jnaani's, who are not affected by the guNas (sattva, rajas, and
  tamas), do not act of their own accord, karma yoga is not suitable.

   yastu anaatmajnaH choditaM karma naarabhate iti tat.h asat.h

   If one, who is not a knower of the Self, does not perform the enjoined
   duties, then it is wrong.

   yathaabhimatapurushharthasaadhanaM karma upadishatyagre |
    ( Commentary on Brihadaranyaka upanishad 5.1.1)

   For one who is naturally associated with ignorance and has defects
   of attachment and the like, karma (Vedic) is prescribed so that he
   may achieve his personal purushhaarthas.


   praagaatmajnaanaat pravR^ittyupapatteH
   (Commentary on Br. Up. 4.5.15)

   Before the dawn of Self-knowledge, actions or rites are appropriate.

   sthaapayituM mandamadhyamottamabuddhitvaat puMsaamiti |
   (Commentary on the Brahmasutra  3.2.33)

   Not all persons are capable of fixing their mind on the infinite
   Brahman, devoid of all transformations. This is because people are
   of inferior, middling or superior intellect.

   There are other quotes, but I will stop here for brevity's sake.

   How would the Vaishnavas explain the above quotes and other such
   writings of Shankara? While I see no reason why Shankara was not
   a Vaishnava, I have problems in accepting that he was no real
   advaitin. Even Gaudapaada, Shankara's paramaguru was a worshipper
   of NaaraayaNa. To say that he was just that, ie. a worshipper of
   NaaraayaNa (in a dvaitic sense), is a gross distortion.

  Considering the fact that Shankara and other well known advaitins
  have criticized Buddhism, it is not appropriate nor even rational to
  speculate that they were really buddhists.
