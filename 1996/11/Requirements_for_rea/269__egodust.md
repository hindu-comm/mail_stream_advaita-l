Before in fact I confuse the issue, please allow me to further qualify what I
wrote in my last post--since I forgot it was being addressed to the List, and
assumed something that Giri would have understood without further explanation,
since we discussed it earlier in a private email.

Here's what I previously emailed to Giri:
I remember reading somewhere Bhagavan RM talking about Sankara's formula,
and relating the third postulate as being "The world is Brahman," whereas
the Sanskrit transliteration says, "The jiva is Brahman."  But I think
it would be much clearer if it read, "The sohamidam is Brahman," since the
entirety of the manifestation of the mahamahat (saguna brahman, mulaprakrit)
is the [really 3 in 1 phenomenon of] jagat, jiva, and isvara.  And to say
that, in fact, this 'creative outbreath' is a singular product of, and not
different *from* Parabrahmam, would leave little room for misunderstandings.
What do you think?

Hope this clarifies the above.

namaste.

Re: vasana

Actually, vasana is a dwelling. In this context, they are obviously
referring to vaasanaa (vAsanA) which means craving and longing. This
craving and longing creates an imprint in you which is called saMskaara-s.
saMskaara is the latent impression of mental, physical actions.
Thus saMskaara is responsible for the conditioned response to the object
of experience. Thus there is a difference between vaasanaa and saMskaara.
These words should be available in the online sanskrit dictionary.

Re: mayavada.

        Sometimes the dvaitins use the word 'mayavada' to describe
shankara's philosophy in a derogratory way. i tell them that Shankara's
philosophy is brahman-vada :-) Of course, i knew that egodust used the
words mayavadi in a different sense but couldn't resist :-)
