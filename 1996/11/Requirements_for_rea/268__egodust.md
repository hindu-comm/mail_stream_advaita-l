Isn't the 'mini-doctrine' of mayavada (in the selective sense of its being
an aside or a sort of 'skewered corollary' that can explain the consensual
belief in the advent of the world-appearance) based on Sankara's formula:
brahma satyaM, jagat.h mithyaa, jiivo brahmaiva na paraH
...and thereof incorporated into 'Brahma-vada'...in the identical sense as
the axiom referenced above?

Stop confusing me!  :-)
