        To my knowledge, Satya Sai Baba has produced feasts which include
rice, chappatis etc "from thin air." I am sure more knowledgable readers
of Satya Sai Baba can dig up actual references, if needed. This "fact"
was even mentioned in one of the episodes of the TV serial, X-files.
Please note that I don't contend (or deny) that Satya Sai Baba is a jnani
or a possessor of siddhis etc.

        Even this is a belief, as you know. As i mentioned previously,
many indologists contend that the bhagavad gita was a later insertion into
Mahabharata to refute samkhya. See Nakamura's "History of Early vedanta"
for many references.

        i think we should call the philosophy of Shankara 'brahman-vada'
and not mayavada  :-) since maya is not ultimately real.

        There are a few (8-10) dharma shastras available in transliterated
sanskrit on the net, including the apastamba dharma sastra.

Namaste.
