Nagy - First I donot know the answer to your question.  Below are my
guesses: Take it with a grain of salt or chilli if you like it!

 Bharatam also contains  18 parvas.  Number 18 is called Jayam  - which
also means victory.  That is why Mahabharatam is also called Jayam - since
it is the the victory of the good over the evil. The war also took place
for 18 days.  18 seems to be a sentimenatal number.

 Eighteen consists of 1 and 8 - There is an relationless relationship
between 1 and 8 -
Krishna says in 15th chapter- my 8 fold nature of prakriti - pancha bhutas
+ mind- buddhi and jeeva - Bhuumiraaponalo vaayu .....
Mayaadhyakshena prarkriti ---- So He is separating himself, the one, from
prakriti.
