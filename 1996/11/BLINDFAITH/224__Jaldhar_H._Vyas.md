Well in this case 51 may be correlated with the letters of the alphabet
that play an important part in mantra shastra.  33 consonants and 18 vowels
(the long and short forms of a, i, u, rr, lr, e, o, anuswara, visarga,
jihvamulia, and upadhmaniya.)  But not being too familiar with Tantric
thought, this is just a guess.
