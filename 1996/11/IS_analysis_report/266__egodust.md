The way to the
realization of Self
is so easy and simple
that that's precisely
what makes it so difficult!
...because the nature
of the Mind
seems so complex.
Does this make sense?
Of course not.
That's why Self-realization
has to *already*
be here now...

Does this make sense?
Of course not!
Neither does moksha.
