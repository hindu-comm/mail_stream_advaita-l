namaste ya'all
thank you sadandana for your wisdom
Realization is such a joy even, if it is only in my ignorant ego's
conceptual approach to it!

>Hence fear is nothing to do with Brahman.<
>It is the ego's delusion.<



It seems nothing has to do with Brahman, save Brahman.
Can other than the Absolute realize it Self?
All else, even my Guru, is the ego's delusion. Like a decoy used to catch
it's prey, unreal except in ignorance, He draws 'us' to our (ego)death by
seeming to be in a body. What unknowable Compassion and Grace.
I meditate so as to die to Him daily.
