I agree.  You can't be a separate "witness" to your own awakening.  In fact,
when you (at least, seemingly) "arrive" at that place-less place within your
heart of hearts, there will be no one there at all to greet you.

powerful image.  What happens when it swallows it all?

If God is "The Great Pretender,"  then you're only pretending to forget that
you're only pretending to forget.   Etc., etc., etc.
