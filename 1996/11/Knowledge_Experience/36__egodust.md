Would like to add this to my website, if it's alright with you.  Please
email me and let me know.  Thanks.

No you're not! :-)
Actually, are you *really* here now, answering?  Or half-really?

re: your discussion on maya as anaadi of avidya:

Nothing new here, yet brilliant in that no stones left unturned.  Clear also
how Sankara and Krishna both reinforce the unknowable, indescribable essence of
that which *somehow* seems to appear in brahman (anirvachaniyam).  This is the
magical mystery tour of the Mind...and its compelling trump on the otherwise
simple, direct awareness that comes natural to everyone, that can ever so
easily get charged with bewilderment.  (Or, so it SEEMS!)

Shows how philosophy and the pursuit of knowledge runs in an endless circle.
Whereas moksha reveals the futility in grasping for *relative* essences that
don't exist.  Such breakthru-to-the-other-side of rationalization reveals that
the entire spectrum of oppressive riddles in/of the Mind is smoke and mirrors
leading nowhere.

namaste.
