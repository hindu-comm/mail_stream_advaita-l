Well, when you said "difference in approach" I thought you meant some thing
like what Anand Hudli mentioned about the differences between Swami
Sachidanandendra and the traditional Shankaran philosophy (ie
adhyaaropa-apavaada vs ajaata vaada).

If what a jnaani is perceived to do is the yardstick, then there would be
pretty much no agreement among the actions of those who are usually accepted as
jnaanis. In fact, sha.nkara would be the complete opposite of govindaachaarya,
his direct guru! The latter was quite similar to Ramana Maharshi (according to
tradition) preferring to sit at one place rather than being a peripatetic
monk. And there would be no similarity between sha.nkara and hastaamalaka, who
did not bother to write varttikas or any work at all (other than the stotra
attributed to him), though all the other disciples felt he was the most fit to
do so.

This message did not come in the digest. There must be some bug in the software
since this happened once before also.

Ramakrishnan.
