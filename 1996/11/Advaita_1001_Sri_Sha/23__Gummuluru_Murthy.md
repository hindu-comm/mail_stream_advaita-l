I am well aware of that dialogue between Shri Ramana and one of the
visitors. I fully agree that there is no difference in what Shri Shankara
and Shri Ramana were saying. As both Aikya and M & E Shearn point out
in their response, both teachings of Shri Shankara and Shri Ramana
point to the same: recognition of the Self.

I am not saying the teachings are different. Their approaches are
different which I mentioned in my previous posting: contrasting Shri
Shankara's zeal to Shri Ramana's nrlipta or oudaaseenya bhaava (correct
English word escapes me), about the lineage of disciples of Shri
Shankara vs Shri Ramana not saying about anyone as a direct disciple
of Shri Ramana; about Shri Shankara's pro-active stance in spreading
Advaita vs the almost let the world take its own course approach of
Shri Ramana. May be, as Shri Giri pointed out, it has to do with the
time when these two great persons appeared and their pre-ordained
courses. As Aikya said, their visions are the same and we are blessed
to know both.
