        Actually, it was a personal e-mail to Shri Gummuluru Murthy and
not to the advaita-list. i said (in so many words) that the prarabdha of
these saints may differ. i understand that only the ajnani thinks that
there is prarabdha for the saints. Shri Nisargadatta said 'There is no
jnani for the jnani, he only IS.'

Namaste
