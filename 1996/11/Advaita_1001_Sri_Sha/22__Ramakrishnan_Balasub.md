May I know why you think they are different? I ask this because there is a
dialog like this in the talks:

Someone asked the Maharshi "I heard that you teach sha.nkara's philosophy. Is
that true?". The Maharshi replied that he taught what he had experienced, but
others found that it tallied with sha.nkara's teachings.

Now, I myself have noted a practically no differences between what the Maharshi
taught and the gauDapaada kaarikaa, or the upadeshasaahasrii. VivekachuuDaamaNi
was also translated into Tamil prose for the convenience of his devotees and
was quoted often by the Maharshi. That being the case I am not sure about what
you mean by the teachings being different. Thanks for any clarifications.

Ramakrishnan.
