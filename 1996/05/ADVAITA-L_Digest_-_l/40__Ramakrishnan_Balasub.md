As I mentioned before, this does not really matter. Sista and I had a
discussion about this once and I said that the "dream" state as said by the
vedic seers is the "usual" dream state and the "lucid dream" state would be
called the waking state. Ofcourse, the fact that one is lying down and "wakes"
up refreshed would make one call it a "dream state", perhaps. As I also
observed with some people who pot and so on, some of them seem to have
"visions" which they "know" is untrue, but still see them. This seems to be
similar to your "dreams". Come on now, what did you eat before going to bed?
:-)

Finally you anyway have deep sleep. So the arguments still hold. It is
interesting to note that gauDapaada calls both "waking" and the "dream" state
as the "dream" state at some places in the kaarikaa.

Another thing is that I have seen some lucid dreamers and all of them are very
light sleepers, are you also one? Usually nothing short of an earthquake can
wake me up :-).
