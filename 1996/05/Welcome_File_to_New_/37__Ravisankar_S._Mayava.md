vaNakkam - namaami - My respects to you all,

        I have created a Welcome file, which will go as a part of the
welcome message to the new members. Since our list is on a VM system,
due to some formalities, it will take a day or two incorporate it. I
am posting here so that you can correct/suggest changes in this file.
Thanks for your time.
