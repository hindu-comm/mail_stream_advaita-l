Greetings to all subscribers.

Brahmasatyam jagan mithya
jivo brahmaiva na paraha

As those of you familiar with Sanskrit may now recognize, I am far from a
scholar of the language.  However, in the interests of opening a dialogue,
I'm offering these verses with a query.

THis is a commonly quoted declaration said to embody the whole of Advaita in
a nutshell. "Brahman is real, the world false and the embodied self is verily
Brahman." The verse is usually attributed to Sankara but wise counsel has
informed me, this is not the case. Can anyone lead me to the original source?
