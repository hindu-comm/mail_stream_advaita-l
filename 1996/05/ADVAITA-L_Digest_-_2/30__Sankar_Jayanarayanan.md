Hi,

True. It's possible to be aware of the dream while dreaming. And it's quite an
experience. :-) But is it by deduction (inference by logic) that we come to that
conclusion in the dream?

Please don't misunderstand this, just citing an example: if someone were to
push you from a cliff and you did land safely on soft "ground" (say, a mattress)
would you consider that to be a dream?

More probably, is it not intuition of some sort that helps us realize the
unreality of the dream (in lucid dreaming) ?

Regards,
Kartik
