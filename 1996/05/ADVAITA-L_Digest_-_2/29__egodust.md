Namaskaar.

I consider that the philosophical ordering of concepts/precepts has its
place insofar as preparing the ego-Mind for its final dissolution.
However, regarding the ultimate status of [such] ideas, I further
consider that they are intrinsically arbitrary and, thereof--in the last
analysis--, irrelevant.  To wit: ideas that the waking and dream states are
projections of Mind-stuff, being itself a projection of Cidakasa, only
hold water relative to the phenomenal constructs of the shakti matrix.
And the changeable shakti expression is only some mysterious artform spun
from ParaBrahmam which, subject to birth and later death, even now doesn't
exist.

I submit that any settlement on any idea [including the idea in this
very sentence] is prone to annihilation.  Moksha will not tolerate it.
This seems to be the occult mandate of Siva.

praNaam.
