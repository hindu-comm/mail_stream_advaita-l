I believe an important aspect to this theory of knowledge is that all
pramanas have their own scope of authority. SOund is the venue of hearing
therefore its prevails when a clap of thunder is heard. Self-Knowledge is the
subject matter of the Upanishads alone, the other pramanas, reducible perhaps
to perception and inference, cannot hold any sway in matters pertaining to
the Self. Conversely, if the Vedas say day is night, they are exceeding their
authority and should be rejected according to Sankara. Therefore, I believe
Sankara intends it to be enough to say jagan mithyA when we simply understand
clay (figurative for the Self) is real while pot (all phenomena) is
impermanent and therefore an illusory reality.
