Do you know why it is doubted as a work of shaMkara?

This reminds me of the statement in the gauDapaada kaarikaa, "what is unreal in
the beginning and at the end, cannot have any reality in the middle". So jagan
mithyaa _is_ in reality jagan mithyaa also. Or am I missing something here?
Maybe this interpretation is for the disciple who still has the opinion that
there is something called "objective reality"? shaMkara himself says in the
kaarikaa bhaashhya that the ajaata vaadi arguments can be understood only by
students with sharp or moderate intellects. The rest he advises to concentrate
on the "similarity" of "Om" to brahman.
