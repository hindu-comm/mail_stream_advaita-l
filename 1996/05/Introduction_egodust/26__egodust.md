Namaste.

I found a copy of Astavakra Gita in the local library, and have since
recorded it on audiotape.  If you have trouble locating it, let me know
and I'll track down the name of the publisher, ISBN, etc.

Vasista's Yoga was found in a metaphysical bookstore.

Jnana Vahini was obtained from:
Sathya Sai Book Center of America
305 West First Street
Tustin, CA 92680

The remaining works were obtained from:
Arunachala Ashrama
72-63 Yellowstone Blvd.
Forest Hills, NY 11375

(ask for their catalogue)

OM shaanthi.
