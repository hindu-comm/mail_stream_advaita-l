The state you describe is not described as dreaming (svapna), but rather
jaagrat-svapna, by the kaivalyam. I reproduce for your benefit:

jaagrat svapna - the state of day dreaming, castles in the air. The fussy ego
conjuring up visions is the jaagrat-svapna state.

svapna - the dream state. Having _uncontrollable_ visions, sleeping after a full
meal is the svapna state.

In my case I rarely dream, even if I do dream there is virtually nothing
happening most of the time. It's like I'm just sitting there or something like
that.

Fine, but it's one thing to say it, and another thing to actually realize it.
Mere intellectual understanding of this will go only a certain distance, which
is the stage I am in :-).

As far as vyavahaarika goes, we have only logic and the scriptures (if you
believe them) to guide us. So it is impossible to abandon logic altogether.
However logic is powerful enough to reveal it's own flaws, akin to the
Cartesian way of thinking. It's like the stick used to kindle the funeral pyre,
it is finally burnt in the fire it helped create.
