        I am sorry if this debate on svapna has been skewed by the introduction
of the topic lucid dreams by me.
        Anyway, as I mentioned to Sista in a private e-mail, I dream
occasionally and whatever dream I have is lucid in the sense that it is
completely uncontrollable but I clearly am the witness. It is kinda like
watching TV knowing well that the characters in the TV are not real..
        It is certainly not day-dreaming and occurs only during sleep
after a meal (though not neccessarily a full meal :-).
        It is often said by various vedic seers that we should question
the reality of the dreams during dreaming and not in the waking state. All
I am saying is that I do and find the dream is unreal while dreaming (if
you can call that dreaming). A good question to ask 'where does this
awareness which says this is unreal go when one is awake ?' I don't know.

Namaste
