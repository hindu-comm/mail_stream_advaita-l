Of course I agree.  But you perhaps inadvertantly snipped the beginning of my
statement:

"I consider that the philosophical ordering of concepts/precepts has its
place insofar as preparing the ego-Mind for its final dissolution.  ...(etc.)"

Maybe I should have further emphasized this before launching any criticism on
the limits of logic [as it nears the threshold of final Liberation].
Undoubtedly, the sastric principles are indispensible--even critical--on any
path of yoga.

praNaam.
