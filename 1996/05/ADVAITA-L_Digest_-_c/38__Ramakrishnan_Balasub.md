Thanks for posting these criteria. This should tell us something about these
guy's methods!

The shaMkara maTas and the tradition hold the brahma suutra bhaashhya in very
high regard. However, I don't think even they would agree with this
hypothesis.

Well, I can see the logic here somewhat.

Cool. Hopefully later authors did not attribute their works to the disciples.
So how is the work of the disciples judged? :-)

This is also quite vague, I mean the "should not contradict" part.

Vishnuite as in vaishnava? How is that? And what is his explanation for the
maTas somehow becoming shakti+shiva oriented later?

They did differ in the kaarikaa and the suutra bhaashhya. However, shaMkara has
shown himself to be an ajaata vaadin in the upadeshasaahasrii. Ofcourse, he
does not emphasize the fact as much as in the kaarikaa bhaashhya. Not that it
matters anyway. It is quite possible that he was trying to teach different
grades of aspirants.

Now, I have a question here. The paJNchaaksharii stotraM has a bhaashhya by
padmapaada. Can it be considered a genuine work of shaMkara? By the criteria
above it will probably be rejected. However, this would be like comparing
uLLathu naaRpathu (reality in forty verses) and the akshara maNamaalai (marital
garland of letters) of shrii ramaNa and concluding that the latter is not a
genuine work of shrii ramaNa.

I have this doubt also.

Ramakrishnan.
