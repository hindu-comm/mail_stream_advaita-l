        Namaste. The hastamalaka stotra is available in transliterated form
(ITRANS) and in devangari script (as a postscript file) at
ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/private/sanskrit/sanskrit.html

        The ps file found at the above site can be directly converted to
a gif using the pstogif utility. Thanks.
