Namaskaaram.

Greetings.  And at somewhat of a loss for words...

This presumed jiva yields to the lone Reality in our midst.

Offered below is a poem that coursed through my hand last week
like a new river ... of unknown origin.

OM SHAANTHI.

praNaam.

********************

EVER BEYOND THE DREAM THAT NEVER WAS

O Mind...
O subtle crafty Mind,
I pay homage to thee...
For thou art that rarefied,...

Ever vigilant and watchful
as a sentinel guarding his king,
I shall not permit myself
breaking focus
not e'en for a split moment...
for thou canst ever strike
like the merciless scorpion coiled
ready to sting its victim...

Therefore, enroute to Liberation,
this jiva must stand guard...
there's no other way,
nor's there another solution
to hold [this] disease called the Mind at bay...

This scourge of terror,
this spectre of scandal and treason...
there is no other way...

Ye renegade terrorist,
relentless thief,
egoistic wasteland,
please understand that you
are ALREADY defeated,
since thou art non-existent!
>From the Alpha to Omega,
from Birth, through Life
and into Death:
merely thy phantoms appear,
apparitions undulating on the canvas
of spacetime,
devoid of substance as
they are,
utterly ephemeral,
utterly non-existent.

O multi-roomed Mansion of Confusion
perched on the cliff of Doubt
overlooking the Ocean of Bewilderment!

Whereof, each room [luring its
victim] delivers another philosophical
riddle...demanding resolution
before the chokehold is loosed,
only to be confronted with yet
another riddle in yet
another room, ad infinitum!
(This is the master trick of the Mind.)

O Architect of consensual Isolation,
can you not feel the pain of your method?
May this be the testimony to your power,
to your realness: Utterly
Meaningless, afterall, is thy essence!

And, strangely, to defeat you requires
no effort at all; yet
part of your masterful trick--having
started whence the very
dawn of your non-existence--
is the notion of the strife of life,
wherefrom you've managed to hypnotize
your victims, then
watching their attachment accumulate
like guileless parasites,
wherefrom effort comes exerted in all
directions within their theater, where you live
in their fertile imagination--which itself
requires effort [strife]
to uphold--all out of habit...
Yet should this very idea get shattered,
and soon shall it thus be--'Victory!'
is the jiva's triumphant cry!
...alas, a Victory over Nothing Itself!

How truly awesome thou art(!)
to trump the ghost of material
out of Nothing Itself!
Yet wise to your trick
becomes the jiva,
and in his vision,
in his understanding,
resolves the muktha:
who ever sees only Naught!...
for visuals are vain alchemy,
yet in pure Satchidananda he thrives,
At last triumphant in the Battle
that never took place!...

Therefore may these very words themselves
evaporate into pure ether,
for they have no meaning whatsoever;
utterly without purpose have
they been scribed.

Truly there was never a worthy
opponent before any jiva.
For ne'er was there even a jiva!
Or its Mind!  Or its Leela!
Such are words without any meaning.
Similar the words maya, jagat, isvara,
being purely empty, purely without purpose,
purely without form, or substance,
without essence, or reality...

All there is is ParaBrahmam.
Know this and be happy.

**********

(This the radical Demarcation)

**********

Never was the above named
duality applicable!

No-Mind is the experience.
Not a concept to be strived for.

Whatever happens...
Whatever moods or attitudes
are believed in evidence...
are intrinsically irrelevant.

The Mind does its prarabdhic dance,
as its APPEARANCE requires; however,
the Consciousness--as its Base--
is Pure.
Yet is [somehow believed to be] the
witness of that Mind dance.
That Mind dance which is non-existent!
which the Consciousness intrinsically 'knows'...
Therefore, whatever transpires is
ultimately irrelevant!

Mind therefore only APPEARS to happen,
and upon its appearance, if when the
jiva 'senses' that it's suddenly
entrapped (formed?),
immediately the Brahmastram
['Who am I?'] is launched
mercilessly...turning
it to the dust it ever was.......

The result is the Standard Background,
the continuum Satchidananda.
(What else can possibly be?!)
