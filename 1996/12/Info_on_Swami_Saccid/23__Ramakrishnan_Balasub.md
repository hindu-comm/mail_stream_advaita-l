It is interesting to note that Jnanottama in his commentary on Sureshvara's
Naishkarmya Siddhi, says that Shankara has written other prakaraNa granthas
also! Now, Jnanottama is said to have lived in the middle of the 10th century.
Still, that's a 150-200 years from Shankara and his words may not satisfy
all Indologists.

Definitely true. The whole problem occurs because one is trying to explain the
nature of avidya. Shankara himself deftly avoids this and Sureshvara is also
not keen on explaining this in his Naishkarmya Siddhi.

Perhaps, the arguments like that of Gaudapada (in II) may not satisfy every
one and that is why Padmapada et al try to give some account of the nature of
avidya.

As for the Swami's contention that advaita has been hijacked by the logicians
and the Yoga school, I don't know if that is a really bad thing. After all
taking good points from other schools is not bad. Gaudapada himself has set the
trend :-).

Ramakrishnan.
