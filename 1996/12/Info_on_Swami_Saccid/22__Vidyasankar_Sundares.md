I didn't know this piece of information. SankarAnanda's AtmapurANa is very
well-known as are his upanishad-dIpikAs. I have not seen vivekacUDAmaNi
attributed to him in the tradtion, but of course it is quite possible for
confusion to arise between SankarAcArya and SankarAnanda in later times.

I don't know if Swami Candrasekhara Bharati definitely says something
about the authorship of the vivekacUDAmaNi in his commentary. However, I
do recollect that the first verse, which is a salutation to Govinda is
usually seen as serving the double purpose of saluting kr.shNa and
govinda, Sankara's guru. I can check about this from the commentary, but I
guess the Sringeri tradition does attribute vivekacUDAmaNi to Sankara,
because Swami Abhinava Vidyatirtha says so in his introduction to the
printed edition of his guru's commentary. Significantly, Paul Hacker
thinks that the attribution is genuine, both from applying his criteria of
Sankara's authorship and from the colophons of all extant manuscripts.
This is unlike the case of a text like the dr.g dr.Sya viveka, which is
attributed to Sankara in some manuscripts and to bhAratI tIrtha in others.

SankarAnanda was a guru of vidyAraNya. It is from around vidyAraNya's time
that one starts seeing evidence for the heads of maThas being called
SankarAcAryas themselves. This could well be a source of mistaken
attribution of texts to Sankara.

I don't know about Jayatirtha and others, but Anandatirtha himself
(Madhva) mainly criticizes the views of the ishTa-siddhi, a work by
vimuktAtman.

Yes, I think so too, although the dvaitins claim that one Ramatirtha
has responded to Madhusudana Saraswati's arguments. S. N. Dasgupta devotes
the better part of one of his volumes of "History of Indian Philosophies"
to the dvaita-advaita debate. It makes for very interesting, although
somewhat dry reading.
