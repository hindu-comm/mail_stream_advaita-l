  Saccidanandendra seems to be quite convinced that the Vivekacudamani
  is not a work of Shankara's, but rather of Shankarananda who also
  wrote a Gita Bhashya. He compares the writing style, choice of terms, etc.,
  and arrives at this conclusion. As you say, he takes the prasthaana traya
  of Shankara as the standard against which he compares any work attributed
  to Shankara.

  On the other hand, given the fact that Swami Chandrasekhara Bharati
  of Sringeri wrote a commentary on the Vivekacudamani, it is clear that
  the treatise is treated as a genuine work of Shankara, in that tradition.

  Swami Saccidanandendra similarly analyzes another work attributed to
  Shankara, MahaavaakyadarpaNa, and concludes that it too is a work of
  Shankaraananda. This work is of the same calibre as the Vivekacudamani,
  but is not as popular, for some reason.

  Part of the confusion may arise from the fact  that every head of a
  Math is  called a Shankaracharya.
  When he writes a book, etc., he may simply add a colophon saying it was
  written by Shankaracharya, and people in another century mistake it to
  be a work of Adi Shankaracharya!

   I have heard that in dvaita polemical works there is *no* criticism
   of Shankara's works, but only of the panchapaadikaa and bhaamati and
   their related commentaries. If that is true, it is very interesting.
    Madhusuudana Sarasvati is much closer to Shankara and
   Sureshvara, as far as his philosophy goes, and his advaita siddhi
   has not yet received a significant response from  the dvaitins.
