Yes, which is why once the questions about sushupti rise in the jAgrat
state, one takes recourse to Sruti to answer them. The advantage in using
Sruti is that it is accepted by all vedAntins as a valid pramANa. Else,
the dvaitin will just go back to his basic assumption about the waking
state. However, he has to pay attention to what Sruti says, although he
may twist its meaning to suit his interpretation. Then I can turn back and
say, "Hey, your interpretation of Sruti is not justified!" In my opinion,
this helps to keep argumentation with a dvaitin more focussed on the basic
divergences, rather than getting bogged down in peripheral details.

Isn't it self-contradictory to say "silence is best" and then come up
with a lengthy piece of prose?

That is also a condition indistinguishable from saying, "I don't have
the answers, but I'll irrelevantly wave my hands some more, just the
same."  And if it talks like a duck and walks like a duck, by Jove,
it's got to be a duck!

Ah; that must be a mere perception of the waking state, and
an illusory one therefore.  Or, if you would have it otherwise,
it is not an illusion, and you are the one being worn down :-)

Seriously, there's many more where I came from, in case I
should stumble -- which is a marked improvement from the way it
was even eighteen months ago.  After all, this is just me
standing in for Guruprasad while he finishes up his end-of-term
work, and there are many others who can replace me completely.
Ananda Tiirtha, "who knows the words, the sentences, and the
pramaaNa-s," is a veritable conflagration that throws out a
trillion sparks.  It is the blaze that has to be worn down, not
the spark(s), for it alone possesses the ability to energize an
inert particle to create a spark; the particle has no value on
its own.

All right, well and good.  However, note that your characterization
is species-chauvinistic, and also says nothing about the state of
awareness of the jiiva when dead, etc.  This is not specifically a
criticism of the Advaitic view, but a valid one nonetheless, I
think.

Also, your saying "states of consciousness" seems to be at variance
with Advaitic thought, which considers them states of existence;
while I do consider them states of consciousness, it would appear
that your view is not shared by your comrades or preceptors.

No, not really; one finds a series of statements with "nanu..."
and then "ityAha," following which comes the main statement.  The
former gives a concise summary of the puurva-paksha position as
applying in that context, and the latter indicates how the
main statement answers it.  This is standard technique, meant to
illustrate the flow of argument.  If the puurva-paksha is not
correctly understood and appreciated, then the answers given to
it will sound irrelevant, and one will not pick up the thread of
presentation.

So you're apparently saying that between births, the jiiva is in a
dream-state, or something close to it.  I'm not sure if this is a
characterization given in the canonical texts anywhere.  It would
hardly be appropriate to take it as an ad hoc hypothesis, one would
think.

Your equation of jiiva = jiivabhuutaM is also not convincing.  If
that is the case, why is the latter word applied at all?  There has
to be some distinction meant, even if we disagree on what exactly
that distinction is.

And last but not the least, I am not aware that Ishvara is ever
described as being "deluded by maya" -- perhaps it is that He
appears to be "of limited power," etc., to *us* who are so
deluded?  If that is the case, then your translation is not
right, for "ignoring the perceiver," etc., ironically.

One question, though -- if the world of plurality can cease in the
sushhupti-state, and yet return, what guarantee does one have that
it will not return upon nirvANa as well?  And more to the point,
is it or is it not the case that anyone has so far reached mukti?
If yes, then why is the samsaara still continuing?  The single
deluded manifestation of the nirguNa-Brahman should have returned
to the true state, and all action ought to have ceased.  That it
continues shows that there has been no mukti until now in all
of time (which would raise doubts about if it will ever occur
in future either), or that there is actually more than one entity
needing liberation -- which would send non-dualism down the drain.

Also, there is no clear statement in Shruti that sushhupti is the
path to knowledge -- such is the *reading* of certain passages of
Shruti by you.  By its very nature, sushhupti is of the nature
of complete ignorance, and can hardly be advertized as the path
to knowledge.  That's like saying that pitch-darkess is the path
to light.  Highly unconvincing to say the least.

Does not scan.  First of all, while your notion of reality has to
do with something not being obstructed in all states, etc., I do
not know if reality is accepted as being quantized on a continuous
scale with the qualification that something is more real if it
lasts longer.  If it lasts forever, then it's real, otherwise it's
not.  There is no middle ground, and there in fact cannot be,
because under the view that sushhupti is a state of non-existence
of plurality, all things, even the longer-lasting ones, cease, and
thus must be unreal.  Your thesis that "each higher plane is ...
more real" would have to be rejected as one that favors the waking
state, etc.

Of course, even the "unobstructed in three states" argument can be
shown to "favor the waking state," etc., as I've already done
earlier in this thread.  But still, that same point applies more or
less independently to what you're saying as well.

As I already said, there is no clear way of defining "degrees of
reality."  Such a definition would run into the difficulty of
itself being only of a certain "degree of reality," etc., and the
definition would be subject to AtmAshraya, assuming itself prior to
its own action, etc.  Secondly, I don't know why you use the word
"finite" in this context.  Being "finite" or "infinite" is a
waking-state thing, is it not?  As such, how can one use it when
the sleep-state is the guide to knowledge?

I know little of Nagarjuna, but from my general impression about
Buddhists, I would not be inclined to regard him as a hardcore
logician, although his use of logic would probably be impressive to
one untrained in it.  Udayana, Gangesha Mishra, et al. would be
better examples of logicians.

Coming to the core of the issue, I don't see why all of them being
real is only in "a relative sense," or why it is "a rather vague
and inconsistent position."  The reality can be quite absolute, and
in fact, from what we have seen so far, any use or ascribing of
illusion is what makes for a "vague and inconsistent" thesis, while
reality does not.

But as I've said, how does one accept or define the notion of levels
of reality?

No, it will not.  Because, for one thing, spiritual truths are not
decided merely by recourse to a "spiritual consciousness," but by
reference to hard and verifiable sources subject to a strict
regimen and procedure of understanding.  Second, because the
confused, agnostic delusions are subject to error, which can be
readily shown in fact.  Your thesis would only work if it were
that all states being real means that all perception or thought
is pramaaNa, which is not the case.

Not at all.  The universe may exist eternally, but I may be out of
it.  It is only under *your* notion of mukti that there is a
conflict between the eternality of the universe and mukti.  In
fact, there are statements in the texts about people having
achieved mukti; Krishna says in the 'Gita that people have achieved
mukti in the past by doing some things He specifies, and asks
Arjuna to do the same.  Given that the universe exists, at whatever
level it may, either Krishna lied, or else that notion of mukti is
unacceptable because of the error you yourself have pointed out.

There is no need to go into specific characterizations of whether
not-real is the same as unreal, etc.; the literal meaning is quite
adequate, and whether a certain categorization is in tune with it
can be studied independently.  That is standard procedure, in fact,
for imposing conflicting notions on meanings of words before
analyzing the conflict makes for confusion and incorrect
understanding.

Given that you have already interpreted `nAsato vidyate bhAvaH' as
"the unreal does not appear," to interpret `nAbhAvo vidyate sataH'
as "nothing that appears is unreal," is wrong, and the latter
should be interpreted as "the does-not-appear is not real" (or:
"the not does-not-appear is real") rather than "the real cannot
disappear," because there is no sense of "can" or "cannot"
conveyed, nor is there any suggestion of "disappear," which is
different from failing to appear. Figure it out: under your style,
`na' = not, `sat' = real, `asat' = unreal, `bhAva' = appears,
`abhAva' = does-not-appear.

This, however, leaves a gap, because while one knows that the
unreal by your definition does not appear, and that something which
does not appear is not real, one does not know the difference
between the unreal and the not-real (from the verse), and one also
does not know anything about the real; sure, that which
does-not-appear is not real, but since the unreal also does not
appear, vide the first part, there is no distinction shown.  If you
take the meaning of the second part as "the not does-not-appear is
real," then one knows that the unreal does not appear, and that the
real does appear (not-does-not), but one again does not learn of
the difference between unreal and not-real from the verse, and in
fact the existence and characteristics of the not-real are left
unstated completely.

In summary, no matter how you try, the verse does not clearly
indicate that there are three kinds: real, not-real, and unreal,
and give the significant characteristics of each.  Something extra
has to be supplied from outside to make things click for you, while
no such postulation is needed if the `not-real as different from
unreal' idea is dropped (which however would make the verse
completely dualistic in purport).

Let's try a different approach:

na =         no; not
asato =      non-being; not-real
bhAvaH =     existent; existence
abhAva =     non-existent; non-existence
vidyate =    is present; has
sataH =      being; real; reality

All the word-translations may be checked with a dictionary for
confirmation; I already have done so for the writing.

Thus, `nAbhAvo vidyate sataH' has to be "non-existence has no being,"
or "the non-existent has no reality."   Similarly, `nAsato vidyate
bhAvaH' has to be "the non-being has no existence," or "the not-real
is not existent."

That's very illogical reasoning.  For one thing, it is very
incorrect to impose the meaning of "unreal" on the literal
"not-real" and then "provisionally" reason on that basis.  Let's
just keep things straight and reason firmly rather than
provisionally.

In fact, one notices that Krishna is clearly saying that the
non-real has *no* existence; if one does not grant your thesis of
unreal and false being two different things, etc. (which itself
is not a derivative of the 'Gita, but is supplied externally to
interpret it in a certain way), it follows that because something
that is not-real has no existence, the world appearance, etc., is
not not-real, i.e., is real.

To refute the same, you would have to say that `nAsato vidyate
bhAvaH' does not mean "the not-real has no existence," but that
"the unreal has no existence," with your own extraneous distinction
between not-real and unreal in mind.  However, if one were to take
`asat.h' as "unreal" then besides the verse being incomplete in
purport, all hell would break loose for you -- Shruti's statement
`asat.h vA idamagra AsIt.h' would mean "the unreal alone existed
before this." Thus, it would indicate that an empty void alone
existed out of which Brahman was born, making Brahman also
"not-real" under your own three-time-frames rule of reality.  Or,
it would brand Brahman, who is explicitly specified by Shruti
elsewhere as "idamagra AsIt.h," etc., as being unreal, if Brahman
is taken as the referent of `asat.h' in coherence with those.  In
the one case, Brahman has the same reality level as the world of
plurality, while in the other there is no such thing at all.

Also, to consider `asat.h' as "unreal" rather than "not-real" with
a difference between them, and to consider `abhAva' as both
"inexistent" and "non-existent" is vyabhichaara -- lack of
fidelity. If you postulate a third truth value or logical value for
the one, it would be only just that you do so in the other as well.
If there is some special rule by which the one has a third value
while the other does not, then the same should be stated and
justified as well; it cannot be simply assumed as an unstated ad
hoc hypothesis.

And last but not the least, if `asat.h' is "unreal" rather than
"not-real," then what is the Sanskrit equivalent for the latter,
and where is it found?  One finds plenty of both sat.h and
asat.h, but none of whatever stands for "not-real."

As such, it stands concluded that the distinction between "unreal"
and "not-real" is riddled with holes, and even if made, does not
serve the Advaitic cause well in the quoted verse, which firmly
equates reality with existence.

Indeed it's a pity.  But actually, a rabbit's horn *is*
distinguishable from "the paramArtha of advaita," in that it can at
least be sensibly defined, if not actually found, unlike the
latter.

The correct translation of the 'Gita says nothing at all about the
"really real," etc.  All that has to be supplied from the outside, and
even then fails to result in anything sensible.

All well and good, but you contradict what you said before, in the last
part of the final sentence, since it is evident that it is possible
for someone to be subject to error and to know the same, unlike the
previous, where you said that one would never know it.

The portion between the asterisks is the significant part where I was
pointing out error; of course it isn't there in yours, because you
expressly denied the possibility.

There is no jumping to conclusions; I was merely pointing out a
natural consequence of your own statement.  If said statement was

is hardly something I can be blamed for.

That's fine.  But there's one point to note here; in debate, if one
asks a question, and is given an answer of the form you gave, saying
"read the texts" or some such vague thing instead of a *specific*
text, a specific something, etc., then that is considered an error
on the part of the one so saying.  The analogy given to illustrate
is that if someone asks for water and one says "dig a well."

I bet you can't give me an offhand quote from any Advaitic text about
prAmANya-svatastva; your statements above might win you some brownie
points from some, nothing more.

In which case, why does it give that knowledge at all?  Also, even
if it is the case that one does not need Shruti to give knowledge
otherwise-known, that is not license by which Shruti can deny that
which is otherwise-known.  There is no rule of logic that if
some pramaaNa is not needed to know something already known, then
that pramaaNa may be used to dismiss that same already known;
that is against the grain, and in fact, one could do the same in
reverse.  One does not need pratyaksha to know the Advaitic truths
known from Shruti, and thus, pratyaksha can be used to discard
the same.

Even if you say --

-- that, however, does nothing to explain why Shruti creates the
phantom of an Ishvara, who is not known from any other pramaaNa.
That is a multiplicity of its own creation; if it is real and not
of its own creation, then non-dualism is lost, while if it is not,
then Shruti is contradicting itself needlessly, and creating an
additional illusion that we could do without; it can just easily
take note of the universe which one knows otherwise, and then
refute the same.  Why bring in an Ishvara at all?

I am not in a state of fear; thanks for the concern.  As far as I
know, no school describes moksha, or its conception of the same, as
one involving fear.

I have a pretty good idea of arthavAda, thank you, and know it well
enough to know that Jaimini does not discriminate between bheda-
and abheda-Shruti-s while calling the purport of some as arthavAda.
It is you who have not understood this and have bastardized the
concept by applying it only to the bheda-Shruti.  There is no way
that you can apply the concept of arthavAda to discriminate between
bheda- and abheda-Shruti; show me a statement of Jaimini, or
Bhatta, or whichever Miimaamsaka, if you think you can.  If it
cannot be used to so discriminate, then why bring it in at all?  It
is irrelevant in this context.

Also, I do not think that there is any deadlock in Shruti at all;
such only appears to occur because of your external postulations
imposed in its interpretation.  Shruti itself, and other affiliated
texts, say it is of like purport everywhere, an idea you have no
use for.

I do not give a higher reality to the waking state, and do not espouse
gradation of reality, in fact.  They are all as real as each other, and
Tattvavaada says that dreams are real.  So where's the question?

Thank you.  One tries.

In which case, we have a fourth state, one which is not deep sleep, waking,
or dreaming, but is a "kind of dream state."  I'm sure you can see why
that conclusion comes.

Unfortunately, _your_ analysis has no basis in Shruti, *even* under the
Advaitic reading of those verses.  That passage from the Br. Up. is
taken as referring to the state of mukti in Advaita, not the state of
deep sleep; unfortunately, that's one of the distinctions that has not
been kept straight by the Advaitin arguments in this thread.  Nobody
takes deep sleep and mukti to be identical or alike, for doing so would
make mukti reversible, which is not accepted.  I will not go into
detail about the interpretations of the passage at the present time,
because the material on both sides is vast enough to require five or
six full-length postings at least; even a synopsis would require some
6000 words or so, I'm sure.  This matter has to do with the different
readings of the Suutra `OM jagadvyApAravarjam.h OM' (which is clubbed
by Sri Shankara with the next, `OM prakaraNAsannihitattvAchcha OM').
Consideration of the way the Suutra has been commented by various
people, and how the Upanishad is understood, etc., is a weighty topic,
and I will save it for a future series of postings for the Dvaita list,
perhaps some time next year.

Coming back, even granting that your style of translation is plausible
here and for the other Shruti quotes, it still does not follow that the
Shruti proves that there is no multiplicity in sleep rather than that
the existence of such is not perceived.  The fact that events involving
multiplicity do occur while one is asleep, is a matter of common
experience; one may miss phone calls, appointments, etc., while asleep
for instance.  The statement by Sri Shankara that no statement by
Shruti will turn fire cold, is apt in this context, for denial of
multiplicity in sleep is of a piece with a denial of heat in fire, as
both are facts of experience.  Otherwise, one would have to dilute
Sri Shankara's statement as also being "from the point of view of
the jaagrat avasthaa," which I'm not aware has been done.

Reject even that view: but note that the analysis you give, that
sushhupti is a state of existence where multiplicity does not exist,
assumes as its core that sushhupti is a state of existence (as
distinguished from one of cognition).  Shruti itself is not saying that
sushhupti is a state of existence; it is only by assuming that it is a
state of existence that one can arrive at the meaning that it is a
state of existence where nothing but the Self exists.  This is a point
to be carefully appreciated: there is no way on Earth that one can
interpret that statement to mean that sushhupti is a state of
existence, per se.  It is only by taking that as an assumption that you
can interpret it as you do.  But that very thing, that it is a state of
existence rather than one of cognition, is what you were supposed to be
proving by quoting the Shruti in the first place.  Thus, your style
assumes the very consequence that is sought to be proved, and is in
error therefore.

You of course may object that even a dualistic conclusion requires that
one assume sushhupti is a state of cognition rather than one of
existence, and so the same error is made if the passage is interpreted
in a dualistic sense.  One can accept the charge, because it will only
mean that the passage is not decisive of either dualism or non-dualism.
However, it is not needed to decide dualism; it is needed only by you
to decide non-dualism.  Thus, the canonical statement that you quote as
proof of something, requires that very same something as its premise to
yield the meaning that you give it, which actually comes to mean that
you are presenting an extraneous thesis with the process of laundering
it through Shruti to make it appear Vedantic.

The concept of arthavAda is Jaimini's, and he makes no distinction
between statements propounding creation, and those propounding
non-creation; he is primarily concerned with performing sacrifices,
etc., and all that is external to his primary concern is arthavAda to
him.  You really have no business taking the j~nAna-kANDa parts of
Shruti convenient to you and rejecting the rest as propounding
arthavAda.  Even `yatra hi dvaitamiva bhavati', `tattvamasi', `ahaM
brahmAsmi', etc., are arthavAda-ish to Jaimini, and there is no basis
for deciding between dualism and non-dualism on that basis; to label
only inconvenient statements so is a rather disingenious ploy in fact.

The rest is a strawman -- no one has said here that the universe has
the shape of a tree; it is true that in Shruti as well as in the
statement `UrdhvamUlamadhashshAkhamashvatthaM prAhuravyayaM' in the
Bhagavad Gita one finds the upside-down Ashwattha metaphor being given,
but this is not to be condemned as arthavAda; it has a significant
meaning, and that it does is accepted by all the great scholars of old.
The fact that some have made foolish interpretations of such
statements, and have even gone further in making other implausible
claims, etc., is not evidence against the original statements,
especially since neither of us gives any credence to them in deciding
matters of purport, and said statements are not even part of the
present discussion in any event.

The point is, again, that there needs to be a predisposition to enable
the considering of the "jaagrat.h avasthaa" as having a certain nature,
in order even to give your style of interpretation.  However, said
predisposition is not coming from Shruti at all, and your accusation
might well apply to yourself with very slight change.

This idea, that these are "tangential issues," appears to be a rather
original and recent creation, based upon what questions an Advaitin can
_hope_ to answer, and which he cannot.  Those which he can somehow
answer, albeit not with any chance of defending against criticism, are
"radically different," and by that it is hoped that those few points at
least might be insulated from any kind of analytical assault.  All the
rest, which cannot be so insulated at all, are "tangential issues,"
babies abandoned to the pursuing wolves so that the core of the tribe
may survive.

If you actually look closely, this entirely subjective distinction of
"basic premises" and "tangential issues" is not made by any of the real
scholars, and to do the same would simply label one's thesis as a
non-doctrine.  Even the qualification "where the observer is removed
from the discussion," is not sufficient, since that itself can be
considered a point of difference.

It is amazing that you continually find it convenient to bring up logic
just whenever it appears to suit your purpose, and yet say the next
moment that logic does not help reach the ultimate purpose, etc.

And as I already said, scratching beneath the surface, Shruti does not
indicate that in sushhupti there is only one; such a postulation is
needed as an ad hoc hypothesis that is needed to interpret Shruti in
that fashion, and thus cannot be presented as its conclusion.
