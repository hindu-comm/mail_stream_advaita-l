You are correct. I was thinking only of the waking state, as debate takes
place only in the waking state. However, sushupti provides only the
evidence that no objects are cognized. For the advaitin, this might be
evidence for the absence of multiplicity, including multiple perceivers.
It is not necessarily so for the dvaitin. For the dvaitin, sushupti could
conceivably be thought of as the individual self entering some separate
world, without positing that this individual self is the same as brahman,
i.e. it does not prove that there is only One. Only Sruti does that.
