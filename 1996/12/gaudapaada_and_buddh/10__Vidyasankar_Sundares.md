Mainly because textual comparisons have been made only between the GK and
the MMK. At the very least, this shows that Gaudapada was very conversant
with the mUlamadhyamaka-kArikAs of Nagarjuna. So far as the MMK can stand
on its own merit as a work expounding Nagarjuna's thought, I wish to base
my opinion only on that work. I am no buddhist scholar, so I would not
know how to decide whether other compositions are really Nagarjuna's or
not.

Finally, I believe there can be a difference between what a text actually
says, and what it can be made to say. I prefer the former, without going
to either the one extreme preferred by Nikhilananda or the other extreme
preferred by Vidhusekhara Bhattacharya, and possibly you.

If so, why do it in a text allied to an upanishad, which is alien to both
yogAcAra and madhyamaka?

Also, I think we have to distinguish between historical reconstructions of
similarity/contrast based on textual evidence, and a religious assertion
of oneness/reconciliation. The latter is independent of texts, but is
liable to be read into the texts, something that might be far from the
intentions of the authors of the texts themselves.
