I'm sorry if I conveyed the impression of putting the Karikas at the
same level as some quotes in Puranas. However, I still maintain that the
history of Brahmanical-Buddhist relations in India is quite complicated
and mostly hostile. In particular, the non-acceptance of the Vedas as a
valid source of knowledge is a vexed point between the two broad streams
of Indian philosophical thought, viz. Brahmanic and Sramanic.

There is a passage in Udana, which has often been quoted by Dr. Suzuki and
other Mahayana scholars. Here the Buddha actually seems to affirm an
absolute. But this then raises another question. Did the earlier
Theravadins all completely miss the actual intention of the Buddha?

This again goes to the core of the debate. The Atman in the waking state
is necessarily the atman that all Buddhist schools deny the reality of, is
it not? In the Vedanta, this Atman is seen as the foundation (adhishThAna)
of all sense-experience. Does the madhyamaka affirm such a thing of say
the "bodhicitta" or of "tathatA"?

I think it goes beyong attitude. The brahminical attitude towards the
Vedas is as a valid source of knowledge, whether in the mImAm.sA system or
the vedAnta system. They also affirm the Vedas to be beyond human
composition. In contrast, the Buddhists would have seemed to them as
trying to substitute the Vedas with alternative scripture, which was
spoken by a human being, even if that human was the Sakyamuni. Note that
the Brahminical view of scripture does not accord the Gita the same status
as the Vedas, because the Gita was spoken by a human being, although the
human was Krishna, an avatAra. There is more than blind fundamentalism
involved in this.

No, Sankara is not merely dismissing madhyamaka as nihilism. He finds it
problematic that the madhyamaka does not affirm an absolute. Now, we may
differ on whether madhyamaka does affirm an absolute or not, but I think
Sankara is right. Nagarjuna's main intention seems to be to break down all
talk of any absolute. Four centuries after Sankara, SrIharsha openly
admits that his advaita dialectic is very similar to that of Nagarjuna's,
except for the fact that he affirms an absolute where the madhyamaka
school does not.
