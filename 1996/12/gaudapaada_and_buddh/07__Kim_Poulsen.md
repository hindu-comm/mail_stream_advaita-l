Agreed, and I hold this state to have been mostly unecessary. My interest
is primarily the conflict/compatibility between the source writings.

If it is the passage I recall it may arise from a confusion in translation
between the terms avyakta and akshara (which gave me the same
impression. You may refer to another passage, I'm not aware of the
discussion.

The differences are rather subtle and my view difficult to explain,
the buddhist  emphasises that it is not atman which is really
differentiated,
an opinion which is fully supported by the upanishads. There is but one,
the only one - paramaatman,  all other being effects - states, force, life,
etc.
   Especially the early buddhists concentrates on the human situation and
the lack of a permanent,individual self, and treats of the manifesting
force -
ahamkara (known under a variety of names, delusions of self, etc.).
   A full analysis of the buddhist anatma concept is, I think, larger than
my time and this medium permits - but extremely interesting.

  (The buddhists of course operate with their own transcendental source,
prajna,
and the canon of remembered sayings of the Buddha). I understand well many
of the reasons involved in the historic friction, the most important being
probably
the attack on the caste system by the Buddha. Another is some not very
polite sayings (one of which is quoted in my other post.)

  Please understand that I never identify a founder of a doctrine with the
general ideas of the followers. Neither does Shankara necessarily
(or the author of this bhashya), he simply comments that the difference
between Theravada, Madhyamika and Yogacharya may have originated
from the Buddha changing his mind 3 times or the different intellectual
capacity of his audience (a joke.)
  I must say that I'm not certain whether Adi-shankara wrote this bhashya
(notwithstanding the views of certain scholars), with its casual style and
lack of similarity with other works.
   But -  the author is a philosopher, he knows the voidness to be the
akasha
not the homogenous foundation of a world,  (the svabhava prakriti), but the
mahaakasha, universal space (2.2.22). Not the water in the jar, but the
very
ocean. This is what is ment by parama and para in other philosophies.
  "All these worlds are contained within THAT." (mokshadharmaparva)

   No, Nagarjuna treats his void as an absolute, refuting everything else.
But showing that three states are manifested from this. They are
the specific terms for the universal correspondences to the 4 general
terms of the ManNDuukya, so to speak.
   Buddhists in the thousands are nihilists (having missed a few finer
points) and their views are refuted by Shankara, Nagarjuna's view
cannot be refuted (as I recall). There is little point in discussing
further
Nagarjuna's meaning, however, it is a matter of interpretation.
  In these cases I always remember the words of Vyaasa, something
like this (on the Yoga and SaN^khya systems) - "which are dissimilar
if the speaker chooses to represent them as such."
