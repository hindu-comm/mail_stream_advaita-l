If we are to examine the views of Nagarjuna, we have to stick to the
mUla-madhyamaka kArikA and other compositions of Nagarjuna himself,
without bringing in later Tibetan conceptions. The Tibetan school of
Buddhism is, by its own admission, a mixture of the yogAcAra school and
the madhyamaka school. If you read Nagarjuna and his faithful commentator,
Candrakirti carefully, they find fault with the yogAcAra school for
affirming an absolute.

Nagarjuna is quite clear that what he means by SUnyatA is that all
entities are empty in that they have no "own-nature". It is not his
intention to set this "emptiness" as an absolute itself.

This is not Nagarjuna's contention, but that of the vijnAnavAda school.
The vijnAna of the vijnAnavAda school can be interpreted as being an
absolute, but equating SUnyatA to an absolute does not do justice to
Nagarjuna's position, in my opinion.

In the vajrAyana school, yes, SUnyatA is an absolute. But I beg to differ
as regards the madhyamaka. Now, the question remains, "Does gauDapAda
interpret the SUnyatA of the madhyamaka as an absolute?" I think not.
Nowhere in the GK does he equate SUnyatA with the Atman, nor does he say
that the Atman is SUnya. Also, I feel that if he did equate the SUnyatA to
an absolute, something of this acceptance would have filtered down to his
grand-disciple, Sankara. I find it difficult to believe that Sankara would
refuse to accept that the SUnyatA of the madhyamaka is a higher reality,
if gauDapAda had accepted it to be so.
