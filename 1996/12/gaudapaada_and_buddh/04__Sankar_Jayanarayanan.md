But still, there remains the fact that Buddha was accepted as an *avatar*,
not as a demon. The Bhagavata and Matsya Purana speak of him as no less than
an incarnation of Vishnu. (The Vishnu Purana says he was the "delusive power"
of Vishnu). Of course, you could argue that Buddha's doctrines were not
accepted as scripture, but why at all should Buddha be accepted as an avatar
in the first place and not simply as a demon?

In fact, even Kumarila Bhatta pays a tribute to Buddha in one of his works!
(I read this in Mahadevan's book "Invitation to Indian Philosophy").

And I find it hard to believe that the "Sambuddha, the greatest among the
bipeds" in the beginning of the fourth chapter of Gaudapada's Karika is not an
invocation to Buddha.

So the judgment is this: Buddha is acceptable as an incarnation, but Buddhism
is not. I wonder why that is so!

This is not so hard to understand at all. For example, Shankara does not
permit non-Brahmanas to take up sannyasa; in fact, I think he makes this point
twice in his upadeshasahasri. Why should Suresvera, one of Shankara's greatest
disciples, disagree with Shankara on this point?

This is actually contradicted by Buddha's own words,"The Tathagata is not a
close-fisted teacher who holds some truths back." and then "I have taught you
all that I can" or something like that.

I thought it was Nagarjuna who denied this. Could you please send me the exact
words spoken by Buddha? Thanks.

AFAIK, yes.

Don't know for sure. Richard King has said something on this topic, I think.

I believe this is exactly the same stance taken by Gaudapada when he says,
"These people, who while disputing thus and establishing birthlessness, are
really non-dualists...we do not dispute with them. Understand that this
philosophy is free from dispute." (paraphrased)
