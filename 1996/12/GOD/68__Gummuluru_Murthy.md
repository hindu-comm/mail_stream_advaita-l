Shri Nageswara Rao brings in the topic of God and worship. My feelings on
this matter, which may be wrong, are the following:

For worship, Saguna Brahman with an aakaara (shape) is needed. For
meditation, there is no need of a Saguna Brahman. Both these are for the
purification of thoughts. Gaayatri japa, chanting Lalitha trisathi are
all for the purification of the mind and pave the way for the real
knowledge.

Praying on Saguna Brahman gives something for the mind to hold on to
so that it does not go on its aimless wanderings. In that way,
concentration on an aakaara (shape) is very useful and may be the
first step towards eventual Nirguna Brahman meditation. However, if
we attribute various powers to the Saguna Brahman, my view is, we are
on a devious route to ultimate knowledge and will be left in the quagmaire
without removal of the veil of ignorance.

Do I have a reference for what I am writing ? No. It is only what I
absorbed over the years and is based on my experience.

Gummuluru Murthy
