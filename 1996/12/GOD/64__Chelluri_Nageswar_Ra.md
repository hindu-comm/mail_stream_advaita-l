NAMASKARAMS!

GOD IS WORSHIPPED IN "SAGUNA" OR "NIRGUNA" ASPECTS.   I KNOW SAGUNA FORM OF
WORSHIP.   IS THERE ANYBODY THERE WHO CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE NIRGUNA
ASPECT.   I UNDERSTAND THAT ACHARYAS PERFORM NIRGUNA WORSHIP.   I CAN NOT
CONCEIVE OR UNDERSTAND NIRGUNA CONCEPT AS I HAVE MY OWN LIMITATIONS.
ANY HELP WILL BE APPRECIATED.
