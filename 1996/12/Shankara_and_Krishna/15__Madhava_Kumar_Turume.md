Take this reply in a positive sense.  Whom do you think is an reliable
source on Vedas?  Vedas speak of obsolute truth.  I think he speaks most
of the time about that.

Besides, he is the only one, as far as I know, who arranges Veda parishads
and debates on the contents of vedas, for every 4 months. Numerous Vedic
scholars are there in his Ashram. After Swamy Gangananda if I regard
someone for his unforgettable service to Vedas that is Sribaba.

I believe that Sri baba is one among a few hundred yogis, living on this
earth, who understand the truth and speak of it.  Vedas are the compilations
of truth.

Regards
Madhava
