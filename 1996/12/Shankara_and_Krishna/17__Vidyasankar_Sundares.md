We must remember that the question of adhikAra to study the vedas goes
hand in hand with the concept of rebirth. A SUdra was assumed to attain a
better birth in the next life, provided (s)he abided by the
varNa-dharma meant for him/her. The standard interpretation of the gItA
verse is that the act of surrender procures a better birth, which in the
case of the SUdra means dvijatvam. Surrender does not wipe out all
previous karma, because ISvara still has to hand out karma-phala
impartially. Besides, the gItA does not say that the prapanna immediately
attains moksha. There is presumably a time period over which the
fruits of surrender are seen. Then, in the birth as a dvija, there is the
adhikAra to study the Vedas. Besides, everybody is allowed to read the
smr.tis, which is mostly the itihAsa-purANa literature, and attain
knowledge thereby. The gItA, the mokshadharma and other similar sections
in the mahAbhArata and the purANas are presumably the texts for
brahmavidyA.

This may sound harsh, but we have to understand Sankara on his own terms.
The notion of samskAras and karma of the previous birth leading to a varNa
in this birth is pretty much assumed.

The way is through itihAsa-purANas. If I remember right, Sankara says this
in the commentary to the apaSUdrAdhikaraNa of the sUtras.
