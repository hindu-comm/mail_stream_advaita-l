Please don't worry about it.  Perhaps "violation" is too strong a
word, but as Ramakrishnan pointed out, it would be as well to let the
author know that his essay is being criticized, and give him a chance
to respond.  That's only fair.

Your posting that was forwarded to the Dvaita list has been responded
to there by one of our members; please look up in the archive if you
wish.

Have a nice day.

Shrisha Rao
