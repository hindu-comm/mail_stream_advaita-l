        i fully agree with the sentiments expressed by Ken. i also agree
the statement by Ramakrishnan that the person whose article is being
criticized should have a chance to respond. In the same spirit, shouldn't
there be a restraint on assuming that a mathematican (maybe referring to
Ted K.) as an "Unabomber." Is he not just an alleged "Unabomber" ? Doesn't
he have a right to be assumed innocent until proven guilty ?
        Regarding the advaita-dvaita debate, i am reminded of Shri
Ramana's statement to first discern the Atman and then determine how it
is related to Brahman. Ramakrishnan told me of a similar quote from the
head of Sringeri Math.

Namaste.
