    True, causality and implication are different. Causality is used
   more in proving a hypothesis (scientifically) whereas implication
   is used in logic. Since I believe we are discussing the issue at
   hand at a logical level, not a scientific level, I saw it fit to use
   the logical implication. Certainly, we are not talking (nor are we
   qualified)
   to talk about what scientifically causes dreams, etc.


   Moreover if you talk of causality, an important question remains
   unanswered -- what causes the absence of variety in deep sleep (
   sushhupti)? Deep sleep is also a state. According to you, if
   the absence of variety in deep sleep is caused by the variety
   in the waking state, then we will have the following relations

   variety in waking state causes variety in dream state
   variety in waking state causes nonvariety in deep sleep

   If this be the case, is it so inconceivable to add one more:

   nonvariety in absolute state causes variety in waking state

  On the other hand, if you say the nonvariety of deep sleep is not
  caused by the variety of the waking state, then what is it caused by?
  If you say the cause has nothing to do with the waking state, then
  you have admitted that a causal relation between variety/nonvariety
  in one state and another might not exist at all. So you can't complain
  if the advaitin says that there is nonvariety in the absolute state
  even though there is variety in the waking state.

  If, however, you say that the nonvariety in the deep sleep is caused
  by something that is common between the waking state and deep sleep,
  then you are getting closer to advaita. What is common between the
  waking and deep sleep states? It is pure consciousness. Is it not?
  This consciousness is of the nature "I exist."

  In fact, this consciousness is *the* only common thing between the
  three states commonly known to people, waking, dream, and deep sleep.

  Now, is there variety or nonvariety in this consciousness? This is
  question that dvaitins will have to ponder over.

   The difference from a logician's standpoint is not that great.

   For example, you can say flu causes fever. Absence of flu does not
   necessarily mean there is no fever, (because fever could be caused by
   other factors). You could also say, flu implies fever. And you would
   also be logically correct in saying absence of flu does not imply
   lack of fever. If there is no fever, whatever that state is, is not caused
   by flu. Logically, no fever implies no flu.

   A causes B does not necessarily mean not A causes not B.
   A implies B does not necessarily mean not A implies not B.

   However,

   A causes B means not B implies not A.
   A implies B means not B implies not A.

   Example, if there is no fever, there is no flu.

    I think it is not so fallacious as you think. And I am in good
   company. In writing expert systems, for example, it is routine
   to represent causal relationships as logical implications.

  Your criticism that my criticism is based on a false presumption is
  unfounded.

  Then duality is taken as an axiom. Incorrectly perhaps. because
  the shruti speaks of nonduality, ekameva advitiiyaM etc. So duality
  cannot be taken as a fundamental axiom.

   I can explain more. But let me mince words and say that the cause
  of duality and everything else is Brahman.  I only said the duality
  is not caused by duality in Brahman. But that does not prevent me from
  saying Brahman itself, nonduality is the cause of duality.

  this is where shruti will say " neha naanaa .asti kiJNchana"
  there is no variety here whatsoever. All logic ceases.

   Good. A step in the right direction. "sakhaa" is not an illusion. It is
  God. It is Brahman. It is you. tat tvam asi. Did I miss an "a" somehere?
