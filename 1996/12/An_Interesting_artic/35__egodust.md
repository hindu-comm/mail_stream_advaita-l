The entire dvaitic conception is based on the idea that the jiva is real.
On the 'path' to moksha, what does it matter if it's considered so or not?
If dvaitins are able to accomplish [their own professed] mission in the art
of surrender, we can then ask them how real the jiva might be.  If they'll
*still* uphold its alleged reality, then they haven't really surrendered.

namaste.
