Concur.  Thus there is no 'path' leading to 'moksha.'  'Moksha' is clearly a
fiction applicable to the fiction of relativity, where jnana and ajnana are
conceivable.  These are conjurable phantasms of the alleged Mind that somehow
spins its own astoundingly fantastic maya.  When its epic adventure into
infinite delusion is shattered, the whole polemic argument [of dvaita/advaita]

sunrise.

namaste.

Non sequitur.  Your conclusion does not follow from your premise.  The
fact that any path that does not consider the mumukshu to be real is
not one to moksha, does not imply that moksha, or any path to it, is
fiction.  There is no inference rule that would lead from that premise
to such a conclusion, and it is easy to see why such a one is
impossible.

All of that is an extraneous prevarication unrelated to, and not
following from, anything said previously.

You're saying different things alternately.

  1> You say neither happens.
  2> You say both happen at the same time.

There is an obvious conflict between the two, and unless you pick one
of the two as your firm thesis, your view would have to be rejected
as an inconsistent muddle.

That statement invokes "we," and is thus self-contradictory.

If that is the definition of the Self, then "Only the Self is present"
has no meaning, since one cannot invoke a property of definition as
one of qualification as well, with reference to nothing else.  That's
a epistemic feedback loop hanging free, with no basis or grounding.

If you say the Self is unique and cannot be given a basis, etc., then
that is a condition indistinguishable from one where a person
describes something false or illogical, and is unable to provide
support when asked.  Your thesis of the Self is indistinguishable from
a thesis of a rabbit's horn, and even the latter could be justified on
similar or identical grounds.

Which is an admission of self-contradiction on your part.  As you are
doubtless aware, in Vedantic discussion as well as in worldly matters
like sentential logic, legal debate, etc., a self-contradiction is
sufficient to reject the thesis on the side of which it occurs.

If the "dream world" and the "waking world" are not real, then how can
there even be any persistence?  Persistence across what?  Two
illusions?  If that is the case, then the Self, "that which persists,"
is illusory as well, for merely being a persistent common found in two
illusions.

That can only be so if things *are*, period.  If they have no reality,
then "things are not what they seem" has no meaning.

And what about a bad movie?  Also, the experience of the movie is
hardly an illusion.  The screening is real, the lights are real, the
projector is real, the reels are real, the sound is real, etc.

Which can be said about a rabbit's horn as well.  How is this any
different?  Also, "words can never describe..." is itself a
description of the Self, and in fact, you have also given other
descriptions like "pure consciousness," "one without a second," etc.
Self-contradiction (pun intended).

If there is no territory, there can be no map.  That is against the
concept of maps.  And in fact, if someone paints, say, a Picasso
imitation, that has to have a real Picasso as its basis.  One cannot
posit a universe with only Picasso imitations around, because then
they would not qualify as imitations at all, and their qualification
as "Picasso imitations" would be meaningless.  In the same way, one
cannot have the concept of maps when there is no territory, because
said concept cannot be conceived or defined then.

That's fine, but even then, the projector is something else, not the
screen itself; the act of projection is also different from the screen
itself.

If the self is "one without a second," etc., it cannot pretend to
become something other than itself, because pretense is only possible
when there is something else to pretend to be.
