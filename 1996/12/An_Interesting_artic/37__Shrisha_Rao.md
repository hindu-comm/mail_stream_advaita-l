In which case, the "arise simultaneously" is false?

Who is "we"?

What is the Self?

But since "we" are not here, neither is the Maharshi, nor his
statement.  Also, since "we" never either wake nor dream, what weight
to the alleged equivalence of the "dream world" and the "waking
world."

I seem to think that the "SEEMS" is itself a part of the sense of
waking.  So how can that be true when the latter isn't?

-- and the flickering lights, which are different from the screen, and
from oneself.

Not the analogy, but the theory it attempts to support.  The analogy
is fine.

Ah.  In that case, you're saying that I myself am the screen upon
which the movie is projected?  But since the perception of the screen
is part of the experience of waking, wouldn't the latter then become
true as well?
