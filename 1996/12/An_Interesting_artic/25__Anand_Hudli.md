   First misconception. Jeeva-brahma-aikya is not something that is
   established by logic alone. It has basis in Shruti. Many Shruti
    statements affirm it. Further, whenever there is a conflict between
   logic and what the shruti says, the latter prevails.

   Really?

   There are serious logical flaws in *this* argument. First, it assumes
   that the relationship between the "absolute" state and the waking
   state is exactly like the relationship between the waking state
   and the dream state. How do we know this? In other words,

    variety in dream state  implies   variety in waking state

     does not necessarily imply


    variety in waking state  implies variety in absolute state


    There would be such an implication if the absolute state were
    similar to the two other states in some sense. But this is impossible
   according to the scriptures. The absolute is not only advaita (devoid
   of duality) but also advaya (one without a second) and nirupama
   (incomparable to anything).

   So the absolute state cannot be compared to any state or for that matter
   anything at all.  The statement :

   The absolute state must be similar to the waking state

   and even the statement:

   the relationship between the absolute and waking state is similar
   to the relationship between the waking and dream state

   are both not logically provable.


   Now, even if we allow that these are provable, there is another
   logical flaw in the dvaitin's argument.

   This flaw is the familiar infinite regress.

   Suppose the absolute state were to have variety or duality. Then
   its duality would be the result of the duality existing in a
   higher absolute state. The duality in this higher absolute state
   would be inferred from the duality in a yet higher state. The
   duality in this third absolute state would be inferred from the
   duality in state higher than it and so on. This leads to infinite
   regress. And it would be impossible to speak of the highest state
   "VishhNoH paramaM padaM" which we often hear from the Vedas.

    So the highest state must necessarily be not only advaita but also
    advaya (one without a second) and nirupama (incomparable to anything).

  Maybe according to PuraaNas and other fairy tales. But I seriously doubt
  if the Vedas say so.
