It may be that skill in math is different from, or unrelated to, skill
in philosophical reasoning, perhaps?  I'm sure he will do better in
his next effort.  Don't be too harsh on him yet.  And besides, the
Unabomber was a mathematician -- don't speak ill of anyone who does
math, 'cause you never know when you'll see your mistake blow up in
your face.

-- which, upon closer scrutiny, aren't.  You can't tell with these
mathematicians; they're a different breed from normal human beings, I'm
convinced of it.  Anyone who can add two alphabets and come up with a
third is a mad genius; me, I can't even add two straight numbers.

In which case, Sri M K Turumella isn't an Advaitin, 'cause he said
they are "nothing but illusion," and even justified the illusory
nature of the universe itself on that basis. It's there in the
archive.  But perhaps he was wrong --

If that is the case, then why are you talking of their reality or
otherwise, by saying they are not unreal, that they are real enough to
the dreamer, and that they seem to be real as long as the dream
persists?

Now see.  Not too long ago it seemed like you were saying that Anand Hudli
was right in criticizing Guruprasad for saying that the relationship
between dreams and waking is not of a piece with that between waking and
the absolute.  Yet, you are saying the same above?

If you are not saying the same, then the "Brahman" referred to must be the
Ishvara or the saguNa-Brahman, and saying that the universe has no reality
apart from Him, is a dualistic truth that describes something other than
the highest.  Was this your intention?

That's not quite right.  David Hilbert would never have formulated the
famous Hilbert's Program, an idea to automate all theorem-proving
completely, had he known and understood prAmANya-svatastva.  And
besides, the meaning of prAmANya-svatastva is not that all cognition
(all pramANa, actually) is valid by itself -- if it were so, then
there would be no incorrect cognition at all, and/or any conflicts
that arose would be eternally unresolved.  It is that the prAmANya of
any cognition is perceived by the same agent as responsible for the
cognition itself, as part of the same knowledge.  This keeps the door
open to possible aprAmANya, whose paratastva again means that the
aprAmANya is perceived via a different source than the original
cognition.  This is quite non-trivial, and I submit any human being
who can think up all this by himself is very much out of the
ordinary.

Well, but there certainly is a basis for attributing a higher reality
to the waking than to the dreaming.  For the theory of Advaita, the
fact of Shruti, etc., exist only in the waking state!

-- or, in other words, it asks you to assume that in ultimate reality
there is but one perceiver?  How is that any different from assuming
that there are many?  At least, there is cognition (your style of
svataH pramANa, even) for there being many perceivers; what cognition
exists to show that there is only one?

Well, no.  The "blind logic of the dvaitin" will merely say that you
cannot define what you mean by "real" without reference to the waking
state, and that thus, its reality is a matter of definition rather
than assumption.  If you can show differently, I'll be glad to learn.

That's good.  Let's start, then, by questioning the validity of the
assumption that there is one ultimate reality of *the* perceiver
himself.

But isn't it the case that the "knowledge of the Atman gained from Sruti"
is itself channelled through the knowledge of the waking state?  And
that if the latter is opposed by the former, and the former is true,
then we have a logical error?

Be careful saying such things when you're around mathematicians who
happen to be Dvaitins.  Don't say I didn't warn you...

Or, in other words, we dream at the same time as we are wakeful?

Of course it occurred.  Movies are made at tremendous cost, etc.; they
don't happen by themselves.
