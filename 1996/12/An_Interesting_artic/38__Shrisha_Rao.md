I am not aware that there is any such separation between science and
logic; to posit such would automatically imply that science is not
logical, and that logic is not scientific.  I do not accept either to
be the case.  And also, why are we automatically unqualified to talk
about what causes dreams, etc.?  Studying the same has been the effort
of Vedantins as well as modern scientists, and both have tried to
present their conclusions in a manner that even people of limited
training can appreciate.  And in fact, even psychologists are not
necessarily in any better shape than keen amateurs, in appreciating
the causes of dreams, &c., because they are not wizards or geniuses.

But anyway, all of this is a digression.  Let's go on --

Mind you, it is not accepted by me that variety in one state is caused
by that in another, and such, at all.  So where's the question?  Also,
the different states waking, dreaming, sleep represent different
states of cognition, not different states of reality as such.  It may
be that while you are fast asleep, someone else is wide awake and
perceives things you temporarily do not.  And vice versa.  As such,
variety is always there, but is sometimes perceived and sometimes
not.  There is no question of it being caused by something else, etc.,
and variety exists even when one is in deep sleep, only one is not
aware of it.

As I said, causation of variety is part of your hypothesis, not mine.
When I deny any cause for variety, where's the validity to the above?

>   On the other hand, if you say the nonvariety of deep sleep is not
>   caused by the variety of the waking state, then what is it caused by?

Two things: first, "nonvariety of deep sleep" is false -- variety is a
fact, in deep sleep and in every other state.  If variety were ever to
cease, then it should cease for all, not locally for some particular
sleeper(s), and secondly, it should never come back, while it does
always do so.  If you would assert that knowing something is the same
as causing it, et cetera, that would be a vignyaanavaadi position, and
one might well ask if the Brahman, or Self, or whatever, is a
temporary illusion caused by knowledge of the same, rather than a
permanent reality.  As such, the fact that variety is discontinuously
known is not evidence that it is discontinuous in its presence.

As I said above, the very idea that there is a cause, is part of your
idea and not mine.

Not just _that_ consciousness, but all else seen in the waking is
common.  The fact that I cannot see the other side of the moon, the
one that's always pointed away from the Earth, does not mean that said
other side does not at all exist.  It is possible to infer its
existence from the part that I can see.  So also, I can infer the
continuous existence of the wakefully experienced over my sleeping
periods, even though I then have no perception of the same while
asleep, because there is no "bAdhaka" (obstacle) for this inference
showing its invalidity.  And in fact, this inference is commonly
made.  How else would I know that I am the same person with the same
name, that this is the same terminal I used before, etc., although
there has been a sleep period in between?  If there were discontinuity
in the reality of the wakefully experienced, I would not have a
continuous identity, my education, etc., would not be possible, and so
on.  Thus, since there is a continuity of identity over the deep sleep
state, it has to be said that all that is seen in waking is also
common to the sleeping, although it is not perceived then.

Or look at it in another way: on what basis do you say that there is
*anything* at all, even the "pure consciousness" of the nature of "I
exist" in common to waking and sleep?  How can one say that there is
any consciousness at all in sleep?  Why not say there is a nihil state
where one does not exist at all?  The answer can only be that to say
so is opposed to experience, specifically, to experience upon
awakening, since one remembers having slept soundly and having enjoyed
the experience.  But, given the fact that the "I" who enjoyed the
sleep and the "I" who awoke can only be identified as the same by
wakeful experience, there is no way on Earth to dilute the strength of
reality of that experience and still assert the identity.  If the
waking is illusory, et cetera, then the memory, "I slept well," which
is part of the waking, would also be illusory, as the Buddhists would
assert, and there is nothing at all in common between the waker and
the sleeper.

I've attended to that above.  Going on --

Again, there is no separation between logic and science such as you
posit.

So much for expert systems.  That may only be because expert systems,
as indeed any Turing machine programs, can only model implication, not
causality.  That hardly means that the idea of modeling causality by
implication is worthwhile.  It is a fact that even today, terrestrial
astronomy uses the geocentric model that went out as a description of
cosmic truth some four centuries ago, but this is because from the
standpoint of a terrestrial observer, that model is the easiest to
use.  It does not actually mean that geocentrism rather than
heliocentrism is correct in a larger sense.

I think I've clarified: in particular, please note that the notion
that variety in any state needs a cause, is solely your own, and any
criticism resting upon the same, whether from a causal or an
implicational perspective, can only be a criticism of your own view.

Fine, so don't take it as one, then.  But the point remains, that
given that there is complete lack of agreement on this point, viz.,
that there is a cause for duality, your criticism based on that notion
is not part of a well-founded common basis.  That is the point here.

In which case, duality must be eternal as well?  Since the cause is
eternal, so must the effect be.  In order to explain why duality
does/would cease, one would have to posit another agency or upAdhi
than Brahman, the cause of it.  To say that Brahman causes duality but
duality automatically ceases without an adjunct while Brahman does
not, is opposed to the very notion of causation.  And if you could say
that, then one might as well say that Brahman itself will also
automatically cease although there is no cause for it to do so.

Well, no; logic doesn't cease, but just that it stops serving your
purpose.  If there is no variety here, then there is no Shruti either,
and nothing to take note of.  And it has been accepted by you that
Brahman causes duality.  Said duality, in fact, is part of one's
native experience, something which is a source for Shruti as well.

Not that I noticed.  But the fact is, a "companion" being not an
illusion means that _companionship_ is not an illusion either.  If the
"companion" is one's own self, then it would have to be.  That is
precisely my point.  Thus, the "Brahman" is not the same as oneself,
and to regard it as one is strictured by Shruti strongly as you can
see.

You are entitied to your views, of course, but debate, ordered by
decency, is certainly on topic for the Dvaita list; whether you wish
to or not is another matter.  In general, until M K Turumella, we
never had any there.

If you have no access to my dreams, how do you know that I dream too,
or that we even mean the same thing by "dream"?  Or "dream object"?

I am not aware that there is any system except in things like
fingerprinting, where a match with a certain number of points of
congruence is expected for an analogy to be accepted.  An analogy
should correctly represent whichever aspect of the real thing it is
illustrating, that is all.  There is no need to have specific number
of congruences, etc.  And in fact, all this talk of congruences is
off-track, since I did not specify a need for such.  What I was asking
was if you were also drawing a parallel between the states of dreaming
and waking, on the one hand, and between waking and the absolute, on
the other, as you didn't like to see Guruprasad do? -- that's all.

In which case, as I was pointing out not too long ago, the universe,
and the dualistic truth, must be real as well?  Because the duality
appears, and "nAsato vidyate bhAvaH, nA.abhAvo vidyate sataH," etc.;
nothing that is not real would appear, and nothing that appears is
not real.

That's not exactly what theorem proving involves, either, strictly

Yes, they are, but they are unable to make a detailed exposition of
the concept of prAmANya-svatastva, &c.  That is what I said.

Strictly not true!  If that were the case, then there would never be
any error-correction at all.  It is only when one is in error and one
knows it, that one is motivated to change.  If it were that when one
is wrong one does not know that one is wrong, then one will forever be
wrong only.

Is there an exposition of your style of prAmANya-svatastva?  I'd be
interested, genuinely.  As far as I know, your concept is strictly
your own, not even that of your school as such.

I'm not sure what you mean here.  If that when something is present
you cannot produce evidence for its absence, you're quite right.  But
that means that that thing is present.  Period.  If on the other hand
you mean that no absence can ever be proved with evidence, then I beg
to differ.  The absence of a million dollars in my bank account is
proved by the evidence of my bank statement.

-- even if it means having to explain away "explicit" cognition of
multiplicity, and "explicit" Shruti that says otherwise?  On what
basis is there a decision to favor one explicit Shruti over another,
although it means junking the explicit experience as well?

By the way, if you see no reason, here's one: there are two kinds of
opposition of pramaaNa -- `virodha' and `pratirodha'. The former is
when something is opposed by a stronger pramaaNa, and the latter when
something is opposed by a pramaaNa of like strength.  When there is a
case of pratirodha, then both mutually-opposed pramaaNa-s tie each
other up completely and cannot be used to decide the case, which needs
recourse to some other source.  When there is virodha, the stronger
pramaaNa runs over the weaker and decides.

Now, the explicit Shruti statements supporting and denying duality are
in a position fo deadlock, for being both Shruti and of the same
worth.  Thus, the non-dualistic conclusion from Shruti is pratiruddha,
and duality is decided by the evidence of experience, which has no
barrier at all.  One cannot assert that the abheda-Shruti is
generically a stronger pramaaNa and that there is virodha, since the
opposite conclusion, that the bheda-Shruti is stronger, is also
possible with equal efficacy, and there is no way of favoring the one
over the other except due to a pre-existing bias.

Good.  Now, what I meant before was the following: since your
definition is that something which is real is "unobstructed in all
three states of time," it would come to pass that there is an
unavoidable reference to the reality of the waking state.

For it is by recourse to your waking experience *alone* that you know
that the computer did not exist prior to '94, and infer that it will
cease to exist at some unspecified future date.  But for the wakeful
experience, you have no basis for saying so at all.  And in fact, the
notion that something is, or could be, unobstructed in three states,
comes from waking experience alone, since it is not felt in dreaming
or in sleep.  That is to say, `trikAla-bAdhitatva' is itself an aspect
of wakefulness, and if wakefulness were not ultimately real, then the
concept itself would dissolve completely leaving only a void.

Also, the fact that the computer did not exist previously, or that it
will cease in future, is not a `bAdhaka' at all, since its reality in
any one state is not voided by another.  I was a child some years ago,
and am not one now, yet my childhood is not voided by my present
adulthood.

See, now, the same argument can run also in reverse: the eternality of
duality, or the multiplicity of perceivers rather, is not an
assumption as you said it was, but is rather given by Shruti.  As long
as we accept Shruti, &c., for the rest.

It stands to reason.  What reason is there to accept otherwise?  The
fullness of their d.rshhTi-experience can hardly have come in a dream,
because it is described as being very vivid, and `j~nAna-darshana' can
hardly be a dream-imagination.  Besides, it is not the seer I was
referring to, but the ordinary mortals who study Shruti.

:-)

Your sleep is very unique, I must say.  That, however, seems to
conflict with the idea that the "I" is the only thing common between
the three states.  At least in your case, Shruti also is in common.

Sometimes I get the impression that I could fly better while dreaming
than awake; that's hardly the point.

-- which, as I said, is a straightforward conflict with the notion
that only the "I" is common to all three.

It matters because unless there is a real entity needing moksha, there
cannot be moksha at all.  Just as unless there is a real person
needing food, there cannot be a meal.  Thus, any path that does not
consider the mumukshu to be real is not a path to moksha at all.
(This of course is a more explicit argument against the Buddhists, but
a valid point in this context nonetheless.)

One does not "surrender" by asserting one's identity with the one to
whom one surrenders.  If I were to lose in a war and surrender to the
victor, I in fact should not even assert likeness with him, for that
would result in bad consequences for me.  If there is no separate
reality, there is no surrender either, given the very notion of
surrender.
