       We are neither "dreaming" nor are we ever "wakeful."
       "We" are not really here at all.
      Only the Self is present
      As Maharshi has said,  the so-called dream world and the waking world
are                              exactly the same.
           One just SEEMS to last longer.

         But the "characters" on the screen that triggered an emotional
response were only flickering lights.
        The reality supporting the illusion was still only the unbroken screen.

            Obviously, the analogy has its limitations.

     No, not different.  The perceiver and the perceived are one and the same.
