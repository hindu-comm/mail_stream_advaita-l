This isn't ad hoc stuff.  On the contrary, it's quite relevant.  The
criticism is that I'm debating without the support of sastras.  I agree
that this is the formal recognized method--valid for most; it's not
indispensible though.  Not every 'documented' word can be trusted anyway.
The only real barometer we have is our own gut that tells us what's what...
and its reliability can only be forged over time (can there be any other
way?).

Maybe the need is to throw away the books!  Some people are ready for this.
Go into solitary forest like the external sanyasin.  Pull out all the
security plugs and the break down the shields and barriers that keep us
protected from the ************ of the Atman.  This was my way for 7 years
on a virgin wild island in a river.  No need to elaborate.
