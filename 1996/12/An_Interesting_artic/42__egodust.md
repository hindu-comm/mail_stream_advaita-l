Re this seemingly unresolvable ancient battle of ideologies:

Contrary to what many believe, egoic release (Self-realization)
doesn't have to involve a long, drawn out philosophical process.
It doesn't have to be something that might arrive in some distant
tomorrow.  It can very well happen spontaneously, here and now.
Merely the right measure of insight could be enough to prompt
it--*beyond* the exotic desires/preconceptions of the clever Mind.

Therefore, contemplating the sahaja state of the jivanmuktha
isn't without purpose--as the method of advaita purports to apply.
In fact, it can loose the straightjacket from our otherwise bleak
and cold system of relative logic, the nature of which tends
to stay the course of a linear life-conception: the restrictive
self/not-self continuum.  Yet, as the value of *any* means to an
end is discardable (as both the dvaitamarga as well as advaitamarga
are), the ultimate result is the lone reality--the rest is dependant
on personal preference and therefore purely arbitrary.  As such:

When the awareness is sunk into the Heart finally and completely,
what debates are possible?  What concepts, precepts or tenets
are left to settle upon in contrast to the raw, nir-guna Being?
What can possibly stand alongside this satchidananda, to hold us
captive for even a moment's challenge?

namaskaar.

If you would like to come off the gross digression and unrelated
declarations, and have a reasoned, step-by-step discussion, let me
know.  There is no meaningful way of discussing anything if you run
off the topic and make your own ad hoc postulations whenever
convenient.

When One has not experienced the so called "mukti", how can one describe it ?


There is no need to fight or argue on this unless it has a good intention of
getting to know more & later decide upon which is "mukti prada" ~jnana. If a
person has prejudice on something always & perhaps always gets biased with
one's own illicit thought of imagination about mukti, let him follow his own
ideology & experience the fruits himself. Arguing with out any references is
just not a vedantic way. Making ad hoc & unintented debates without quoting
necessary verses to support is like some Baba or modern saints who preach
stupidity.

I beg your pardon  for making such a straight forward ans on this.

So pls debate systematically or else stop beating the same old bush.
debates should really make some sense.I stand on Shrisha's comment on this.
Nevertheless, I am not baised with dvaita also.


Kind regards,

Rama
