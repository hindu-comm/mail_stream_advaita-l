          No.  I'm suggesting that "everything" is "happening" at the same
"time."

We can't really answer if "we're" not really "here."

The Self is "what is."  It is one without a second.

That's true.  Only the Self is present.

   Neither the "dream world" nor the "walking world" is real.
   Reality is "that which persists."      The Self.

Things are not what they seem.

The point is that, in a good movie, we don't experience the screen.  We only
experience the movie.  We are mesmerized by an illusion.

No, it's basically limited.  Words can never describe the pure consciousness
that is the Self.
As they say, the "map is not the territory."  Well, in this case, there are
a lot of so-called "maps" but the real irony is that there's no "territory"
that's "out there" that can be ventured into.  The Self is fully present.

To continue with this limited analogy, you are the infinte screen that's
only pretending to be one of the characters that's being projected upon it.

The essence of the Self is to be what it is
                                           by pretending to become what it
isn't.
