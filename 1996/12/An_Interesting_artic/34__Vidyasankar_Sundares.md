In the recent past, I have been trying to keep away from dvaita vs.
advaita debates on any forum, including the newsgroups, srv and srh. The
main reason is that these debates are endless. We do not agree on
fundamentals, and I see little point in constantly debating peripheral
issues. I do not think this is the right forum for such a debate. Nor do I
think that the dvaita list is a forum for the debate, and so I've
refrained from even subscribing to it.

However, Shrisha does have a point in that we were the first to discuss
amongst ourselves what was said on the other list. So he is entitled to be
heard, but I do not want to have this discussion continue beyond a point,
so this is going to be my first and last response to Shrisha. So, here
goes,

I admit I did say something not very charitable about Mr. Guruprasad. But
then, I am entitled to my expectations of the philosophical capabilities
of mathematicians. None of the mathematicians I know have given me reason
to think otherwise. Shrisha's comparison of all mathematicians to the
Unabomber is, on the other hand, insulting to mathematicians in general,
and Mr. Guruprasad in particular. I hope you didn't mean the implied
threat seriously, Shrisha. However, I find it interesting that you think
what blew up in the face of the Unabomber's victims was somehow the
victims' mistake.

Here we go again. Confounding peripheral issues without agreeing on
fundamentals. In advaita, the unreal and the illusory are two
different categories. Within the framework of advaita, however faulty you
think it is, you cannot find fault with an advaitin saying that a dream
object is "illusory". He does *not* mean unreal. Find fault with the
framework of the advaitic criteria of reality, but please do not impute
unreality (the way you understand it) to an object that the advaitin says
is illusory.

Of course, I am assuming here that Madhava did keep the category of the
asat and the mithyA separate in his discussion. But please do remember
that neither what Madhava says, nor what I say, is final, as far as
advaita is concerned. Go back to the original bhAshyas and vyAkhyas of the
acknowledged masters, if you feel we are misrepresenting advaita.

svata: pramANa, parata: apramANa, my dear Shrisha. We advaitins do not
like to leave the perceiver out of the analysis of perception. When I say
something about dream objects, I am saying something about the dreamer
also. Certainly I can talk about dreamers and about dream objects, because
I myself do have dreams! I am only admitting that I have no access to your
dreams. But I do not doubt that you dream too, and that your dreams
presumably have objects in them.

No, because there is no proper analogy to brahman. We do not insist that
analogies have some given number of points of congruence, because the
exact number of congruences I want to use in an analogy is up to me. You
cannot insist that an analogy has to have, say, nine points of congruence,
and find fault with my analogy because it has only eight. In your
opinion, I might be rather poor at coming up with analogies, but then,
hey, I am no Kalidasa.

So long as the universe exists, yes, vide "yatra tu dvaitamiva bhavati".
We advaitins do not deny that duality appears in the perceived universe,
do we?

What David Hilbert did has no relevance to a discussion on dvaita and
advaita. Scientific theorem solving assumes that any statement is in need
of proof by other statements of known truth value. The vedAntic assumption
is radically different.

Furthermore, I would like to point out that we advaitins never leave the
experiencer out of any analysis of experience. When we say, "valid by
itself", we always mean that "valid by itself for the perceiver". It gets
tiresome to repeat "for the perceiver" everytime, so we leave it out. I
was after all writing the above on an advaita list, where everybody knew
my assumptions, presumably. I honestly did not know that you were a list
member too. I will be more careful in my choice of words the next time
around.

This does not follow, because we see that men are constantly correcting
their own errors. However, so long as they are under error, they never
know it. They assume that they are right. Quite obviously, you and I mean
very different things by pramANa svatastva. I would appreciate it if you
kept *my* meaning in mind when you respond to a statement *I* make. Do
not impose your meanings on my statements.

No cognition, but Sruti. "yatra tvasya sarvam AtmaivAbhUt ...", "neha
nAnAsti kincana", etc. We cannot present evidence for absence of anything,
and you well know it. But you are mistaken if you think that this is a
flaw in our system. Sruti denies multiplicity in ultimate reality,
including multiplicity of perceivers, and we advaitins see no reason to
doubt it, or to explain away the explicit Sruti.

Apparently, for centuries, the advaitins have been defining real quite
independent of waking state realities - "trikAla-abAdhitam". This computer
I am using right now, did not exist before 1994. It will one day be thrown
away and salvaged for parts. There is no more computer then, but for the
purposes of sending you this mail, I assume that the computer exists. I do
not wish to attribute any greater reality to this computer than necessary.

It is not an assumption, Shrisha. It is given to us from Sruti. So long as
we accept Sruti as a pramANa, and a superior one to other pramANas, the
advaitins are perfectly justified. Note that what we say about the
paramArtha reality of even this pramANa does not affect a statement made
from the basis of this pramANa for the purposes of vyavahAra. If you think
this is being "pracanna bauddha", so be it. You are after all entitled to
your own opinions, however misguided they be.

You have no reason to assume that the mantra-drashTas gave us the Sruti
only from the waking state. You also have no reason to assume that I
understand Sruti only in the waking state. Many times I remember on waking
up, that I was thinking of some Sruti statement while asleep. Sometimes I
even get the impression that I understood it better while asleep than ever
before. I do not see any reason to assert that the knowledge gained from
Sruti is channelled only through the waking state. At least for me, it is
channelled through waking, dreaming and sleeping states.

A reiteration of the threat, eh? Anyway, since you cannot even add two
numbers, by your own admission, I am not very afraid. If Mr. Guruprasad is
going to read this sometime, I hope he takes my comments in good humor.
After all, you are the one imputing tendencies of the Unabomber to him,
not me.

Vidyasankar

ps. Note, this *is* my only response on this thread. To ensure that I
don't get sucked into further discussion, I promise not to say anything
bad (or for that matter, anything at all) about tattvavAda or tattvavAdins
till the 5th of January, 1997, i.e. for a whole month. I hope saying
something good about advaita/advaitins does not automatically mean
something bad about dvaita/dvaitins.
