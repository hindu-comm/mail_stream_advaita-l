Or vice versa, unfortunately.

I beg your pardon?  I don't understand.

Quick note: the "dvaitee" does not hold any state "in special regard,"
and would in fact completely deny that there is a difference between
the states as such (in being different states of reality rather than
different states of cognition of a continuous reality).

Again, I'm sorry if I'm a little dense, but I don't gather your point
here.

Ishvara is not subject to dreaming or deep sleep at all, is He?  But
perhaps you meant something else?

Sorry for sounding continually stupid, but we're clearly on different
wavelengths here.  I don't seem to catch what you're saying, and some
of the terminology/paradigms used ("involutionary arc of the cycle"?)
is completely unrelated to anything I've ever seen.

...uhhh, and so?

-- which, rather unfortunately, is opaque from both to me.

Hello,

First I should say that it looks like an interesting discussion is
occurring here without the usual loonies who end up ruining
discussions in the newsgroups.

Having said that, I feel I should point out that there is a problem
with cross-posting messages to more than one mailing list.

The problem is that people have a choice of which mailing lists they
subscribe to, sometimes that decision is based on the number of
members in the list and sometimes it is based on the people who are
members of the list.

When one crossposts a message to two (or more) lists, then everyone in
both lists is *effectively* subscribed to both lists, simply because
subsequent followups also end up on both lists.

Thus, people lose the choice of what size list they are subscribing to
and which people they receive messages from.

So, I would request that - after this current discussion fades out -
that no more crossposting occur.


Thanks,

Ken                       <*>
