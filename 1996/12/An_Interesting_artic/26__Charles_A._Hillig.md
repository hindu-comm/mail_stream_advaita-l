     Any attempt to seek a time-based, linear "causality" ignores the fact
that cause and effect are, quintessentially, the same thing because they
"both" arise simultaneously.

     However, just because I see an intense movie during the waking state
and then dream about that movie at night, it still doesn't mean that the
movie is "real" or that the characters and action really, in fact, occurred.

     The variety of dream-objects manifesting as part of the dream was,
seemingly, only triggered by the illusory variety of objects that appeared
as the movie on the screen.

     But didn't the screen, itself, still remain seamless, undivided, and whole?

                                        With Blessings,

                                                 Chuck Hillig
