Namaste.
        I think the quotation was by Swami Lakshmanjoo. He is very well known
and was the successor of the lineage started by Abhinavagupta, the
exponent of the Kashmir Shaivism. Many people even regarded him as an
incarnation of Abhinavagupta. He lived in Kashmir and attained
mahasamadhi in late 1991. Shortly before that, he appointed an american
teenager, Viresh Hughes (who was born in India, got his upanayam
performed by Lakshmanjoo, and lives in california) as his successor.
        Lakshmanjoo was not only recognized as a jnani, but was widely
known as a scholar in sanskrit. His remarkable knowledge of sanskrit and
his photographic memory helped in the translation of various kashmir
shaivism texts which are available today. A couple have been published by
the SUNY press, NY. One can find his name mentioned in varied books like
'Zen flesh, Zen bones,' books on Kundalini by Lilian Silburn besides
contempary KAshmir Shaivism books.
        A brief biography of Abhinavagupta can be found in
