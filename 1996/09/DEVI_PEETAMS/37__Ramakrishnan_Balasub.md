Looks like there are many, many "traditions" about the last days of sha.nkara.
According to some of the literature (which you sent me) there are also
traditions that he spent his last days in Kerala and Chidambaram!

Looks like everyone wants to be associated with sha.nkara one way or the other.
I read in the dvaita list that there is a "tradition" that Madhva defeated
vidyasha.nkara (a Sringeri pontiff) who they claim is a reincarnation of
sha.nkara. I think the advaitins themselves claim no such connection between
sha.nkara and his successor at Sringeri. There seems to be no "tradition" that
Madhva defeated some re-incarnation of raamanuja. Just goes to show how much
sha.nkara has become ingrained in the Indian psyche, I guess.

Ramakrishnan.
