        However, even in the olden days, a young person used to work for
a Guru, doing some household duties. This also is some form of payment, if
you look at it. The validity of a guru may not be judged whether money is
required or not (sometimes, all that is requested is a hour's pay or
less). And no one will refuse to teach you if you genuinely are short of
money. Since Devi is your Ishta Devata, you may consider one of the
various Kundalini yoga schools (many are free of cost).
        Secondly, there are numerous gurus, including direct disciples of
nisargadatta maharaj, ramana maharshi, ramakrishna, lahari mahasya and
many others. Most of them don't request any money at all but some of them
do. After all these Gurus are just external manifestations of your Self
only.
        Finally, as Nisargadatta Maharaj put it there are lot of worthy
Gurus, but very few worthy disciples who are ready.

Namaste.

I find that this is one of the most misunderstood concepts these days.

I think the problem is that a fake guru is indeed after your money.

Thus, one becomes conditioned that money equals fake.

However, organizations that develop around real gurus do have
legitimate reasons for charging money - namely costs.

Isn't studying with a guru education?

Having said all this, I haven't come across any true guru who doesn't
have some sort of free access, whereby one can have darshan without
paying a fee (even if their organization has other courses that do
require a fee).


Namaskar,

Ken
