                                          Om Namo Bhagavati
Krishnam Vande Jagadgrum!

Namste!      Thank you all for responding to my query and advising me to seek
a Guru.

I am looking for a qualified Guru.  I heard from my elders that when a
student is ready the guru himself comes to him.   Present day guru's want
money upfront and I have no intention of going to them.   Not that I can not
pay them but it is a principle. Once money is involved the next question is
how much.  I am disgusted of the thought paying some one even before the
first lesson.  It is understandable in normal education not in spiritual
pursuits.

I wish there is some one of the calibre of Bhagawan Ramana Maharishi or
Siridhi Saibaba.   Perhaps one day I can find somebody until such time I feel
Devi and Lord Krishna are my Gurus.  When they showered so much grace on to
me to have all these experiences they will teach me what I need to know.

Thanks again.

Regards


                                                                     Nageswar
