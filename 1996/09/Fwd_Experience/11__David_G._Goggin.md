Dear Chelluri Nageswar Rao,

  I had a similar experience when I was a teeneager.  I knew beyond a
shadow of a doubt it was a "true" experience, or rather an experience
of the Truth, but I had no background to understand it.  It certainly
didn't fit within my conventional western religious education.

  I've spent the rest of my life trying to understand what happened in
it's fullness.  Each year I've been led to deeper understandings about
it.  It seems to me I was shown my goal, my destination, and have
since been slowly shown the steps necessary to travel there such that
I can eventually be there forever.

  I wouldn't dare try to explain it to you.  I would guess that divine
insight will reveal the full "explanation" of it to you in time.  Only
then will you feel the deep satisfaction of "knowing" the answer in
the way that you really want to know it.

  I will say that I've spent the last 30 years searching and
following the Truth of that experience.  If I had it to do all over,
the only thing I would change is that I would pursue it even more
fervently.

Wishing you all the best,
--

PS:  I don't know much about many of the Indian religious customs and
religions, but find them fascinating.  Would you mind terribly telling
me a little more about the rituals you performed -- on or off the list
as you think is appropriate.  Thanks!
