  I had a similar experience outside a small temple in Maharashtra, a
few hours from Bombay.  I pondered it for a long time.

  There have been a few times I felt I had "missed an opportunity"
because I didn't recognize the divine interaction as it took place.
But I know it's not really the special encounters or the exciting
experiences that matter most.  It's the consistent devotion and
surrender in my heart that, as She watches, brings out her love
and affection.

  BTW, I had never heard of the Devi Mahatmyam before, but recently
bought a translation of it -- found it hauntingly beautiful. Now I
understand what attracted me to it, it's the love of her devotees.
Thanks for sharing your experiences -- for many reasons, but one of
them being so I could understand my attraction to this hymn.

  It's great to get to see one's close relationship with the Divine,
then the challenge is to live up to that relationship.  Best wishes!
