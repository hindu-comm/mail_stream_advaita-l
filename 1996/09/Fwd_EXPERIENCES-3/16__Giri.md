        Actually, Devi Herself says so about the place. I refer you to
the 38 chapter of book 7 of DBP, where Devi lists all important places in
response to this query by the Himalayas 'O Devi ! Describe the places on
this earth that are prominent, sacred, and worth visiting and which Thou
likest best.' Devi replies, 'All the places that are on this earth are
Mine..I am however telling you this [sacred places] out of My affection to
Bhaktas...[list of places] ... The kamakhya is the excellent place where
the Devi Mahamaya dwells. There is no other place better than this.'

[DBP, of course, refers to the devi bhagavata purana]

        Many such incidents can be found in tiruvilaiyadal where Lord
Shiva 'plays' with His devotees. Even in periyapurana, there is an
incident when a devotee is sleeping in the temple. A foot touches his
head and awakes to see a brahmin sleeping. The devotee requests (somewhat
angrily) the brahmin to remove his feet. The incident happens again
within a few minutes. The devotee gets angry and asks the brahmin 'Why
are constantly keeping your foot on my head ?' The brahmin says 'Because
you requested so. Don't you recognize me ?.' Saying such, He disappears.
Such is the grace of Lord Shiva and Shakti. But, sometimes, even the best
of devotees are not able to recognize it.

praNaam.
