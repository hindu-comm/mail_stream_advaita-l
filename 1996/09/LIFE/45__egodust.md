Have to agree with you also.  The dvaitic delusion that the Mind is real at all
is a phenomenon with no more impact than the night-time dream of "reality"
confronting the subject...all spun by Mind.  In the earlier stages this Beast
needs be acknowledged--even if to humor the apparent victim.  Yet there's just
NO VICTIM at all.  This is why there can only be jnanis...in fact, only One
Jnani: That ParaBrahmam.  Anything else is a hare's horn growing on the chin of
a housecat!

peace. peace. peace.
namskaaram.

I think that this is where you start to cross the line between the
beneficial aspects of reading the philosophies of many different
spiritual groups and some of the adverse aspects.

IMHO, I think it is good to read books on philosophy from many
different groups in order to be able to get a three-dimensional
perspective about Brahman and Maya, etc.

However, I think it is best to avoid *specific advice* as to what to
do and not do, that doesn't come from one's own spiritual teacher.

I know that many spiritual teachers told different disciples to do
different things - depending on their temperament.

The specific quotes above are a good example - I've heard masters tell
some disiciples to read more books and then tell other disicples to
throw away all their books.

I certainly know some people who are too hung up on the intellectual
aspects of religion, and other people whose many problem is that they
have very little intellectual philosophical knowledge.

PS  Indeed one of the advantages of Hinduism over Buddhism is that the
concept of Satchidananda (existence-consciousness-bliss) is a lot
easier to comprehend than the concept of the void.


Cheers,

Ken                         <*>
