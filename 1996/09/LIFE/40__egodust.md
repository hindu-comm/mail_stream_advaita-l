Rewind the question to its source: "Who is having the doubt?"

Firstly, 'who' is the product of the trumped-up 'I' (the 'I'-thought,
which is the Maker of Mind).
Secondly, 'doubt' is the product of this same Mind.

Therefore, this *rumored* ego-Mind is the thief of one's equilibrium.

How to treat this "problem"...?

***********

'Doubts' are dreadful gadgets of maya fabricated by MindWorks, Ltd.
It's best to sneak into the factory late at night when nobody's around,
plant a 10lb chunk of dynamite insight under the giant file cabinets of
historic judgements, light a 10 minute fuse of contemplation and,
without regrets of any conceivable allurement, walk away without
ever looking back...knowing full well the ensuing explosion [ever was,
is, and will be] That Silence Unchained in the tenhundred directions
within the Unknowable Itself...

namaste.
