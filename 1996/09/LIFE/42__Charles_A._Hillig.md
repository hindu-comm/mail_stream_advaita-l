The Silence is NOT  "chained."  IT is ever present.
Ten minutes?  One minute?   The SELF is unbounded  and non-linear.  It is
beyond limitations of time and space.

The biggest so-called problem may be to get past the delusion that  there IS
a "separate Mind" that's creating all of this mischief.

The "factory" will continue to, seemingly, "do" whatever IT, seemingly, "does."
Your discovery that the "lake" that you see in the desert is really only a
mirage is NOT going to make this "lake" disappear.   But, after you realize
that it's not real, you won't be running after it as before.  You may not
really, seemingly, awaken FROM the illusion as much as TO the illusion.

     Spiritual "progress" is impossible.  There's nothing that  "you" can
"do" to, seemingly, get to a place where you already exist as the Absolute
SELF.   Believing that there is, however, provides the momentum for you to
go out looking for  "The Truth."   However, your very act of seeking only
validates your delusion that you are, quintessentially, different from what
it is that you are seeking.

     Let go of struggle, do-ership and attainment.  Let go of it all!

          (and then let go of "letting go.")   Only the SELF is present.

                         With Blessings,
                                          Chuck Hillig

Hello,

However, we should remember that when we are not aware of or do not
remember the principles of Advaita, then this action of the Mind is
exactly that which eventually (sometimes a very long 'eventually')
brings us back.

( The following insight is paraphrased from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; one
of his best contributions. )

The nature of the Mind is to be constantly in motion, always seeking
something better.   The advantage of this is that it keeps us from
being satisfied with less than the Absolute.   Boredom is simply the
mind being dissatisfied.

The practice of meditation, ie contact with the Absolute, eventually
tames the mind by satisfying it.


Namaskar,

Ken
