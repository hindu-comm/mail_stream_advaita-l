namaste, My respects to you all,

        I recently read in the biography of Milarepa that it
is difficult to think of concepts like void ( or absolute),
so better to get the grasp of Doctrine of Karma. If that is
clearly grasped, it will help us from getting entangled and
lead us further.

        He also asks the disciples not to read a lot books
on philosophy and read only biographies of great saints.
