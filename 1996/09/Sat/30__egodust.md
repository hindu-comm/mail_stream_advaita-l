According to the individual's understanding/development, the idea that the
Mind is rooted in illusion may or may not apply.  The dvaitin considers it
real (as well as being *distinct* from brahman).  The student of advaita is
instructed to regard it as mayavic.  Whereas a veteran advaitin realizes
that [even the temporal affair of] the Mind *ISN'T* different from brahman.
Adi Sankara's formula is clear on this.  The stipulation involving the maya
aspect arises if/when the perception of separativeness is considered real
(viz: if one considers the works of the thoughtWorld to be something *other*
than brahman).

The important factor in all this philosophical jockeying (which plants
vital seeds in the antahkarana) is to enable the notion of ego to forget
its phantasm, whereupon its Source will effortlessly radiate.  The ego
is non-different from its Source UNTIL it IMAGINES its limit.  This is
the Fall of jiva from Grace.  Yet, WHO is it that falls?

namaste.
