Concur.  That which is real, persists.  The space-time continuum can be
regarded as a fragmentation of reality insofar as it represents a modification
of the Absolute Attributeless.  The simplest barometer is undoubtedly the
factor of change as it applies to what is witnessable: [incredibly] that
envelops Everything [conceivable].  (Note: the key word here is 'conceivable'--
which alludes to the ongoing mental Play of Phenomena...this is a strong hint
in the direction of the significance of the blown out root 'I'-thought {viz.
nirvana}--which is ALREADY the natural substratum of What IS.  Again only the
Veil of Avidya needs be lifted.  Nothing *new* to acquire!)

namaste.
