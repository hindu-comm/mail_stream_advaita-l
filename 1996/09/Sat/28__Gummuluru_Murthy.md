Well described.

Sri Sankara's writings are full of the distinction between Reality
and illusion. The one I am reading presently is the one in
Upadesa Sahasri 19.8 which says

" ....
  vikalpitam caapy asad iti avasthitam "

Everything created by the mind is non-existent or an illusion.

I trust I am interpreting it properly and in context.
