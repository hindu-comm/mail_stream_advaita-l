Illusion ........................... Reality
Any fragmentation of ............... The Totality
Assuming Ignorance of .............. Omnipresent Wisdom
      (ajnana)                             (jnana)
Dwelling in
   Separative Identity from ........ The Absolute Being
      (ahamkar)                            (brahman)
Belief in avidya
      rebelling against ............ sahajatmanishta
                                           (natural inherent
                                            true Self Being)

******************

The column on the left is not even a dream that never existed.
Its "manifestation" is the result of hypnotic suggestions.
Its "dissolution" is affected by disbelieving the commands of avidya.

We ARE the Light; only the veil obscuring It needs be lifted.
Jnana is never won; ajnana is only lost.

praNaam.
