Could you please make that your last but one? Thanks. I have some questions,
which I should have made clear the first time itself.Anyway, I'll just stick to
the point:

I didnot forget that. My point is that RamaNa was clearly specifying *two*
"ways". I mean:

It's not clear! (I mean the fact that the *only* path is self-enquiry,
admitting that "complete surrender" is synonymous with "realization"; at least
from the quote that Giri has provided)

quote from Giri's posting-------

Maharshi : Why do you want to know of Brahman apart from yourself ? The
scripture says "You are that" The Self is intimate to you and you can not
indeed be without the Self. Realise it. That is the Realisation of Brahman also.
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Disciple : But I am unable to do it. I am too weak to realise my Self.
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Maharshi : In that case surrender yourself unreservedly and the Higher
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
power will reveal Itself.

Disciple : What is unconditional surrender ?

Maharshi : If one surrenders oneself there will be no one to ask
questions or to be thought of. Either the thoughts are eliminated by
holding on to the root thought 'I' or one surrenders oneself
unconditionally to the Higher power. These are the only two ways for
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Realisation.
^^^^^^^^^^^^
---------------------

Why the "two ways"? RamaNa in fact explicitly states surrender as an alternate
path : "in that case...", i.e, if self-enquiry is not possible. Note: I don't
mean "bhakti" but "sharaNagati", in the sense of what RamaNa says,"unconditional
surrender to the Higher Power".

If the disciple were capable of self-enquiry, he wouldn't surrender in the
first place. "Surrender" leads to "revelation" ("the higher power will reveals
itself") and "self-enquiry" leads to "realization" ("realize the self").
Revelation and realization may be the same thing: but clearly, there are two
PATHS to it, as RamaNa himself says so _explicitly_.

This might make things clearer:

 clear:

 "I".

ok then:

1. self-enquiry leads to realization.
2. "partial surrender" also leads to "complete surrender" (realization).

There are two paths then: "self-enquiry" for the "meditative" disciples and
"surrender" for the "un-meditative"; the ONE goal being "realization".

Unless you contend that "surrender" = "self-enquiry", which is hardly credible,
especially as RamaNa himself says,"In that case...surrender", when the disciple
states his own lack of ability towards self-enquiry.

To be absolutely clear: surrender is _not_ "neti, neti" or "locating the source
of the `I' thought", which is otherwise termed "self-enquiry". Surrender is,
as RamaNa says,"surrendering oneself unconditionally to the Higher Power."

**Where is the question of a "Higher Power" in Self-enquiry?**

You said that Ramakrishna espoused average(Vishishh. & advaita). And I believe
that it is advaita, that's all.

And when you said,"RamaNa, if anything, was an advaitin..." all made me think
that "Ramakrishna is not an advaitin".

What's more, repeatedly saying that Shankara and RamaNa were on one side and
Ramakrishna was "contradicting both" made me feel that way.

Could you please quote from the talks? Because this is very unclear: why
two words "bhakti" and "GYAna" at all? It seems like erasing the word "bhakti"!

Anyway, it still feels like "surrender" and "self-enquiry" are different,
though the *realization* is identical.

Sorry!

I'll make up for that :-) :

I remember a book on the Shankara dig-vijayam, which said,"At such-and-such
place, Shankara remained immersed in Samadhi". Why are the time and place
specified? I'll try and get the reference.

And of course, Hastaamalaaka was supposed to be "always in samadhi, hence he
couldn't apply his mind to mundane matters of taking care of a maTh, etc., so
sureshvara took care of it". Which again suggests that one need not "always be
in samadhi", for the other disciples did take care of the MaThs, Shankara did
establish the MaThs, etc.
