        That's true. Lord Krishna in Bhagvad Gita says 'One in thousand
strive for self-realization, and among them, one in thousand understands
me' or something to that effect in 7.03 (?).
        However, without evil, where is good  and vice-versa ? Further, I
would contend that this seeming duality is Her lila, and instead of
trying to understand why this Lila is enacted, we should instead try to
find out who we really are.

        I differ. Shankara, Jesus etc lived short lives (30-40) but then
"modern" swamijis like Yogananda, Ramana, Nisargadatta etc lived longer
lives [in their physical bodies]. I think this is consistent with the
average life-expectancy of that era.  Hence, it is my contention (need not
be right) that the life-expectancy depends on karma etc and not
necessarily on punya etc.
