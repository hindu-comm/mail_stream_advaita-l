  It is not only humans who have bad qualities. Animals too have bad qualities
  but they are more or less determinate. This is evident if we watch wild life
  channels on TV where the law of the jungle is shown.

  The discriminatory power of humans acts as a double edged sword, leading to
  either vices or virtues as you have noted above. Both virues and vices exceed
  those of animals.

  I am not sure if short life means lesser accumulated bad karma. Short life
 itself
  could be a result of bad karma. Because the process of birth and death is
 itself a
  painful one, is'nt is better to live long ( with good health of course )?

Namaskar,
Suresh.
