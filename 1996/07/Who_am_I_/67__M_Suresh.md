  Ramana Maharishi differs here. According to him we should not even
  strive to reach the parmaatma.  One sould either find out the "I" which is
  the source of all thoughts by enquiry or we should surrender everything to
  the lord including the desire for salvation and redemption from the
  birth-death cycle.

  Even Good deeds done with expectation of salvation will put one in the cycle
  of birth-death after spending many years in heaven. I think it is there
  somewhere in the Bhagavad Gita.

  Action without attachment alone can grant salvation. I suppose if one becomes
  detached one will automatically tend to do good deeds because good deeds tend
  to unify, and god is the ultimate unification, and as one becomes more
 detached
  one gets more anchored in god.

  I think salvation can be got from the human birth alone. What about from other
  worlds? I think it can be got after taking birth in this world only.

  Quite true.

  Your argument holds good if salvation is to take place in this birth itself.
  But usually virtues/sins remain after death requiring more births+deaths. So
 even
  if one dies early he will be born again anyway to work out his praarabdha
 karma
  ( karma held in reserve ). Also early death ( Akaala mrithyu ) itself can be
  a result of past sin which would make it not good.

Namaskar,
Suresh.
