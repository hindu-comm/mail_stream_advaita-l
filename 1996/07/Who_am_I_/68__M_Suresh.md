  I was saying that the desire for salvation should not be there.

"no self centered desires" in your quote above would include "no desire for
salvation" since desire for salvation is a kind of self-centered desire. Jiddu
Krishnamurthy says that truth is not a reward. I see no contradiction. By
 surrender
I did not mean letting go of all actions. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita
that inaction is impossible for the mind.
