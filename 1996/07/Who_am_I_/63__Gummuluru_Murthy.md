The first verse of Atma Bodha by Sankara ends up with "MumukshUNA
mapekshyeya mAtmabodho vidhEyatE"

Sankara, in teaching Atma Bodha says that it is meant for people who (in
addition to having other qualifications) seek mumUksha.  I am not sure if
such an apeksha for mumUksha can be considered a desire.

I agree that my original posting might have given the impression that we
do good deeds with the objective of getting away from the cycle of births
and re-births.
What I mean to say is "You seek knowledge of the Self. You become a
sadhaka. Then good deeds flow from you."
