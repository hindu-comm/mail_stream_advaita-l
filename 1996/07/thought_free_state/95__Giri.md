Namaste. Please refer to page 352 of Talks with Ramana, third edition.

'The bliss of peace is too good to be disturbed. A man fast asleep hates to
be awakened and ordered to mind his business. The bliss of sleep is too
enthralling to be sacrificed to the work born out of thoughts. The
thought-free state is one's primal state and full of bliss. Is it not
miserable to leave such a state for the thought ridden and unhappy one ?
        If one wants to abide in the thought-free state, a struggle is
inevitable. One must fight one's way through before regaining one's primal
state. If one succeeds in the fight and reaches the goal, the enemy, namely
the thoughts, will all subside in the Self and disappear entirely. The
thoughts are the enemy. They amount to the creation of the universe. In
their absence there is neither the world or God or creator. The bliss of the
Self is the single Being only.'

Hello,

A request -

When citing books ( such as "Talks with Ramana Maharshi" ) please note =
any
other position indications besides page numbers, since different editions=
 have
different page numberings.

For example, Talks with RM has section numbers and conversation dates.   =
Other
books have chapter numbers.

If the book has none of these, then give the total number of pages (for
example, "page 325 of 788 total" - which then allows one to calculate =
that it
is 41% of the way through the book, so since my edition has 615 pages, it
should be at or near page 254).

ALSO, I already have several RM quotes on the thought-free state, so no =
more
are needed.


Thanks,

Ken                       <*>

IAN: I agree.

I believe that the following statements describe the nature of states:

        A) All states of experience are not other than the Self.
        B) No state is more truly the Self than any other.
        C) Some people prefer one state over another.

I believe all three statements are true.

The state of active thought and emotion is naught but the Self, since
the mind is nothing but the awareness which illuminates it.
That awareness, or ground of being, is the Self.

When we see a stainglass window we think we see physical glass, but in
fact, all we actually see is the light that carries information to our
eyes. In the same way, when we see the mind and its emotions, we think
we see a mind and emotions but in fact all we see is the Self.
