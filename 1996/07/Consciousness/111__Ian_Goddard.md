IAN: We can solve this as follows:

   Show me a universe free from a nervous system. You cannot.

   Show me a nervous system free from an external universe. You cannot.

Logic therefore dictates that we cannot establish a division between
A) a nervous system and B) not-nervous system -- i.e., an external
area. Thus the two are not-two. Nervous system and not-nervous
system are necessary features of one another, such that the
external universe is a part of a nervous system, thus the
whole universe is 100% nervous system.


Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = (A + ~A)

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A
