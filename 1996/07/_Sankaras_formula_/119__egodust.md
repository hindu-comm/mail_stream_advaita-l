I had mentioned it in an earlier post pertaining to an item we were
discussing.  Here it is again, comapared to the boolean equation:

Sankara's advaitic formula:

1) Brahman is the only reality.
2) The world* is maya.
3) Brahman is the world*.

* the world is technically manosohamidam (manas is mind; soh is saguna
brahman or God the Creator; aham is the jiva or ego; idam is the
world-appearance).

***********

A = (A + ~A)
corresponds to
3 = (1 + 2)

key: 3 is the parabrahmam (Absolute One, Without-a-Second)
     1 is nirguna brahman (noumenal Absolute)
     2 is saguna brahman (phenomenal Absolute)

The popular zen koan is very similar, although it also alludes to
transcending logic, which is the essential thrust of the koan method
and rinzai zen. To wit:

              A is A, therefore A is not A.

(Note that it is specifically written 'not A' and not 'not-A', which
indicates that it suggests an overthrow of logic rather than a strict
advaitic formula.  In which case both ways make advaitic sense, no?)

Sounds worthwhile to link.
