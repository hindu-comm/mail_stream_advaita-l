Thanks for your (as usual) informative post. I suddenly got a doubt whether the
latter day advaitis had a different opinion from gauDapaada in the matter of
shruti.

This is an excellent point which you note here. I am familiar only with the
taittiriiya and mahaanaaraayaNa upanishhads. I have gone through the
brihadaaraNyaka and chaandogya upanishhads, but not in detail.

Apart from the point you make about adhyaaropa and apavaada being the implicit
technique, I'd like to note a small point about the taittiriiya upanishhad. In
the bhR^iguvalli finally bhR^igu finally notes:

haa (3) vuhaa (3) vuhaa (3) vu | - rough translation is surprise, surprise,
ahamannamahamannamahamannam.h | (I am the food, I am the food, I am the food)
ahamannaado (2) ahamannaado(2) ahamannaadaH |( I am the eater, ..)

The _way_ it's recited makes a huge difference, IMO. The first verse above
especially is quite pertinent. It'd chanted in a sama veda meter, though the
upanishhad is in the kR^ishhNa yajur veda (the difference in svara's is
indicated by the 2's and 3's, yajur veda usually has only udaatta etc).

The expression of great surprise. Further "ahamannaado etc" leaves no
room for any explanation, other than the advaitic one!

I really can't imagine how these verses can be twisted into a labored dvaitic
meaning, especially given the way it is chanted. OTOH, if "a"'s and "n"'s can
be introduced to get "a"tatvamasi etc, this may be quite easy also :-).

Even I knew this :-). I remember reading that these names came about because the
ritualists emphasized the earlier parts and the vedantins the latter
(upanishhads) part. The "puurva mimaamsaka's" themselves called, their school
the miimaamsa school, and the "puurva" part was added later, am I correct?

Further, can you tell us how the dvaitins justify splitting vedic sentences in
all kinds of ways? I thought in case of any doubt the gaNapaaThi's would settle
the issue, i.e., the way they split vedic sentences is the correct way. Am I
wrong?
