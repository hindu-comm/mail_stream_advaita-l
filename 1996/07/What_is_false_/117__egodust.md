By Job, we've got it!

Now, the illusion comes into the picture whenever the blunder "...--except
those thoughts which *assume* a separation of A and not-A" happens; even of
which a further "...analysis of those thoughts..." [are really only Brahman].

Yes.  The ILLUSION of following thoughts in their isolated/separative form--
which 'isolation' is itself illusory--is what *feigns* falsehood.  Yet, upon
deeper analysis, this illusion is yet only Brahman itself.  Sankara's formula
is impeccable.
