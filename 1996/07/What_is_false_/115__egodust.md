Anything 'asserted' as being true, without considering its integral
'denial' counterpart is mayavic.

Sankara's advaitic formula [which, in boolean code, is: A = (A + ~A)]
resolves it definitively.

The Mind is Bozo the clown on acid.  To follow its theatrics as being
real--UNTO THEMSELVES--represents the earthquake that maya engineers on
the foundation of awareness.  Advaita erases the spectre of this kind
of reasonable habit: Life without philosophy.

Namaste.
