You have talked  of consciousness above.  Since we are a mirror of the
all prevading Sat-Chit-Ananda ( A side question:  how can we attribute
characteristics of  Sat-Chit-Ananda,  i.e Being-Consciousness-Bliss to
the atrribute-less Nirguna Parabrahman? ), there are 3 characteristics
in us which  distinguish us from machines.  WILL corresponding to SAT,
CONSCIOUSNESS  corresponding to  CHIT,  and  EMOTION corresponding  to
ANANDA.  Such an explanation is found in the  introduction of Bhagavad
Gita Translation by Swami Chidbhavananda.

Do you mean that normally flat-line EEG is there only when the nervous
system is not active  as in the deep-sleep,  and in turiya there is no
such dependence?
