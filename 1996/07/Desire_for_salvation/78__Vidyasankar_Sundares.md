The fitness for enquiry and belonging to a particular caste, race
or sex are not necessarily the same. Brahmin males have been considered
to be superior in Indian society, but nothing can prevent the AtmavicAra
of a so-called untouchable, if he is fit. This point is brought out
very beautifully in the manIshA-pancakam. Here Sankara says, "whether
he be a brAhmaNa or a cANDAla, I consider the one who knows Brahman
to be my guru."
