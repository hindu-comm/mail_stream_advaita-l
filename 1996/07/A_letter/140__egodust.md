It seems that many good points are found herein.  Especially the allusion
to the Buddha, who's teaching is--as far as I can tell--essentially not
different from advaita (notwithstanding the emphasis on the ideal
community of the sangha as well as certain dogmatic precepts [which
have little to do with the real thrust of what he was philosophically
conveying).

Bhagavan Sri RM makes many statements that can pull the world out from
under us, if we daringly allow them sink into our mind.  One such
statement makes reference to the popular notion that cittasuddha (satvic
mind) [as a result of the practice of samanya dharma] is an indispensible
prerequisite to moksha, refuting it utterly(!):

Major Chadwick, in A SADHU'S REMINISCENCES OF RM (p52), was talking about
World War 2 and how Bhagavan was following the course of events.."Of course
He was quite unmoved by the war and its course.  Probably He saw it as just
another turn of the wheel of karma.  He is reported to have remarked once:
'Who knows but that Hitler is a jnani, a divine instrument.' He was certainly
a man of fate.  To deny his acts as evil is wrong. [however] For a jnani
there is no good and evil.  There is only action--spontaneous activity or
the actionless-activity of the Tao.  This has no karma binding effects."

This is further clarified and substantiated if we refer back to p24:
Chadwick, evidently reporting what Bhagavan had earlier related to him:
"People judge the deeds of others as good or bad, but it is the doing itself
that matters and not the complexion of the deed.  The whole secret lies in
whether we are attached to our actions or not.  A person who spends his time
in good deeds can be much more attached to them than the so-called bad man
to his.

"Good and bad are found eventually to be only relative terms. Self enquiry
is found to be no more than the discarding of vasanas. So long as one single
vasana remains, so long must we remain unrealized."

*****

Moreover, I would say that the very programming of the idea that one must
achieve *perfect* cittasuddha before one can hope to attain moksha is quite
debilitating...and just the opposite from what really happens(!): Just like
when the fan is switched off, the blade continues to spin from [PRIOR]
momentum, so do thoughts, words and actions [being energized by prarabdha
karma] continue to occur after moksha.  It must be considered that *thought
itself* is tamorajasic; not to mention words and actions.  Technically,
chittasuddha is only permanently achieved at videhamukthi; to convince
ourselves that it is a vital prerequisite to jivanmukthi is a grave mistake.
As Bhagavan always says: "The greatest of all obstacles to freedom is the
belief that we're in bondage."

namaste.
