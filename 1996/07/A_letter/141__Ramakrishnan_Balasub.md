Actually there is also a verse which personifies the "difficulties" as the Devi
herself in the suukta,

durgaam.h devi (a symbol whose name I don't know, but can pronounce)
sharaNamaham.h prapadye sutara sitarase namaH |

That's the connection with durgaa devi. However many of the mantras are, as
claimed, about agni.

I believe that the various shiva, vishhNu cults have been dated around 700 BC or
perhaps even before. Also the word shiva seems to mean our usual shiva in the
shvetaasvatara and the kaivalya upanishads. Also quite a few names in the
rudram (niilagriiva, niilakaNTha, etc) refer to popular legends about shiva in
the puranas. Perhaps the earlier parts of the Rg Veda may be as you say.

Ramakishnan.
