I did not disagree with that, as far as vyavahaarika level is concerned.

I disagree with this statement (partly). Vidya and I had a discussion on the
list (perhaps before you came) once, with Vidya adopting a position somewhat
similar to yours.

But I guess one is convinced either one way or the other and I don't want to
repeat what I said earlier. Again the gauDapaada kaarikaa treats this subject
in some detail and various objections and counter objections are examined. Also
shaMkara states various objections in his bhaashhya (in fact all your
objections have been stated by him) and then proceeds to answer them. Swami
Nikhilananda has a good translation of the kaarikaa. He informs us that the
kaarikaa was explained to him by a direct disciple of H.H. nR^isiMha bhaaratii
swami (Sringeri), and that the disciple (I forget the name) had studied the
kaarikaa for decades. The kaarikaa was the book recommended by his guru, since
the kaarikaa explains all it's arguments based both on logic and the vedas and
hence is not a merely polemical work based on scripture. So gauDapaada explains
his position on dreams based on both the vedas and logic, independently. I found
it convincing and till now have neither been able to raise a valid counter-point
(which could change my mind), nor have I seen anyone do so.

Ramakrishnan.
