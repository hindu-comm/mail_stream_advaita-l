  I just skimmed through the logs. The amount to be read was too much to
  read in detail.

  I agree that I am doing the comparison of the dream state with the waking
  state standing back from the dream state. But on doing the comparison with
  the waking state is the waking state not found to be closer to reality?

  The incosistency is still there. For example in a dream I might climb 2
  steps and the next moment I might be somewhere else, which would not make
  any sense in the waking state. It may be that I never doubted the
  inconsistency in the dream, but still the incosistency is there. So I was
  saying that the dream state is not exactly the same as the waking state.
