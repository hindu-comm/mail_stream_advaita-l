This appears the case.  Yet the vital factor left unmentioned is that
the Mind's thoughts--although not different from the Self--if experienced
*unto themselves*, are mayavic.  When a single thought or emotion is
honored as being consequential [to one's state of Being] or summarily
paramount and exclusive, is where the popular infliction of duality enters
the picture.  (Sankara's advaitic formula, if studied and assimilated,
will clarify this stipulation, which is the cause for the egoic fantacy
of 'unenlightenment'--merely a trick perpetrated by the sensationalizing
Mind-program.)  Remember that the Mind is only a bundle of thoughts; and
since thoughts, by definition, involve *isolated* observations, they are
mayavic.  Just as the snake is not different from the rope, yet if
the rope is obscured by the hissing or writhing snake (urgency of thought
or emotion that overshadows our sahaja samadhi [natural state of Being]),
therein lies the primal disconnect.

Namaste.
