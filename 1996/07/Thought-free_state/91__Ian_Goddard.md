IAN: Does this mean there are states that are not the Self ?


Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = (A + ~A)

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A

No.

But I need a quote from Ramana Maharshi stating that the
thought-free state and the Self are one and the same.

IE this message is not for the purpose of discussion per se (not that =

quote,
so that I can e-mail it to a particular person who respects the opinion =
of RM.


Thanks,
