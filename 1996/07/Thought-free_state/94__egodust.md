Concur with all observations here; except the implication that there is no
ILLUSION of ego being tricked into a 'primal disconnect'...

Obviously there can be no evidence that 'the Self is ever disconnected from the
Self', the point is the ILLUSION that: 1) There is an ego; 2) That this ego
*believes* it is separative/unenlightened/in bondage; 3) That there *appears to
be* suffering as a result of these beliefs.

Yet there REALLY isn't an illusion!  In keeping with the quality of its
mysterious projection [somehow emanating Brahman], it can be justifiably
asserted and denied simultaneously(!)--without the need for reconciliation.
Wherefrom, the inevitable result finds the entire matter resolved in Silence.

Namaste.
