IAN: The thought that thoughts are the cause of being is, as you observe,
a false thought. There could be no initial cause of being / reality.
There could be no time prior to time, thus time never began.
Eternity is all there is right now.

IAN: If everything is relative, nothing is isolated.
Everything is relative, ergo nothing is isolated.

The Self is not isolated. If there is also no thing that is isolated,
then all things are identical to the Self, and thus any possible trace
of duality, division, or distinction is annihilated.

IAN: If there is a disconnection, there is a division and thus duality.
There is no evidence that the Self is ever disconnected from the Self.


Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = (A + ~A)

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A
