Sri Bhagavan has gone so far as to say that, in fact, anyone who so much as
visits or even looks in the direction of or, better yet, even THINKS about
Tiruvannamalai, will be liberated!

I believe that statements like this are designed to short circuit our linear
reasoning habit.

It might be interesting to point out that not all jnanis seem to possess the
same caliber/talent for teaching.  Bhagavan Sri RM was primier, as far as I
can tell, at reaching down into the subtlest recesses of human thought, and
effortlessly expose the innate fallacy and rank emptiness of its compulsive
dependence on relative judgments.  He makes it almost humorously clear how free
we *naturally* are, that all we need to do (as Dennis Waite just mentioned,
quoting Bhagavan) is "...clear out the furniture [of thoughts] from the room
[of the soul] to realize the space [Brahman] that is ALREADY there!"

Namaste.
