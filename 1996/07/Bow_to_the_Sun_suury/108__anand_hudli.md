It is customary to worship five deities daily-- GaNesha, Shiva,
Shakti, VishhNu and Suurya. This worship is called Panchaayatana
puujaa. Suurya (the Sun) occupies a special status among these
five deities -- He is the only one who is visible to the sight
of common people!

The obligatory sandhyaavandana has as one of its objectives the
worship of Suurya. Suurya is a well known Vedic deity;
numerous hymns addressed to Him are found in the Vedas. The Saura
suukta of the Rg Veda, usually chanted during abhishheka, is an
elaborate hymn of some 64 verses. The aruNa prashna of the taittiriiya-
AraNyaka is another popular hymn to Suurya. The Suurya namaskara mantras
are said to cure one of heart disease and ailments of the eyes.

Some Western scholars believe that Sun worship in India is a form of
nature worship. This view is incorrect. Suurya is usually worshipped as
a symbol of Brahman. While performing sandhyaavandana we utter the words:
"asaavaadityo brahma", which means the Sun is (a symbol of) Brahman.
By the worship of the symbol (pratiika) of Brahman, we hope to attain
Brahman.

Shriiman naaraayaNa  is to be meditated on as residing in the solar
orb. (dhyeyaH sadaa savitR^imaNDalamadhyavartii naaraayaNaH)

Worshipped in this way, He is called SuuryanaaraayaNa.

In smaarta homes, Suurya is worshipped at the start of uttaraayaNa and
dakshhiNaayana or at least on the Makara sankraanti day.
Suurya travels (apparently) to the north for six months and then
travels south for six months. The winter solstice, when He begins
the northerly course is called Makara sankraanti or the start of
uttaraayaNa; the summer solstice, when He begins the southerly course,
is called the start of dakshhiNaayana. Tomorrow (July 16th) marks the
beginning of dakshhiNaayana for this year. The discrepancy between
the Western date (June 21) and the Hindu date is due to the fact that
the Hindu system is based on fixed constellations of stars unlike
the Western system which considers the shifting of equinoxes due to
precession and nutation.

The following is a short hymn to Suurya, said to have been composed
by Shiva. Other details regarding the source of the hymn are not known
to me.
