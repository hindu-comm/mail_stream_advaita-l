The whole Mind mechanism is not to be trusted.  Whatever emotional-based
excursion it takes us on is purely arbitrary, impermanent, limited and,
thereof, fictional.  Regardless of what hard momentary conclusions it
compells us to reach--philosophical, scientific, religious, socio-political,
demographic--it is yet founded on a history of illusion, being a product of
desire for sensible entertainment.  (For who?)

The Mind is a phenomenon whose origin is an unsolvable mystery.  It is
purposeless, aimless and non-symbolic.  Our habitual propensity to follow
its ploys and magnetic insights is met with eventual vanity and waste.

The miracle of infinite idea-streams, beliefs, visions, events, dynamics,
contentions and theses, are devoid of merit except if indexed as dependently
co-arisen from the Attributeless Source.  In which case the particulars have
no discernable face.  (Therefore the Mind is unconditionally empty.)

Such conclusions that terrors, fears, tragedies, blunders, sorrows can at
all result from omissions or comissions of thoughts, words or deeds, is the
mahamaya of this [ALREADY non-existent!] Mind.

So, where are these words coming from?
(Well then, prove that they're really here!)

Repetitiously attaching ourselves to Mind's inert contractions, despite that
Freedom's door is open before us, whilst sirens, fire, cyclonic wind and
heartstopping boredom frozen in the skeleton angrily oppressing the little
piece of hallucination to finally yield its arrogance...YES!  The ultimate
truth That Thou Art is **all there ever was, is and will be!**

Where's the problem?!  What visions?  What beliefs?  What ideals, utopias?

Amen, The Pure Sky of Consciousness.
