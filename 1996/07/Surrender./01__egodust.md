How can something that is an illusion surrender or do anything else?

Remember, the ego is a mirage, it is like the snake seen in a coil of rope.

The snake cannot do anything, because it is not really there....

It is the mental body (aka the "mind") that does the surrendering.   And this
mental body is just an instrument of the Self.

It depends on how you define "complete" surrender.  If someone surrenders
completely in this moment, this is not the same as self-realization, because
there are still samskaras that pull us back into the egoic perspective.

This is what Ramana means by "mature", ie someone who has burnt all the
samskaras, who then can take the final step without being pulled back.

Once someone reaches self-realization, then of course, then "Thou" and "I" are
realized to be one.
