Namaste.

        If sharangati means complete surrender, it is ever possible for
the ego to *completely* surrender to anything without any questions ? If
done, shouldn't it be perceived that the the Surrender to Supreme is the
same as Surrender to the Self. How can the duality of 'Thou' and 'I' arise
in complete surrender ? Either everything is for the 'Thou' OR for the 'I'.
        A person who truly surrenders is a jnani and vice-versa. The Lord
says 'Established in Me, he carries out his duty indifferent to pain and
pleasure.' A jnani does his/her duty established in the Self (Atman). This
mind fails to see any difference between these states.
