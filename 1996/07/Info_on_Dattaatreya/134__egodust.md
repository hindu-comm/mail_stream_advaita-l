In addition to the Avadhutha Gita (mentioned by Ken) is the classic Tripura
Rahasya (the Mystery Beyond the Trinity [a.k.a. turiya or Fourth State]),
which is Sri Dattatreya's (Sri Narayana--incarnation of Visnu) instruction
to Parasurama.  In my opinion, it's a toss up as to which--this or Astavakra
Gita--delivers the cleanest advaitic strike to the thought-riddled mind of
the struggling jiva.

This is available from Arunachala Asrama in NY. (Tripura Rahasya, translated
by Swami R. Saraswathi)

Namaste.

Vedanta catalog lists a "Astavakra Samhita".   Is this the same text as =
the
"Astavakra Gita" or something different?
