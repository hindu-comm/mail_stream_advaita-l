Dear Advaitins,

        I have changed the reply setting from both ( list and the sender)
to just List. But the List-serv will respect your reply-to setting ( if
you had that in your header). I hope it works.

        In the process of setting I have a fear that I might have changed
the mail options ( like Repro/norepro, digest etc), to default options.
If I have done that I apologize and next time I will be more careful and
please inform me, I can set it back the format you want.

Thanks.

I checked mine and they have not changed (I do not have the defaults), so=
 your
change seems to have worked fine (the reply-to now does indeed only point=
 to
the list, thanks!)


Be seeing you,
