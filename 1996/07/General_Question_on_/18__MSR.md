        The log files of Advaita list are publicly accessible. Anyone
who gets into http://tamvm1.tamu.edu/advaita/ can read the log
files. But it is possible while creating the list say that only
members of the list can access the files. But in that case you may
have to access the log files by sending listserv commands. Since our
list is open, I do not know what all complications you get into by
keeping it closed.

        I do not know whether Search-Engines have a policy to not to
include the log-files pages in their database.

 And If you are interested in being part of an e-mail discussion group
devoted to discussing Tattvavaada, feel free to send a message to
dvaita at pobox.com asking to be put on the list.  Currently, the list
                                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
unfortunately does not have a digest facility to allow postings to be
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
received in a bulk, and also does not allow users to subscribe and
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
unsubscribe directly. However, both should change over time. If either
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
consideration prevents you from joining the list, please tell us, so
that we can notify you when things improve.

I have a feeling, it is unlikely that they are maintaining log files,
as it has to be done manually again. I may be wrong. Better to ask
dvaita at pobox.com
