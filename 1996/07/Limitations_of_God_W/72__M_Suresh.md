  I did not read the remaining stuff on western philosophy in great detail as it
  would take me over an hour to do so, because I have no foundation in western
  philosophy. I understand that analytical thinking and logic play a very
  important role in it.

  Regarding your statement on mathematical truths, it does seem that they are
  equal to God atleast as far as infalliability and self-evidence are concerned.
  So it does seem that God is enclosed in a cage of logic since he is confined
 by
  logic.

  The self evidence and transcendence of mathematical truths had come up in SRH
  a long time ago. I do not remember how it ended.

  I remember you had raised a related question "Can God Change the past?" in
  SRV. I think that might be possible if past is viewed as what present says
  about the past. So if what the present has to say about the past, ( i.e the
  memory ) is changed then past would change.
