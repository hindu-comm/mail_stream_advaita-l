        One need not be God to change the past :-) There was a program
called "Time Machines" on the Discovery Channel a couple of months back
which discussed this issue at length.
        The program specifically dealt with going backwards in time.
The idea is to travel in a peculiar surface at a speed close to light
(actually the professor who demonstrated the experiment made use of a
pizza to show the structure) and you can beat light since you would have
travelled a longer distance. Actually, the program was also concerned
with paradoxes which may arise due to backward travel in time. The
professor asked "What if I take the einstein equations published now and
go back in time and publish it under my name and show it to einstein ?" etc.
Maybe this should be discussed in a different mailing list :-)
        However, if you are really interested in this, as a starter, read

        BTW, if one of you really goes back in time, please change my past :-)

Namaste.
