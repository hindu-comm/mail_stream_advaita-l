IAN: You are correct, indeed, as "true" is derived only from the relation
of true to false, it follows that false is a necessary feature of true.
If all statements were always 100% true, no statement could be defined
as a "true" statement, since "true," free from false, would have no
meaning. As such, one cannot lead away from but only to the other.

We can conclude from this that thinking leads nowhere --  I am already here.

IAN: In fact, if there are true thoughts, there must be false thoughts.
I assert that there are true vs false thoughts; thought vs nonthought.

IAN: As A is derived only from the A/not-A relation, the appearance
of duality only confirms non-duality -- i.e., unity --  hence, the more
examples of duality we have, the more examples of nonduality we have.

IAN: Right; and therefore how can we maintain the idea of separate levels
in jnana yoga? The Self is uniform and self-similar in all locations.
There is no area that is different. Levels is the illusion.


Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = (A + ~A)

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A
