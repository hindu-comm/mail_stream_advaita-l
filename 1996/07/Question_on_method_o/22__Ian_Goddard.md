IAN: Apart from stupidity or blind faith, what other methods for
acceptance of claims to truth than inability to disprove are there?

Based upon physical evidence, the dualists have not a leg to stand on.
Due to the mechanics of relational identity, not a single instance
of any separation can be identified in all of space and time.
Dualism -- where "dual" implies that A is free from ~A
-- is easily proven to be pure fallacy.


Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = (A + ~A)

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A
