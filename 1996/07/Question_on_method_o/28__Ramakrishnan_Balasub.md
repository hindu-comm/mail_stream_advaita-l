Thanks for the detailed reply. The question came about because of the
following:

shruti has the "reputation" of being un-authored. With this basic "fact"
aananda tiirtha has "proved" that the shruti is apaurusheyatva. When I pointed
out that the arguments finally meant only that shruti may have been written and
their authors' names lost or that shruti may have been un-authored, shrisha
replied that since un-authordness cannot be dis-proved beyond doubt, it must be
accepted! This doesn't make any sense to me. The situation itself has two
possibilities and neither can be disproved beyond doubt. I don't know if I am
making myself clear.

the exact quote:

--- begin
And the point really hinges upon your acceptance -- or lack thereof
-- of the notion that anything which cannot ever be concretely disproved
must be considered right.
--- end

This doesn't make sense to me. Atleast gauDapaada does not admit such notions
as far as I can see.

Also there is another difference, viz, atleast the dR^ishTi shR^ishTi vaada
school maintains that the "dreams" are no different from "waking" as far as
the respective realities in the two states goes. This is the position adopted
in the kaarikaa, yoga vaasishTa and the upadeshasaahasrii. For this one need
not have experienced brahman. However, I guess vidyaaraNya et al have a
different view in their books.
