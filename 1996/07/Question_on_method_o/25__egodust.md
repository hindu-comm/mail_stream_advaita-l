Methods of logical proof or disproof can only point us in the direction of
jnana; because jnana, although translated as 'knowledge', has nothing to do
with knowledge as we ordinarily regard it--in this case: analytical.
Rather, it has to do with cidakasa (the pure sky of awareness or pure
consciousness), registering in the heart. It's an experience that *no
particular thought or philosophy can describe* OR perhaps it can be said
to be *ALL thoughts conceivable, simultaneously!*

If whatever method we might apply--advaita, zen, sufi, etc--that doesn't
bring us to the state of pure Being, we're failing in terms of connecting our
awareness to the Self [not in terms of what we, a priori, ARE automatically,
no matter WHAT transpires in the field of Mind].  The idea that the Mind [or
the bundle of thoughts] has to be transcended is evidenced in virtually every
approach: advaitins call it 'manonasa': extinction of mind; zens call it
'mu-shin': no-mind; kabalists call it 'ain soph': void of thought; toltecs
call it 'nagual': the unknowable; the sufis have a name for it too (escapes
me).  However, the fact remains that although thoughts may yet continue, the
point is that they're no longer taken as isolated verities, *separate* from
the totality of What IS.

This should be chiseled in granite.

Namaste.
