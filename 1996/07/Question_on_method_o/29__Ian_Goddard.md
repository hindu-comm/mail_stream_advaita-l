 On 7/6/96, anand hudli observed the dualist's measure of "real":

IAN: The relational unification of anything, A, with all that it
is "external" to it, ~A, exists at all times. At * no * point in the
space-time continuum can A be shown to exist free from relation to ~A.

Therefore, due to the physical fact of the relative nature of identity,
duality -- where "duality" implies separation -- cannot be shown to
exist in any of the 3 periods, and thus duality fails to satisfy
the requirements for labeling duality as "real" as set forth
by the dualists themselves !! So much for duality!


 > Further, from  viewpoint of Brahman too, the world is real.
 > It is all Brahman! What is being denied is the
 > reality of the duality in the world.

IAN: Well stated. Every appearance of duality is the confirmation
of nonduality due to the unitary nature of relational identity in
which the nature of A is entirely a derivative of the A/~A relation
and can never exist free from this holistic unified relation.


Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = (A + ~A)

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A
