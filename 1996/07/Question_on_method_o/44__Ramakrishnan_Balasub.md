A hare's horn is not contradicted in deep sleep either. That doesn't make it
"real". There has to be a perception that something "exists" first, to question
it's "reality". We see the blue sky and later realize that it's an optical
illusion. That does not mean we cease to see the blue sky after realizing it.
Similarly from the analysis of the 3 states we can infer that there is no
qualitative difference between the perceptions, be they in the dreams or while
awake. Advaitins do not claim that everything finally "disappears" or something
like that. What cannot be questioned (without infinite regress) is the self.
Everyone knows that he exists. So the job is to find out who that is.

As far as mathematics goes it certainly has a reality in the sense that it
leads to "logical" results. Whether it exists on it's own is merely
speculation. Mathematicians like to think that theorems are discovered and not
invented.
