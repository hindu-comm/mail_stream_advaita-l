Hi,

I have a question on the method of coming to conclusions in advaita. In my
debate about the apaurusheyatva of the vedas with Shrisha Rao, he claimed that
vedantins accept "what cannot be disproved beyond doubt as the truth". Does
this method of analysis find acceptance among advaitins?

I originally mailed this question to Vidya in a personal e-mail. Later I felt
this might be a good topic for discussion here. I hope someone can answer my
question here! In my reading of gauDapaada kaarikaa I did not find such a
claim implicitly or explicitly. Clarifications most welcome.

Ramakrishnan.
