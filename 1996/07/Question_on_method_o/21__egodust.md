This method appears to be an invitation to philosophize which, as advaita
teaches us, is anathema to the jnanamarga.  Although philosophical analysis
has its place in the earlier stages of the marga, when the jiva approaches
the critical junction of ready departure from the clutches of the maya/mara-
vasanas, it's decidedly a deadly obstacle.

Namaskaar.
