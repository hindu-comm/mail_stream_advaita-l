Is not the idea (thought) expressed as: "The idea that thoughts lead away from
the Self is a dualistic fallacy," ITSELF a dualistic fallacy [because it, being
a particular thought, is leading one away from the truth]?  From this one might
infer that there are therefore true thoughts vs fallacious thoughts.  More
dualism--and more overt than the dualism that preceded it!  Technically, you're
partly correct, IMO.  Adi Sankara's triune formula addressed maya definitively:
***1. Brahman is the lone Reality;  2. The world is maya;  3. Brahman is the
world.***  And the important thing to remember in the formula is that the world
(which is the Mind or realm of thoughts) is maya only in the sense if/when we
consider it isolated and unto itself--separate from brahman.  Which leads me to
point out that I was talking about 'philosophical analysis', which implies a
*separative* belief system pertaining to the nature of reality which must be,
by Sankara's advaitic formula, illusory.

Namaste.
