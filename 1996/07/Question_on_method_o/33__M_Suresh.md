  The very fact that someone takes support of the fact that something cannot be
  disproved to stake claim for its truth means that it cannot be proved either.
  So whatever is to be passed of as truth based on the above criterion can
  neither pe proved nor disproved.

  If you cannot cannot prove or disprove a truth "X", it means that :

  1) X is false cannot be disproved.

  2) X is true cannot be disproved.

  Both  1 & 2 above satisfy the criterion "cannot be disproved beyond doubt". So
  both have to be accepted as true which is not possible. So the solution is to
  reject the criterion for the conclusion.

  However I am sure all would have come to the above conclusion after some
  reasoning. I have just stated it in one more possible way.

  As far as philosophy goes, logic, intuition and direct experience can be
 ranked
  in the increasing order. I do not know about advaita in particular.
