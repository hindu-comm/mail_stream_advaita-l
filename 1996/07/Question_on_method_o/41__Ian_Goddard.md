IAN: Right, in short: no area in physical space can be identified that
exists free from the awareness of it; therefore, awareness is a necessary
feature of physical space and things. The conclusion does not follow
perfectly, yet it cannot be disproven.

There is a one-to-one corrolation between a unit of physical reality
and the awareness of it; or, we will never measure more physical existence
than we are aware of. But this could be said to be curiosity of subjective
experience. It is not a proof that "objective" physical existence does not
exceed "subjective" awareness of it. Thus I cannot see that it disproves
the false ideation that there exits regions of space-time that are
"not-self". It is an major and not uncommon argumentations for the
universality of consciousness.

IAN: No, I intended to imply only that there is something * assumed * to
be "not-self." It is only that false assumption that is to be overthrown.

The mind by its nature is able to create the illusion of identity locality.
It is the assumption of not-self and its underling logic that is the structure
of this illusion. The false assumption is built upon Aristotelian rules of
identity which state that A is A,... A is not both A and not-A, ergo this
thing called "self" is your only in your 12 lb brain, it is not in both
your mind and all the universe that is not-your-mind. That is the fallacy.
In fact, due to relational identity, A is both A and not-A at the same time.

It follows that as the illusion is constructed by thought, it can be
dismantled by thought. In other words, every time false thought arises,
one observes its transparent nature by the logic of relational identity.

IAN: Yes, the part is nothing but a feature of the whole, apart from
which it has no existence, thus no part is part from the unified whole.
Indeed, the appearance of separation, or parts, is the proof of unity.

If all that is not-A is removed from the universal set, there could be
no thing left called "A", for A is naught but the A/not-A relation, thus
not-A is a necessary feature of A, and thus the "two" are not-two.

There is only the unified whole. As the origin of A is not-A and not-A A,
all identity in nonlocal and uniform. That is the nature of the Self.


Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = (A + ~A)

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A
