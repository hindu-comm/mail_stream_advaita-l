Namaste.

        The statement 'Anything which can not be disproved [by what ?]
should be accepted as truth' does not make sense to my mind. God itself
can not be disproved or proved through logic. A statement 'God does not
exist' can not be disproved by logic alone.

        I quotes Ramana Maharshi for describing the three theories of
creation only because the question was asked 'What are these theories ?'
I did not intend to say that those were the only theories, since there
are as many theories as there are minds.

        Panchadasi does talk extensively about duality in the chapter
'dvaita viveka'. The topics of deep sleep etc are also discussed in a
later chapter.
