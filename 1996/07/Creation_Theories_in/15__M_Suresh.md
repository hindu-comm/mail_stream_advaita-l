----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have heard the following four creation theories with reference to advaita
philosophy.

1. Ajaati Vaada ( No Creation ).

2. Drishti Srishti Vaada.

3. Srishti Drishti Vaada.

4. Krama Srishti Vaada ( Gradual creation ).

Does anyone have more information on what these theories are? Are they found
only in the schools of advaita only or also in the vedas/upanishads?

Thanks in advance for any info.

regards,
Suresh.

The prime exponent of this school is gauDapaada. This is the viewpoint of a
jiivanmukta. He does not see anything apart from the self and no changes in it.
The question ofcourse arises, what about the world we see? The point is, that
the question occurs only to the un-enlightened and not to persons like
gauDapaada. However he also teaches (2) which you mention below for the benefit
of the non-muktas.

> 2. Drishti Srishti Vaada.

Try gauDapaada kaarikaa for a full explanation. The world as it exists is
explained through the theory of maya very well. shaMkara also goes through lots
of the stock dvaitin objections and their refutations. The view point here is
that the diversity which exists (the world etc) can neither be called as
existing apart from brahman or a "part" of it. (I am planning to write up
something on this, hopefully by the end of summer.)

> 3. Srishti Drishti Vaada.

This does not require any explanation. There are various theories like how
hiraNyagarbha is formed etc and how the various elements are formed. This
theory holds that after realization, the realized people go to brahma loka or
the loka of their ishhTa devata and merge with brahman during pralaya, and are
not reborn.

This theory is usually used to teach novices and for arguments with dvaitins
(by dvaitins I mean anyone who is not an advaitin). However, if one is able to
comprehend (2), (3) is of no use.

> 4. Krama Srishti Vaada ( Gradual creation ).

Never heard of this. Sounds like (3) though.

(1) and (2) are certainly found in the vedas. Some references are given by
gauDapaada. Ex., "Indra through maya assumes diverse forms" etc. Also the
brihadaaraNyaka upanishhad contains lots of quotes supporting this. There are
other minor upanishhads explicitly using various advaitic terms. (I don't
remember the exact quotes and the sections, so I request the net-vidvans who
demand precise references to bear with me here)

(3) certainly has lots of quotations from shruti. These theories of creation are
meant for novices, according to gauDapaada.

        I think 3,4 are the same.

'Talks with Ramana Maharshi' page 421.

Maharshi:
There are three methods of approach in Advaita vada.

1. The ajaata vaada is represented by no loss, no creation, no one bound,
no saadhaka, no one desirous of liberation, no liberation. This is the
Supreme Truth. (Mandukya Karika, 2.32)
        According to this, there is only One and it admits of no discussion.

2. Drishti Srishtivada is illustrated thus : Simultaneous creation. There
are two friends sleeping side by side. One of them dreams that he goes to
Benares with his friend and returns. He tells his friend that both of them
have been in Benares. The other denies it. The statement is true from the
standpoint of one and the denial from that of the other.

3. Srishti Drishtivada is plain (Gradual creation and knowledge of it).

**

Regarding concepts [of creation etc], let me quote Ramesh Balsekar :

Concepts can at best only serve to negate one another,
as one thorn is used to remove another, and then be thrown away.
Only in deep silence do we leave concepts behind.
Words and language deal only with concepts, and cannot approach Reality.
Ceasing to conceptualize means ceasing to perceive objectively,
which means perceiving non-objectively.
It is to see the universe without choice or judgement and
without getting into subject-object relationship.
What happens then? Nothing, except that you are what you were
before you were born: everything

        Maybe this is a good subject for the advaita mailing list. Namaste.
