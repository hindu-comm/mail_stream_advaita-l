Namaste. Just letting the readers of this list know that Shiva suutras are
now available with transliteration, devangari script and translation at
ftp.uu.net in the directory tmp/sanskrit. Other shiva stotras may be
found in jaguar.
        Does any one know whether shiva sahasranama is available on
cassette/tape ? If so, who recites it ? I would also like *which* shiva
sahasranama is it.
