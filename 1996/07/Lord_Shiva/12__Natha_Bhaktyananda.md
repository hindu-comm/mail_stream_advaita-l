By the way of the announcement concerning the Shiva Sutra-s: is this
line fit for discussion of *any* form of ADVAITA (such as
ISHVARADVAYAVADA / Non-dualist Saiva of Kashmir / TRIKA), or only for
Advaita *Vedanta* ?

Obs: Sorry for the fancy Sanskrit transliteration, but I am not yet
familiar with the Internet conventions for diacritics. Maybe someone can
be of help here...

Namaskar and blessings,
