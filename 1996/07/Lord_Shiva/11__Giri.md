        Since both the sites are used frequently by the readers of this
group, I did not give the details, but it is my mistake.
        Here it is.

Anonymous ftp to ftp.uu.net and go into the directory tmp/sanskrit. You
will find the shiva suutras there and a few other sanskrit files.

Regarding jaguar, please go to
        ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/private/sanskrit/sanskrit.html
If you have some difficulty, you can try the html address
        http://www.geocities.com/RodeoDrive/1415/sanskrit.html

Namaste.
