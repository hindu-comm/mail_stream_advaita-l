Hence they resorted to saying "Neti, Neti". By denying everything
that is in the realm of relative knowledge.

The closest I can think of is one of the maha vakyas which is 
"Prajnaanam Brahma"

I am guessing that you are trying to allude to the source of the faculty
of knowing(correct me if I misunderstood you). If that is the case, as I 
see it you are postulating several sources with their respective
faculties
of knowings. :-) the way you formlated it,(I mean by its very
definition),
it cannot be known. But I fail to see if it serves any purpose, except
to
yield a nice generalization. A "multiple atman theory"(tongue in cheek)?

I would say yes. But I cannot say if that is the end of duality.
Because,
I am still in the realm of reason/knowledge/logic. After understanding
this
if the mind comes to a complete halt then probably(again speculation on
my
part).

Before I go ahead and say that we all are that, I wouldfirst stop to 
consider if there is any other. And as far as knowing goes, all I am
aware
of is my knowledge in terms of objects and concepts. Any other
speculation
(as regards its source, its unknowability, its transcendence, its
non-uniqueness/uniqueness) will only build my knowledge in terms of 
concepts. That is the reason why great teachers advocated stilling the 
mind first. And I do feel that it has to be so. I really don't know what 
constitutes Sruti. So I cannot comment.

regards,
Srinivas Sista.

P.S: 
I was just kidding about Bankei. There have been cases where the person
was enlightened long before they actually found out from others &
scriptures
that their state is what is refered to as enlightened.
