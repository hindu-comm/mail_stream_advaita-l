Dear Jonathan,

     Thank you so much for a most enlightening post.

      Like actors on the stage, it only appears that "free will" determines
our actions and movements.   Yet, it is only a cosmic script.

     We need only to choose..... what we have already chosen!

     (But, do we really have a choice in choosing even THAT?!")  Stay tuned!


                                           With Blessings,


                                           Chuck Hillig
