I believe perfect peace is possible.  It's perfect behavior that does not
seem realizable.

Why should Happiness disturb Perfect Peace in any way? You attain
ultimate peace only when you attain Brahman, and the own nature of
Brahman is absolute happiness (aanandaM brahma). MaNDanamishra discusses
the problem of happiness in his BrahmakaaNDa (the first partt of
Brahmasiddhi). (Paul S.)
