My view on this is the following:

Yes, you are *really* asking me this question and I am *really* responding
to it. But, what does *really* mean here ? Let me elaborate.

It is a question and an answer in a theatre drama. We are acting our roles
with the script given to us. We are real in the drama. We are not real in
the absolute sense. How well do we act our role ? In modern theatre, the
best an actor/actress acts is when he/she identifies with the role and
gets the audience think that the person acting and the role being acted
are the same. The actor/actress gets ovation for the performance. In the
world drama, which we are discussing, the reverse is true. The wise person
always sees that as a role and keeps the role and the inner self separate.
That may not be best acting in the present-day acting standards, but is
the hallmark of a wise person.

In a straight answer to your question, yes, they are all illusory. The
only reality is the one that never changes. Gaudapaada says in Mandukya
kaarikaa:

Adau ante ca yaan naasti, vartamaanepi tat tathaa

What did not exist at the beginning and what is not going to exist at the
end is as good as non-existent even in the present.
