A great Zen master (Bankei) doubted his own enlightenment for years because
he could not find anyone enlightened enough to verify it. He toured Japan
for decades saying that he wanted to spare anyone else a similar discomfort.
The record of his teaching is delightful and highly recommended. It has
the ring of truth for sure... (IMO)    (and does not contradict anything
important in Advaita Vedanta either... :-)

best to all,

Allan Curry
