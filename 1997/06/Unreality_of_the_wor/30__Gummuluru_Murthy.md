I read about Shri Shankara giving a special status to the world between
the illusory nature of the thoughts and the absolute reality of the
Brahman. My feeling is: either it is real or it is false. There cannot
be a half-way status. Shri Shankara, being one who formulated advaita
in a classic fashion at the historical time he did, must have his reasons
for giving a half-way status to the world (if he did). I would second
Allan's request for elaboration on this topic.

When all the desires that dwell in the heart fall away, then the mortal
becomes immortal, and attains Brahman even here.
