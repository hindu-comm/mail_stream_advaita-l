Historically, advaita as a system of vedaanta explicitly starts by
interpreting Sruti (yes that is scripture). There has not been any great
motivation for the teachers of advaita to establish its truth independent
of Sruti.

Besides, normally what happens is that even if one particular teacher does
not refer his teaching to a pre-existent scripture, over a few centuries,
his teachings take on the role of scripture for the followers. This is
what has happened in the case of Buddhism, no?

Once (and only once) Sankara also refers to a personal experience which no
one can doubt.
