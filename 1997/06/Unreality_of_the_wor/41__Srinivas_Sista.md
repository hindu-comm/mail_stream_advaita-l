I apologize to the list members for the way in which I present my
non-advaita kind of arguments. I am not knowledgeable enough to quote
any of the great teachers of advaita. I am trying to throw in my
impressions which seem pretty intuitive to me(no doubt based on what
I have seen and read).

Who decides? And I wonder what kind of "proof" you are expecting.
Either you believe yourself(perception,inference) or somebody else
(including books,people,shruti,..etc) or a combination of both. There
is no proof beyond these. The point here is, as long as you choose to
believe, it doesn't matter which one it is. You are still in the realm
of beliefs :-)

I am sorry if I gave you the impression that I am judging the veracity
of your experiences. I am sure you would've noticed the "IF" I put in
front of my statement. I cannot say whether you had a headache or not,
leave alone non-dual awareness. I take it that you had the experiences
you reported that you had. I am merely trying to make a few observations
based on what you said.

>This "state" is no more created by thought than a punch in the nose is.

See that is the problem I have with your statements. How come a punch in
the nose is NOT created by thought? If I may draw an analogy to the
computer, you seem to equate the hardware representation(when none of
the software is running) to the non-dual awareness(please excuse me if
this is not the case, I am merely verbalizing my impressions about your
statements).  But the hardware representation is a function of the
hardware! Have you heard of the phenomenon called "phantom limb" which is
pretty popular in medical parlance? Soldiers who got their limbs amputated
in the hospitals still feel that they have those limbs. They do feel
itching/pain etc of the amputated limb(long after amputation) and try to
scratch/soothe etc while they are wide awake.

As I said, you are free to postulate the "other" when you are not *being*
non-dual awareness. It is upto you again to "believe" or not whether the
whole thing is cooked up by the meat of the brain. Again, I wonder what
you mean by "proof". If you are looking for additional beliefs, I have
nothing to offer.

>I am intrigued by what you refer to as "recognizing the futility of
>pursuing experiences".  Can you please elaborate on that further?

Sure. Experiences are used to construct beliefs(logic,reason,theories).
Beliefs are used to explain experiences. Looking for a proof, however
exalted it may sound is just a pursuit of an experience. Which is why
I was refering to it as futile(by saying futile I do not imply the
existence of some worthwhile activity).

:-) looking for somebody to certify his enlightenment? As though that
is not sufficient he did not find anyone "enlightened enough" to verify
his own. This is some kind of a joke. I really enjoy this. Did he
succeed in establishing a certification procedure to spare others
a similar discomfort?

Srinivas Sista.

Hi

I have some doubts. If u can, please clear them.

What's the difference between Jeevan Muktha and rest of the persons.

Does Jeevan Muktha experience Sorrow.

If a Jeevan Muktha experienced a physical pain in his body , how come he
identify himself with Brahman. (That is, while experiencing physical
pain he identify himself with his physical body.)

What's the difference between Jeevan Muktha and Vidhega Muktha.

With Regards
Madhavan
