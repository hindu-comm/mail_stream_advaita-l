It seems most religions base themselves on some kind of scripture which
gives valid epistemological status to "things that are not perceived
or inferred" in any other way. Most religions feel quite certain that their
scripture is correct and the other fellow's scripture is "make believe".
I had hoped Advaita Vedanta could establish its truth independently of
Sruti (if that means scripture) and perhaps it can although it seems
a little doubtful to me at this point.

I am reminded of Nietzsche's comment, "fine feelings are not arguments".
I myself have experienced non-dual awareness in waking and sleep states
countless times over a period of several years and it is not clear to me
why this "state" should be interpreted to be more ontologically basic than
any other. It does seem profoundly peaceful, joyously complete, and
perfectly simple, but so what? Why should I assume it is the ontological
foundation of the universe rather than a very enjoyable mode of brain
function?  It may be either I suppose or even some other possibility.

When Sankara was asked how he knew he was Brahman he replied,
"because my guru said I was". How lucky he was to have recourse to such
a simple ending of doubt!

best to all,

Allan Curry
