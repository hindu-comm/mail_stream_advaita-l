May I point out here that advaita is not a religion, but a
philosophy. People have adopted advaita not because it is a
religion, but because it gives sound explanation for the human
perceptions. It is true that upanishhads are the base on which
advaita was developed. The upanishhads are the wise statements
put forward by people who experienced sat-chit-ananda, the
eternal bliss. While upanishhadic statements have been
interpreted in other ways, advaita still gives the sound basis
for understanding the upanishhads. We are in search of
understanding the root cause of birth, death, misery, pleasures,
affection, hatred etc; why do we go through this and is there
anything beyond that ? Advaita says that we go through these
opposites because of our ignorance. Recognize what is real and
what is unreal and seek what is real. One need not seek; It comes
to you.

We recognize the limitations of human. To explain happenings
beyond human ability and logic, we invoke God. But, is there
really God and creation ? Advaita philosophyy goes beyond God and
to universal non-duality and permanence. The concept of God is
required to practice humility, humbleness and for the melting of
the ego, which are fundamental pre-requisites for understanding
advaita. Once a person is ripe for understanding advaita, there
is no turning back. Advaita stands on its own independent of
Sruti. However, upanishhads being wise statements of experience
(I am sure no one can deny the wisdom of the upanishhads),
advaita has to be tested against the statements of the
upanishhads. Advaita being theory, upanishhads being statements
of experience, in case of conflict, naturally, the statement of
experience will take precedence over theory.

Obviously the joy that was experienced by the brain at one moment
was replaced by the misery of the world the next moment. In my
view, what was experienced was not the ontological foundation of
the universe but simply a brain-function. If it were what you
call the ontological foundation of the universe (I will use sat-
chit-ananda for it), it would be permanent and not a function of
time.

I do not know this historical statement. I would be grateful for
reference to this statement.
