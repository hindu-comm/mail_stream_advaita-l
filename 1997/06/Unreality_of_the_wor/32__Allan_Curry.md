Very good, I have no argument with any of the above. I agree with it
except possibly for the notion of the senses "going out" to objects.
I'd say the objects come to the senses by means of assorted mechanical
forces, but this may be just a different way of phrasing the same thing.

What is important is there actually is some kind of world "out there"
and you say Advaita acknowledges it in some way shape or form as being
necessary to explain the way things are.

The world as it appears to us is obviously not independent of Atman if
Atman is what we want to call awareness. To assume that the world is also
something "in-itself" (to use Kant's terminology) apart from our
awareness/perception of it seems to be a reasonable belief given the above
discussion of the Advaitin theory of perception. We can perhaps experience
ourselves as being boundless awareness, but how can we know that the
world-in-itself (independent of our body/mind's interaction with it) is
identical to our self (ie. boundless awareness)? Neither our selves nor the
things of the outside world (as they are in-themselves) can be known by us
as objects.  All indiscernibles may seem like one to us and yet not be in
themselves. How could we know whether these two indiscernibles are one or
two when neither can be discerned as an object?

all the best,
