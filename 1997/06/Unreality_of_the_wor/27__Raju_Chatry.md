Hi,
If this will give you some response you are looking for;
>From Geeta, The unreal has no existence, and the real never ceases to be; the
reality of both has thus been perceived by the seers of truth.  2/16
Not to understand its reality but to perceive somethingelse means is
illusory, for example to see ornaments which is made of all gold. when you
see only ornaments you are not seeing it is all gold. But when you see in all
that shape it is all Gold , only gold  although it is in different shapes of
ornaments. Then it is not illusion. Just like seeing the Snake  in rope. rope
has never become snake, rope is rope but since the vision is not clear sees
the rope & getting scared. Pranam .
Jaya Sri Ram . raju
