This is true.  In Gujarat Navaratri is the most important utsava of the
year and the Chandi Path (another name for the Saptashati) is listened to
attentively by everyone even if they are not Shaktas.  But as rewarding as
listening to the plain meaning is, there is much more punya for those who
understand the secret meaning.

The 700 mantras of Chandi Path are part of Markandeya Purana which is a
completely seperate work from Brahmand Purana.  Some of the auxillary
stotras (i.e. kavach, argal, and kilak) are parts of Brahmand Purana
though.  So is Lalita Sahasranam which is another very important stotra.

It is interesting to note however although the texts are Vedic, the
various vidhis associated with the path are Tantric.  Our tradition is
that they are according to Katyayini Tantra.  The great Shri Bhaskar Raya
also wrote his tika called Guptavati (expressing the hidden knowledge
contained within the mantras) according to this Tantra. Katyayini
Tantra belongs to the Shuddha or Dakshina Marg so it is fully in step with
Vedic teachings.
