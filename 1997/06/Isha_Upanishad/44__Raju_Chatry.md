Hello
I do not have Isha Upnisad & I do not recall about what does that mean but If
I recall Bhagbat Geeta, Is it like Karma Yoga & jyana Yoga ?What ever work we
do is Karma Yoga, worshis of all pervaded God by our action & to understand
our true identity, It is already Immortal any way. We just have to realise it
. Hope it is not to far from what it meant. Namaste. Raju
