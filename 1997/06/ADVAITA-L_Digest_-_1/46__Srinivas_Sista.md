Could you please elaborate on "extra-mental source of data"?
Did such a dream ever occur to you where you see things that you
haven't encountered before and people say things that could arouse
emotions much akin to waking state(like anxiety, anger, joy etc)?
Didn't you dream of any events where questions & answers are
involved? (Erwin Schroedinger refers to a similar example).
Did you ever wake up more than once inside dreams(like you wake up
from a dream think that it is waking state and after sometime you
again wake up ... so on)? Isn't it just a postulate when you say
that there exists something which gives rise to the world and feelings?
This is like postulating gravity to explain "falling" objects. You
seem to give an independent existence to events(in whatever form)
and that mind just represents it as we are aware of them.
