"So whatever anyone else may do or say, whatever happens, leave things as
they are. Don't worry yourself over them and don't side with yourself. Just
stay as you are, right in the Buddha-mind, and don't change it into
anything else. If you do that, illusions don't occur and you live
constantly in the unborn mind. You're a living, breathing firmly
established Buddha".
