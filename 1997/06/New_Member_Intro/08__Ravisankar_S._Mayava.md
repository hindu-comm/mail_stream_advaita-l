A brief intro of myself:

Dev Thakur
High School Sophomore (Hatboro Horsham High School in Pennsylvania)
Devout Hindu, interested in Advaita and Vedanta (Regularly attend a nearby
Chinmaya Mission, and listen to lectures on Gita given by Swami
Shantanandaji, disciple of Swami Chinmayanandaji)
Also into Bhajans and Hindustani Classical Music (I play Harmonium and
Tabla)
Aspire to become a physician, interested very much into science, math, etc.
Also into Computers and Programming (Pascal, c/c++, visual c++, java,
visual basic, etc)
I wish to incorporate Advaita into my daily life, and increase my level of
happiness.
Hari Om!
Dhanyavadah!
