                                       SRIMATRENAMAH

NAMASTE!

I am planning to perform the 12th of 18 chandi homam in Ujjaini in Mahakali
sannidhyam in Kartika masam (November 13) and Rudra Homam on 14th Kartika
Poornima, Ganapati Homam on 12th.  The reason I am posting is to rquest
information from members if they know some one in Ujjaini who can be our POC.
 Its always advantageous to know some local person when we dont know  the
local language and available facilities.  Somehow I am lucky in finding a
local POC at all the other 11 locations scattered all over India.  I have the
confidence that I will find someone but I have to do my effort (manava
prayatnam).

Blessings                                                     Nageswar
