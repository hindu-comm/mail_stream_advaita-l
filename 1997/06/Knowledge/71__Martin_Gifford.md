Hi ALL !

I'm new to the list so I hope I'm not going over old ground.

It seems to me that "knowledge" is a pretense and fantasy. That which is
known as a separate fact is actually a creation. We create a separation (or
division) and then say that that creation and it's ensuing implications are
facts.

A "useful way of looking at things" is the most we can claim or aim for.

Best wishes to ALL,

Martin Gifford.
