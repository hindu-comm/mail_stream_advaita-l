If you are still thinking of non-dual awareness as a "state" then
I have to say that whatever you have experienced was only a delusion
of non-dual awareness(sorry, no offence meant). Your confusion as to
whether you should regard it as more basic than other states just
means that you had some experiences(based on what you read or deduced)
which are no different from the other thought created realities. But
it is good that you are questioning the validity of experiences, be
they sublime or the trivial. That is surely a way to recognize the
futility of pursuing experiences.

Srinivas Sista.
