I am afraid that Shri Nageswar Rao's logic in the above statement is
not quite right, in my view.

"Spiritual pursuit" is not while sitting at the meditation seat only.
It is a process where we lead a life of dharma all 24 hours a day.
While doing work, or while commuting, or while "relaxing", spiritual
life need not be abandoned. Doing an honest day's work (without having
particular affection to the result, but performing work; kurvanneveha
karmaani Isha upanishhad, verse 2) and thinking about paramatma while
commuting (meditate on Shri Lalitha trisathi, or Vishnu sahasranaama)
are part of the spiritual life. Find relaxation studying and contem-
plating on upanishhadic statements. If we set only an hour aside for
"spiritual pursuit" and doing other things for 23 hours, we are not
following a spiritual life.

I also feel "spiritual pursuit" is a wrong representation. Pursuit is
chasing an elusive object. If our mind accepts a life of dharma, and if
our buddhi is pure, there is nothing to pursue. Spiritual life is within
us. We become the most relaxed spiritual persons and we will have all the
time at our disposal. There is nothing time-bound.

I am of the considered view that our responsibilities as a family person
in no way impede our leading a life of spirituality and righteousness.
One can lead a life of mental renunciation right in the middle of a city
with all the so-called family responsibilities.
