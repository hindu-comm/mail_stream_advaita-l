Firstly, so that the List members are in full knowledge, Shri Nageswar
Rao and I know each other for a long time. Shri Nageswar Rao is my wife's
elder brother.

What I am saying is: one need not make a conscious effort to lead a
spiritual life. It comes naturally if our buddhi is pure. Thus, we
become the embodiment of dharma. No pursuits are involved.

Shri Nageswar Rao mentions about incident in 1960's when he went through
red lights listening to Gita. The situation is in no way worse (in terms
of distraction to driving) than people talking on phone while driving,
a very common sight now-a-days. Chanting Shri Lalitha trisathi or Vishnu
sahasranaama while driving or commuting on train gives us humility, an
essential requirement in our understanding ourselves. I am not saying
this is a substitute for concentrated meditation and sandhya-vandanam,
but a very useful usage of the commuting time.
