Well, spot on! That's surrender.

BUT....

It depends what we are to accept. We can't accept actions that arise out of
dualistic ideas. Actions that arise out of the feeling of separation cause
further ignorance and suffering in ourselves and others.

Do you include violence, etc. as the "unspiritual aspects of ourselves" that
we should accept?

Many people think that we should accept war, violence, etc. as part of life.
But they come from ego which is the lack of acceptance, which is the sense
of separation.

To me the "unspiritual aspects or ourselves" are anything that comes from
the idea of separation.

Martin Gifford.
