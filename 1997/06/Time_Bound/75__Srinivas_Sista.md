I wonder if there is any other kind of "activity". All activities by
their very nature are time bound. I dont quite understand what you
mean by futile.

One doesn't need to use an alarm clock and be thinking of that!
How about "roughly an hour". Which can be infered after one gets
out of meditation. Again it doesn't really matter how much time
one spends in meditation as long as one sincerely applies oneself
to meditation. The duration is absolutely of no concern, although
in the beginning it will be very difficult to sit even for a very
short time.

I again wonder if there are any responsibilities that are not self
imposed. Even if it is considered that others in the name of the
society are imposing, it is just a way of sustaining self imposed
responsibility. Nobody can make us do what we do not wish to do. It
is just that we change our wishes with changing circumstances,
justifying all such changes with clever reasoning(others,responsibilty,
ethics, ...etc)

Again, I would like a clarification on time bound activities. Because
I can't see any other kind of activity(by activity I mean anything
that we do with our mind & body).
