Yes, for what it's worth I agree. We create each other. I'd rather be
created by nature and/or a realised person than by the manager or accountant!

Things in the physical plane happen slowly. The brain cells have been
conditioned for 15 years at least to cope with this mad world. To remove
this accumulated ignorance we need all the help we can get.

Best wishes to ALL,

Martin Gifford.
