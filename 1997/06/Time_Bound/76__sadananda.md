Nagy -
Here is my understanding:
 First, any pursuit including spiritual pursuit (or sadhana) itself
involves an action, physical or mental or both,  and this includes
meditation.  All actions are time bound from physics point.  Realization is
knowledge and it is not time-bound since it ever exists.  I am that I am -
existence and consciousness and happiness that I am is eternal.  Since I
have mistaken notions about my self as that I am limited, ignorant and
unhappy, I need to re-educate my self about my self in order for me to drop
these notions about my self. Even when I am told with all the logic, I am
the subject and not an object, I take myself to be this body, mind and
intellect which are objects.  The block is caused by the impurity which
blocks my true vision about myself. These impurities called vasanas which
were accumulated by the ego-centric actions can only be removed by the
ego-centric actions - or Sadhana or spiritual pursuits
Hence to answer your question, spiritual pursuits which are time bound are
needed to purify the mind so that it will drop all the notions when it is
told that - tat tvam asi or aham Brahmaasmi etc.

You are right,  from realization point it is immediate and now and
therefore not-time bound - Recognize even time is a concept of the mind or
thought.  I am consciousness of even the time.  That means even the time is
in my consciousness like the thought is, the world is etc.

That is the glory of the advaita teaching.  Moksha is not the result of
going any where (Vaikunta or Kailaasa), doing any thing which can be gained
only after death of this physical body.  If Moksha is worth the effort, we
want it now and here not sometime in future which involves time!

>From the point of now and here, time does not exist, since to define time
you need two sequential events (can be two thoughts) with a single observer
to recognize the events.  The observer who is a conscious entity is beyond
the events or beyond the time.

>From my true nature, any pursuit is meaningless including meditation.
Dattatreya says in Avadhuta Geeta:
"aham dhyaata param dhyeyam akhandam khandate katham?"
"I am the  meditater and this is to be meditated upon - how can you divide
that which is indivisible? "

Hari Om!
