Namaste!

There is an interesting dialogue which took place between H.H. Sri Swami
Krishnanandaji Maharaj and Andrew Cohen on the subject of time which
appeared in the Fall '95 issue of "What Is Enlightenment?" The dialogue
titled "Dare to give up the Illusion of Time" is online at

Hari Om!

Pannir
