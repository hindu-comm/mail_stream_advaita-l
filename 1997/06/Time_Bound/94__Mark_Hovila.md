Yes, of course we should accept that war occurs, or that there is violence
within ourselves.  The alternative to acceptance is denial, or
self-deception.  Do I mean that we should approve of war, violence, etc?
Certainly not.  But again, if we find ourselves approving of it, we should
accept the fact that we approve of it.  The word "accept" often gives
people trouble, as it has multiple meanings.  I simply mean we should face
the facts, unpleasant as they may seem.  Our egos are very selective in
what they accept.  They may choose to accept only the good things about
ourselves, or some may choose to accept only the bad things.  If we truly
are able to face What Is, without judgment or interpretation, the ego has
no more role.
