Thank you Pannir I just read the article you suggested.  It is very
interesting and informative.  Suggest everybody read it.

My belief that Time-Bound Acts in Spirituality are futile is reinforced.  Its
Here and Now like my friend Sada said.   How? every one has their own
approach.

Dear Nageswar,

To expand on my earlier post, when I say meditation is facing the facts, to
me that is the same as saying meditation is facing (or accepting) God.  God
is All That Is.  In our usual state, we try to actively avoid facing All
That Is by engaging in activities designed to prop up the falsehood of a
personal self, or ego.  One of the things the ego does is tell us that the
world (including aspects of ourselves that we dislike) is "unspiritual" and
that we must retreat within to find God.  But this is merely an escape, an
avoidance of God, a denial of God's omnipresence.  It is an attempt to hold
onto the fictitious personal self by creating a so-called better, more
"spiritual" personal self.  Facing the facts means to accept, without
interpretation or judgment, all that we see, hear, smell, taste and feel,
as well as the reactions of our body-mind.  In complete acceptance there is
no person, there is only Freedom.

Mark
