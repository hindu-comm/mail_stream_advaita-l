And when the ego has no more role, will that be the end of violent actions
from that person?

There are of course many levels of violence (how many microorganisms do we
kill daily?) but intentional, aggressive violence, it seems to me, belongs
to the ego, to duality.  If there is no duality, no self/other split, it
would be like being violent toward oneself.

When my ego disappears I will give you a more definite answer. :)
