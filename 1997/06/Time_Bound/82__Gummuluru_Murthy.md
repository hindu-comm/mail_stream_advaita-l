What was mentioned above by Shri Ravi has lot of merit and was beautifully
put.

Who is ripe for abiding in the Self ? My answer to that would be: the
person who has seen all the various facets of this world: the maaya-
kalpita deshakaalakalanaavaichitryachitr^ikr^tam; a person who has
lived as a brahmachaari, as a grihastha, lived in India, lived outside
India, lived as a sannyasi in an ashrama, seen all facets of the life
and has come to recognition that there is something beyond the worldly
pleasures and miseries. Such a person is ripe for Realization. Such a
person has seen all that the world can offer and has rejected all after
personal experience. The fire which Shri Ravi alluded above will be
strong in such a person.

If a person has not experiened it, there may be a lingering doubt
somewhere, creating vasanaas. By shielding a brahmachaari-aspirant from
not mixing with householders, yes, there is an attempt to get the fire
(of seeking Self-Realization) going. But how long can such a feeble fire
be maintained ? Such shielding creates vasanaas in the
brahmachaari-aspirant which only the brahmachaari-aspirant can get over.

There are many paths to seeking to recognize what we are and attain
Brahman. Each person is assigned an individual route. However much we
discuss which route is superior, the route we follow is assigned and we
are on it; we cannot set up any deviations. What I mean by this is: we
cannot think it is we who can change the route. Even the deviation which
we may take is part of the assigned route.
