It is my view that driving and meditation certainly can take place
simultaneously.  For that matter, any activity in life can be meditation.
If one "loses consciousness" and runs red lights, etc., one is not
meditating, one is in some kind of trance.  Meditation is facing the facts,
seeing things as they are in the Here and Now, not losing oneself in some
beautiful thought or emotion.
