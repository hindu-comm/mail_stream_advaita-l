        I too would like to add to the cauldron on the question of the
realisation of enlightment!

        Isn't, even, the Shruti but a guide to help in Self-Realization? So if
one has truly attained enlightment, isn't he above the Shruti, to refer to it to
confirm his enlightment? And if one's not able to realize that he's really
enlightened, is he truly enlightened? And does it r
really matter if he's to realize that he's realized?
