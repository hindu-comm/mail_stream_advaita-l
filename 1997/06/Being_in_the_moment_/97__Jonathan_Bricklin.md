Yes, except I think it would be wrong to confuse being in the moment with
being "heads-up."  Attention to what is, does not entail attention to
everything in your immediate environment.  I actually don't think we ever
lose consciousness.  Even a black-out is only a black-in of which only the
last moment was remembered.  Moreover,  I think its perfectly possible to
be completely centered in the exact arising moment, feel/express the total
love that comes with the dissolution of self in such a state, and be very
deluded about the implications of it all.    In other words, I believe that
meditation always stresses process over content.
