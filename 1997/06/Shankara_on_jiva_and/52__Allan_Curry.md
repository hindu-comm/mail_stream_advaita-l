        I'll agree with that.

I didn't say that Nietzsche was a nice person, or an authority on anything.
I agree with him that "fine feelings are not arguments", that's all.
Actually, he wasn't talking about religion in general, he said it was the
Jewish/Christian religion in particular that does what you describe above.
I don't recall him talking about Vedanta, if much was even known about it
in Europe during the time he lived.

Non-dual awareness has occured (or seemed to) many times. When it occurs
there seems to be nothing to doubt and no one to doubt it. As I said in
another post, the view from being non-dual awareness reveals no other of
any kind, but that does not prove that there is no other. It may just seem
that way.

I never feel seperate from the universe but as the magnetic field is one
thing and the steel another, the fact of their non-seperateness does not
establish their identity. Does it?

best to all,

Allan Curry

P.S.

Cameron asks:

>My question to you would be: who is it who experienced this "state"?

There seems to be only awareness in that state, there seems to be no one
having that awareness and no object of that awareness. Why do you ask?
