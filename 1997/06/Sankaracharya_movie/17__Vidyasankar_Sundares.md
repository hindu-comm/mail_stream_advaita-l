You can get copies directly from the National Film Development Corporation
of India (NFDC), I suppose. Call S. Narayanan at the NFDC Bombay office at
91-22-497 3364, or send email to snaryan at nfdcnet.co.in. The film by G. V.
Iyer is listed at the NFDC website
(http://www.nfdcindia.com/mipcom1.html).
