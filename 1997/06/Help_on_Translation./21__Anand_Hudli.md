  There is case of mistaken identity at work here! I mistook
  upadheya for upadheya or upaadheya  without realizing that
  it could be upaadeya. This latter word, upaadeya means
  roughly the same as upeya, something that is to be
  obtained, acquired.
  So heyopaadeya (heya+upaadeya) means the same as heyopeya.

  I recognized heyopaadeya while listening to the lalitaa
  sahasra-naama. One of the names of lalitaa mentioned in
  this famous hymn from the BrahmaaNDa puraaNa is
  heyopaadeyavarjitaa, She who has nothing to abandon and
  nothing to acquire.
