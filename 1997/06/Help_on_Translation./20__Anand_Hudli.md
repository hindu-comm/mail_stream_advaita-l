      upaaya is the means or remedy to something.
      upeya is something that is to be approached or something that
      is to be obtained.

      heya is something that is to be abandoned or left out.
      upadheya does not ring a bell for me. Maybe a more
      appropriate word may be heyopeya, meaning something
      that is to be abandoned or something that is to be
      obtained. One may talk about, for example,
      heyopeyavilakshhaNa, something that is neither to be
      abandoned nor to be obtained.

>Thanks.
