Hi!

My name is Prashant Risbud. I am computer professional working at Advance
Bank in Sydney, Australia. My interest in advaita (and Indian
philosophy/religion, in general) has been kindled by reading literature
from Ramakrishna Ashram, Ramanashrama. I would like to join this group
with an intention to read the mails (rather than contributing). I hope
this much of introduction will suffice.

Regards,
Prashant
