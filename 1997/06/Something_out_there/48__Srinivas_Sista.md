One can assume whatever one pleases and argue its degree of
reasonableness based on another set of assumed logical principles.
The counter examples I gave(regarding dreams) are intended to show
that the mind does not need any kind of external(if such a thing
exists) environment to create, sustain and destroy realities.
Note: I am not saying that you should assume that there is nothing
      outside the mental representation. That would be as much a
      postulate as the assumption that there is something "out there".
