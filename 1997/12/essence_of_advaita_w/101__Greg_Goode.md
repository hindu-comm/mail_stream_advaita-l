I'll have to look at home for this....  Now I'll take a stab at (2):

Depends on the person's background, what ideas they're used to.  For a
Westerner coming to Advaita sometime in the last decade, I think the second
proposition is easier to understand:  "Jeevo brahmaiva nah parah."  Reason
being, many Westerners are used to thinking from the New Age, in terms of
concepts/phrases such as these:

   God is within you.

   Your inner essence is divine.

   You are divine.

   You are one with God

But to see that "Brahmah satyam jagan mithya" -- Brahman is the only
reality, all else being unreal -- this is harder to grasp initially.  This
was the case for me.  Interestingly enough, I think on this list, we have
more discussions related to "Jeevo brahmaiva nah parah," than to "Brahmah
satyam jagan mithya."
