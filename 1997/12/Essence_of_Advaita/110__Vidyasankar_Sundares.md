Dear Miguel Angel,

You ask extremely pertinent questions.

The missing link is the personal experience of aham brahmAsmi. Or else,
the missing link is the belief in the word of the Veda (Sruti). For many
who have no personal experience of that, the testimony of the Sruti is a
source of knowledge that is beyond all doubt.

Part of the problem lies in the way questions are asked. Really, there are
no things "other" than the absolute. If "I" am that absolute, there is no
further need to talk of any relation, is there?

You must read Sankara's introudction to his BrahmasUtra-bhAshya to clarify
this. We imagine ourselves to be many things that we really are not. And
we have partial knowledge of things. The most common assumption is that
the Self is the embodied and acting subject, part of a real world, that is
experienced many times by many jivas .... This is alternative (d).

The Self can only be satisfactorily described as "neti, neti" which is why
all the alternatives you offer sound very unsatisfactory. To say that the
world is mithya goes hand in hand with saying that the jIva is brahman.
And once you know that the jIva is brahman, all questions cease, there
will be no more doubt about any thing.

All talk of enlightenment is only from the perspective of the
unenlightened. One who thinks he is unenlightened, is unenlightened. It is
this thought that gives rise to all this activity.

Remember what Alexander did to the Gordian knot? He didn't waste effort
trying to untie it. He took a sword to it and cut asunder the ropes that
made up the knot. You must do a similar thing with these questions.

With best wishes,
Vidyasankar
