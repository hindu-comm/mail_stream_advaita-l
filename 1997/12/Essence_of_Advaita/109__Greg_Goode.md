Why?  Lila!  Don't look for anything more profound.  If you feel you must
find the answers to these kinds of questions, perhaps you can find a living
teacher.  You know, as Nanda Kumar (I believe it was he) asked on this list
a while ago:

     Guru Wanted.

This is why many Vedanta teachers don't expose their students to the
highest non-dualist teachings till the necessary mental, emotional,
educational distillation has taken place (via karma and bhakti yogas) --
advaita can be really hard to understand!

Have you read the Yogavashista or the Mandukya Upanishad or the Ashtavakra
Samhita?

Miguel,

Dan's reply (below) to your question reminds me:  He himself has written a
book that deals with the same subject: living in the here and now, free of
memory, free of anticipation, free of concepts, free of ego.  Some teachers
consider this state, if it persists, to be enlightenment itself.

So, if the list will excuse me (it's not orthodox advaita vedanta), I will
plug Dan's book:

     _The_Sacred_Portable_Now_, (forgot the publisher), c1997.

It's a good book, and will allow you to keep from being obsessed by
thoughts, questions and answers.
