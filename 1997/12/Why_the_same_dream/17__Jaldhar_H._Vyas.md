Yes that's true.  But Lalita Mata could just as easily claim that we are
figments in Her mind only. :-)  I don't think we can say we say the world

hovewer responsible for its removal.

Can somebody give me some background information on Hitopadesha? And I would
also like a reference to a good translation.
