Don't really agree, see below...

Don't know if I agree here, because I don't really agree that there really
are millions of psychosomatic forms.  I don't think there are any forms at
all, because ultimately I think the non-creation theory is the most sound
and the most appealing.

There are various theories of creation.  The one you are alluding to above
in paragraph (1) is called in Vedanta the Vivartavada theory, where the
effect is the APPARENT manifestation of its cause (as opposed to the
Satkaryavada theory, in which the effect pre-exists in seed form within the
cause, or the ajati-vada theory, in which there is no creation at all).  So
we won't be able to agree on (2).  But for argument's sake, I'll assume
both (1) and (2) along with the Vivartavada theory of creation.

NOTHING can affect or even appear to affect the One Consciousness.  How
could it?  But, the stuff you're saying below does happen.

They aren't mistakes, they are part of how (in the Vivartavada theory)
Brahman apparently manifests as the effects.  Not the fault of any jiva.
But in this theory, there IS identification with various things in
phenomenality.  OK, I'm with you so far.

What it is that experiences the world is not the Self exactly.  Maybe you
can say that what experiences everything is Lower Brahman or Hiranyagarbha
(sum total of all subtle bodies), the Total Self of the Katha Upanishad.
But it would be overly anthropomorphic to say that Nisargadatta's
"Awareness" experiences anything.  It is the substratum of all experiences,
not an experiencer.  But the Total Self or the Cosmic Mind
(Hiranyagarbha)is the sum total of all experiencers, so nothing is beyond
it.  So it's not surprising that Hitler and Gandhi are different experiencers.

Part of the Lila!   That's the beauty of the whole thing!!!

Some are drawn to A-type explanations, some are drawn to B-type
explanations.  Traditionally, teachers have reserved A-type explanations
for the more mature students.  Why?  Look what happens in the hand of a
neophyte:  "Why did I cheat on my wife?  There is no responsibility, for
there is no ego, all is illusion.  It is all just happening, part of the
One Consciousness."  Now you know, that is insincere at best of this
person.  This person needs the strenuous training needed to perfect the
disciple, qualifications mentioned in Tattva Bodha and other places.
