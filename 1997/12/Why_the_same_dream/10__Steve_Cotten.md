Reasoning what? And "standing under" what? "Being" is the method and the
goal. My main "tool" is calming the mind until I am able to spend "time out
of mind" which is my favorite place to "be".

It was mentioned earlier the difference between Advaita and Buddhism were
that one led to enlightenment and the other happiness. In my experience they
are one in the same. I am Happiness. It is "imaginary thoughts" that "seem"
to block that from my awareness.

I love this group.

Aloha from Hawaii,
Steve
