The Garbha Gita gives the lament of the unborn child who anticipates being
born into the world of Maya.  From the moment of birth a Jiva is mired in
Maya so a baby is really no better off than the average ignorant person.
In fact it's in a worse position because he does not have the opportunity
to hear and understand the great vakyas of Shruti.

It is acceptable that the real world is the creation of Saguna Brahman or
Ishwar.  This would be in agreement with the Shruti statements which say
God created the world.  Our dreams are caused by the effect of the world
on our minds.  Of course this is vyavahara.  All such distinctions will
disappear on the achievement of jnana.

I don't have his original post but the basic argument against idealism
is that if each person is in their own world, why is the world of
experience so similiar from person to person?  One would expect more
variety than there is.

I'd be careful of Radhakrishnan.  He's another one of those who quotes
Advaita when it suits him and makes up his own junk at other times.  I
don't think Vedanta is nearly as idealistic as he makes out and in fact
the Advaita Acharyas probably tried to tone down that sort of thing in
order not to appear Buddhistic.

Well then while he was President, why didn't he will Pakistan to stop
fighting against us?  If he's one of the "such men" there is little
hope for the rest of us is there?

If you believe it is possible to report ones experiences, you should see
a lot more variety than there actually is.  If it isn't than we can never
break out of our little worlds yet we seem to be able to manage this
thread well enough :-)
