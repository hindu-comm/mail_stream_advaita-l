OK, let's discuss without mentioning creation/non-creation theories.

I agree!

Agree...

This is something that I'm not interested in.  Also, how can any of these
unreal things have any effect on ANYTHING, much less on Consciousness?

You had said this:

If this is the way experience is happening through your body/mind mechanism
(as Ramesh would say), then the Ultimate Understanding has been rached
through (your) body mind.  The non-event of enlightenment has happened, and
there's no personal do-er left.  Usually in this case, there are no
questions, everything is seen as perfect, unable to be any different.

On the other hand, the quote could be an intellectual understanding.  The
intellect sees it this way, but there is still the tug of emotions, there
are doubts, questions, fears, insecurities, etc.
