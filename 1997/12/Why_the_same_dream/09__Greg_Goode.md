OK, sorry about the heavy Sanskrit.  I'll avoid it in this message.

Well, THIS is not why the non-creation theory exists.  The Hindu creation
theories are theories of emanation, where the effects emanate from the
cause like an oak comes from an acorn.  Their purpose is not to teach you
metaphysics, but to see that everything just IS God.  So that some
Vedantins will say that there is creation, but there is nothing other than
God.  Because everything is God.  No problem.  Everything being God, and
yourself knowing this, you can either subscribe to a creation theory or
not.  Doesn't matter.

You are asking what it is that experiences.  The apparent individual entity
apparently experiences the apparent world.  But in REALITY, there are no
separate experiences or experiencer.  All is an appearance in
consciousness, the experience, the experiencer, everything.  To ask "to
whom is this an experience" is to try to paste the notion of a limited
individual (an experiencer) onto Consciousness, the Absolute.

If you REALLY believe this, or if this is your EXPERIENCE, then how can
there be any questions??  What's the problem, and for whom IS it a problem??
