Nisargadatta's view is not inconsistent with scripture, even though it might
not be based directly on his reading of scripture.  For example, Mandukya
Upanishad I.7:

   It is not that which is conscious of the internal subjective
   world, not that which is conscious of the external world, nor
   that which is conscious of both, nor that which is a mass of
   consciousness, nor that which is simple consciousness, nor is
   is unconscious.  It is unseen by any sense-organ, not related
   to anything, incomprehensible by the mind, uninferable,
   unthinkable, indescribable, essentially of the Self alone,
   negation of all phenomena, the peaceful, all bliss and the
   non-dual.  This is the Atman and this is to be realised.

   (trans. Swami Chinmayananda)

The Upanishad's Atman is Nisargadatta's awareness.

>No paper, no hole.  No consciousness, no beyond consciousness.

Yes, that is the Atman.

Who knows?  It is a single line, part of a dialog that had meaning in the
moment, an instantaneous communication between the sage and a seeker.
Ripped out of context, what meaning is left?

Not surprising, is it?  Everything is related to everything else.  Indra's
Net.  And it's all just appearance in consciousness, none of it ultimately
to be believed!!

You raise an interesting question here.  It's less clear what Nisargadatta
means by 'mind' than by 'awareness' or 'supreme', but I bet Nisargadatta
would agree that the supreme gives rise to both mind and body.  Or "appears
to give rise," because simply "give rise" implies that what has arisen is
real...

This is fine!  In fact most other writers, teachers, scriptures use
Consciousness instead of Awareness.  I'm not aware of anyone other than
Nisargadatta whose words come out into English this way....
