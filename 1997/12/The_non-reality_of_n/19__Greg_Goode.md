Quick question -- what are you referring to, Nisgardatta's *experiential*
nothingness?  I'm under the impression that the ones who deify and reify
nothingness are his followers (who might be more familiar w/Nisargadatta
and perhaps Buddhism than with Hindu scripture and other teachers), but I
didn't think that Nisargadatta himself says that nothingness is an
experiential thing.
