This is a wonderfully apt quote.  It may indeed express exactly what
Nisgardatta had in mind.  But note that, unlike Nisgardatta's texts, and
the way they are interpreted by some of his followers, this passage does
not  turn nothingness into an existent.

In other words, it is non-dual.

*qua* both

but consciousness nonetheless, and not a contentless or pure consciousness.

Nor *beyond* consciousness.

Clearly, it must be beyond the range of the senses as they are commonly
understood to function.

On the view that the Atman is--far from nothingness--an everythingness,
then there is nothing outside it to which it could be "related to".

This would be true of both nothingness and eveythingness.  But, by itself,
it does not substantiate either.   At any rate this passage can not be used
to substantiate Nisgardatta's *experiential* nothingness.

My text has "discerned" instead of realized.  It's an important distinction
here.  Perhaps someone will comment on the Sanskrit.
