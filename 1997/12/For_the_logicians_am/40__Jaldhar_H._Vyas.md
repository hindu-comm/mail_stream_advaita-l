Not really according to Advaita Vedanta following on a tenet of Purva
Mimamsa.  Those Vedic passages which appear to mention plurality are part
of the Karma kanda of the Vedas and are meant to extol rites.  They are
relevant for those who are qualified for rites.  For those who are
qualified to seek Brahman, the Jnana Kanda is relevant and it teaches
non-duality.

It gives us a reasonable suspicion of that plurality but it cannot be
considered pramana until we know 100%.  On a closer look we may find that
it was indeed a whole of lot of ice which caused a mist that looked like
smoke from far away.  In the same maya causes us to misperceive things as
being different.  Closer investigation will tell us they are not.
