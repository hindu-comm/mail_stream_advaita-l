OK, so how'll you calm your mind? How did you know about your favorite
place? How did you know about the method and the goal? Only with the help of
the mind or intellect, itself.

I do agree that we 'already are'. But to remove 'layers ' of ignorance
enveloping the 'Self', the intellect serves as one of the essential tools.
And till you reach an advanced stage, I suppose, the only tool.
