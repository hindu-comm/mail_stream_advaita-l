I was taught this Sanskrit verse as a child, as a prayer to Lord Shiva.
Recently, while watching the movie on Sankaracharya by BV Iyer, to my
pleasant surprise, this verse was recited in the movie and it was
mentioned that it was from one of the Vedas. Can somebody identify this
verse and tell me to which Veda it belongs to and it's meaning,
significance etc :

Vaa karthaa iva samprakthav vaa kartha pradhibhagthayae
jagadhaga pitharav vandhae paarvathi parameshvarav

(Hope I got it right!)

Thanks in advance.
