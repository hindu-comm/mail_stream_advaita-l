sarvebhyo namaaH,
  R^igVeda maNDala 4, suukta 58, mantra 3,
identifies with yaGNa or righteous conduct
which leads to mokSha, final emancipation, in
order to become one with brahman, which is what
we all are searching for because it gives us
eternal bliss. Chanting the mantras helps to
bring us closer to that bliss because the
sounds and vibrations of the aksharas bring
harmony of the earth and universe with the one
chanting.
  Maharashi Dayananda's translation and Purport
of RV maNDala 4, suukta 58, mantra 3 links
the mantras, faith, and knowledge:

  "This yaGNa or righteous conduct has got
four horns in the form of the four Vedas; three
feet in the form of action, contemplation and
knowledge; two heads in the form of worldly
prosperity and emancipation; seven hands in
the form of five senses of perception or action;
antahkaran or inner senses and soul. This mighty,
attainable yaGNa, the giver of all happiness,
interlinked with a triple bond of shraaddha (faith)
puruShartha or industriousness and practice of
yoga, roars loudly and enters into the mortals
being the shower of joy (delights)."

  Both Wilson's and Dayananda's translations
included passages from the Nirukta and Maha-bhashya
as in the following Purport:

  "O men! in this world pervaded by God, yaGNa has
got four horns in the form of the four Vedas, naama
(noun), aakhyaata (verb), upasarga (a preposition
fixed to verb), and Nipaat (indeclinable); vishva,
taijasa, praaGNa and turiiya and dharma (righteous-
ness), artha (wealth, kaama (fulfilment of noble
desire) and mokSha (emancipation); three feet in
the form of three savanas (in the sessions); three
times, i.e. present, past and future; karma, upaasana
(contemplating) and praGNa (knowledge and mind,
speech and body etc.). It has two heads in the
form of vyavahaaya (secular dealing) and paramaartha
(spiritual), two kinds of worlds, eternal and
non-eternal. udgam and praayanaa (uttaraayana and
dakShiNaayana, two solstices) and teacher and
preacher. It has seven hands in the form of gaayatrii
and other principal metres numbering seven, seven
cases of the grammar, seven praaNas, five karmendriya
(senses of action), body and soul. It is bound
by the triple bond of mantras, brahmans (commentaries
on the Vedas with applications in the yaGNas) and
kalpa (rituals) in the chest, neck and head, in the
three bonds of hearing, reflection, and meditation,
and brahmaachaarya), good actions and good thoughts.
Thus accomplished this dealing is great and
venerable, which has delved into the behavior of
mankind. All should know this state of things well."
