Nagy as long as that nothing is something that cannot be negated to nothing!
- sadeva somya idamagramassiit - ekamevaadviteeyam is the sruti. existence
was there before creation it is one without a second.

There has to be someone to negate everything, meaning that someone is a
existence entity and for doing the negation part he must be a conscious
entity.  If that is one without a second it is infinte conquanity or
ananda.  satchitananda has to be there and cannot be reduced to nothing!

Hari Om!
