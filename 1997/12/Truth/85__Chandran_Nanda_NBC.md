As everybody in this list must be aware that there're primarily two states
in Advaitam, ie the vyavahaarika (the object, perceiver state) and the
jeevanmukhta (the realized state), I request the latter not to respond to
the statements of the former, because it takes the importance out of the
statement and is totally out of context and misleading.

I understand and agree with Nageshwar's statement.
