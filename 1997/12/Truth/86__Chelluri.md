                                     Brahmaiva Stayam
                               (Brahman is the only Truth)

Namaste!

To answer  Sri G. Murthy's comments:

1. If EGO  is present one never realizes the Truth.......may be a glimpse!

2. When Truth is realized, Who says to Whom it is Blissful.

3. It could be nothing too!
