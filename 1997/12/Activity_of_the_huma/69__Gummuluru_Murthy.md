Namaste.

The above is a fair question and let me attempt at giving my
understanding and my usage of these words.

We define Reality as what remains immutable during the three states of
waking, dream and deep sleep. It is pure Consciousness.

That which did  not exist before and will not exist after, but is
perceived to exist at the present on account of the peculiar condition of
the mind, we can call it unreal. [Please recall GauDapAda's statement
"Adau ante ca yAn nAsti, vartamAnepi tat tatha": that which did not exist
at the beginning and which is not going to exist at the end may just as
well be considered non-existent at the present.]. Some examples of unreal
are: the mirage, the illusory snake. This is true also of all waking and
dream experiences. Waking, like dream, is unreal since the objects
perceived in the waking state, just like those perceived in the dream,
have their origin solely in the mind.

Swami Nikhilananda says "Whatever object is perceived to exist outside
the perceiver, whether in dream or waking, is unreal on account of its
being perceived. Any experience based on subject-object relationship is
essentially unreal."

There are many illustrations of Real and unreal in AshhTAvakra Gita and
Yoga VashishhTa.
