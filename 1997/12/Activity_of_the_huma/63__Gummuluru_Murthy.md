I would like to pose a friendly question to the list-members. Would
anyone deny the following statement ?

"Whatever activity the human mind indulges in, it is unreal. Whether it is
in a dream-state (taijasa) creating its own world, or whether it is in a
wake-up state (vaisvanara) where it tries to discriminate between
unreality and reality, or enjoys the sensual pleasures or suffers the
worldly miseries, all its activities are unreal. Even its activity of
satsangh or attempts to absorb the scriptural writings are unreal."
