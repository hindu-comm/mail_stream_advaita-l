I for one would certainly not deny it. I am "that I am". All else is unreal
IF it is called anything but that. My experience is this: I am
everything...mind, body, rocks, etc., etc. It's like the bracelet being
called a bracelet when it is merely gold in the shape of a bracelet. Mind is
merely God in the shape of Mind.

Narcissistic gratification here I come!

Thanks for reminding me.
Steve
