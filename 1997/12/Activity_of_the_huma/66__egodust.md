The mind, being the work of maya, is mithya only if considered as distinct
from brahman.  Otherwise it is the saguna aspect, and thus quite real.

Remember that if we regard the sohamidam (isvara, jiva, jagat) as illusion,
we're propounding dvaita.  The illusion is only borne if/when we regard
[it] as being real *as such*--unto itself and isolated from its Substratum.

Namaste.
