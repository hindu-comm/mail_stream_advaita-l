Subject: Joining advaita mailing list

Namaste.

I would like to join the advaita mailing list.  Please let me know how
to do this.

My name is Sanjivendra Nath, and I work at an insurance company in
Chicago.

I have always been interested in the advaita philosophy, starting with
Vivekananda's books, but have been unable to make much progress.
Hopefully, by joining this discussion group, being with the right
company, would help me make at least some progress.

I am 34 years old, married and have 2 children (ages 3 and 5).

Thank you,
Sanjivendra Nath
