The best online resource for this is the INDOLOGY website in UK. See
information about fonts and software at the URL

http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indnet-software.html

There are links from this page to Charles Wikner's Devanagari-TeX package,
and the Itranslator package developed by Swami Vishwarupananda, both of
whom are members of this list. Both make use of transliteration systems
without adding diacritical marks, to use as an input to obtain devanagari
output.

One good font with diacritical marks is John Smith's Indic font package
from Cambridge. There are fonts available for PCs, Macs, and also for
use with TeX. They are rather simple to install and use, and John Smith is
also quite helpful with queries.
