I'll just say this much. In contemporary India, if you are a religious
organization that wants to stand up to communists, you will be branded a
communalist, and you will be seen as being part of the VHP brigade. Not
every religious group wants to be seen that way. Those of us who haven't
experienced the political realities in India may not be able to appreciate
this. It will take at least another decade of India's new policies for
attitudes to change.

Presently, that the political right-wingers have co-opted Vivekananda does
not help the RK math. As for opposing all those who selectively quote
Vivekananda, it seems to me that the RK math is in a situation where they
will be damned if they do, and they will be damned if they don't.
