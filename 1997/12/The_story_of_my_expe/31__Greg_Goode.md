The ancient Greeks were the same way.  'Barbarian' in Greek meant 'not us'.

I agree there!!

What are his dates?

I agree about the RK mission, but is that about modernism?   I used to
attend services at two of their centers, and have my own ideas about why
they are not more popular.  Don't think it has too much to do with
modernism vs. traditionalism.  Or do you mean the RK mission in India?

Wrong about what?  Most people would love it if other people were not
deluded.  How do you know that other traditions, paths, trends, etc., are
false.  Not all non-Vedanta trends are hoodwinking.  You argue for the
cultural purity/integrity of Advaita Vedanta.  This is not a path for
everyone, especially people from other cultures.  This is why there are a
multiplicity of paths.  This prompts me to ask you:  what is your personal
opinion of people like me, an American, strongly drawn to Vedanta?  I'm
drawn both to the orthodox kind, the kind with the long, continuous
guru-disciple tradition, AS WELL as the non-orthodox kind taught by Ramana
Maharshi, Nisargadatta, Ramesh Balsekar (who you mention below), and
others.  You might say that my intereset in the non-orthodox kind is that
I'm being hoodwinked.  But if I am culturally not Indian and don't see
things through the same historical/cultural filter that an orthodox Indian
Vedantist does, then how did my interest happen??  Am I doomed?   I
remember hearing once on another mail-list that the best hope for an
American according to one orthodox writer was to be reborn in India!

Or is what you are saying that you don't like other trends masquerading as
Vedanta when they're not Vedanta?  I can agree with you there.  A friend of
mine made a quip about Advaita being as trendy as "Tao" was a few years
ago.  We'll see books on "The Advaita of Business," "The Advaita of
Relationships," "The Advaita of Getting What you Want," etc.

Agree, agree.  The Truth is eternal, permanent, infinite.

Interesting.  Have you read them?

I know what you are talking about, and Ramana, Nisargadatta are NOT part of
this tradition.  I had looked for instances of this tradition in the U.S.,
and it's sort of hard to find.  Swamis Chinmayananda and Swami Dayananda do
have a presence on the East coast.  Are they part of this tradition?

Could you give an example here of how Vedanta doesn't apply to your
corporate life?  Is mentally chanting OM not applying Vedanta?  Cannot this
be done during a business meeting?

You are arguing here something like both A and B:

A: Greg says (a) that the Gita is profound and transcends culture.  This
view, (a), is probably Greg's personal creation.

B: Jaldhar says (b) that the Gita must be understood only in the same way
it was at the time and in the culture in which it was written.  This view,
(b), is not Jaldhar's personal creation, but something more absolute.

Propositions (A) and (B) don't really go together.  Of course everything
that appears, any view, all nama-rupa is an appearance in consciousness and
ultimately not a personal thing at all.  But even speaking from within the
world of maya and relativity, it is known that literary, religious,
aesthetic views are influenced by one's time, place, background,
conditioning, education, etc.  If you agree to this, then views (a) and (b)
are also both influenced by these same factors!
