There was a time when the RK mission stood for the future.  To people like
my father growing up in the '50s with a traditional background but eager
to take part in the new world unfolding before them, the RK mission
symbolized progress and enlightenment and all that good stuff.  I remember
the last time I went to the RK mission in Rajkot I noticed a sign
forbidding photography of the murtis just like in a real mandir.  A big
difference don't you think!  I agree that some of its monks are scholarly
but that also I think shows a change in their ideology.  Previously their
conception of a sannyasi was a "karma yogi" a sort of social worker which
was obviously an imitation of Christian missionaries.  That they are
paying more attention to traditional sannyasi activities is a good thing
IMO but it means they didn't really convince people with their distinctive
doctrines.  Of course this is the view from Gujarat which is let's face it
a backwater for modern thought.  The situation might be different in the
"heartlands" of RK mission activity.

If people are distorting his views, shouldn't they be setting the public
straight?

This is another example.  There has never been a time in history when it
has been easier to stand up to a Communist especially ones with ideas this
stupid.   Yet they just rolled over.  This hardly squares with their
activist past.

I think the difference between the groups in decline and the ones that are
flourishing (or at least holding their own) is the degree to which
membership requires a commitment.  Take this Swaminarayan Sampradaya for
instance.  It makes no pretense of being "up-to-date" it's moral code is
downright puritanical even by traditional standards yet it has many young
followers over here, including many who are barely aquainted with Gujarat.
In contrast much of what passes as Advaita these days is lightweight,
intellectually confused and has no impact on peoples lives.  The
continuing vitality of Advaita thought depends on these trends being
reversed.
