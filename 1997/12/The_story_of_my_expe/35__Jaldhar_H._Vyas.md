Both Rammohan Roy and Swami Sahajanand where active around the turn of the
18th century.

Perhaps more in India but anywhere, to the Hindu in the street, the RK
mission has stood for modernism.  See my reply to Vidyashankar.

Wrong that tradition will not be able to survive and compete with the
weeds.  I think it can.

Because I know that what I have learnt is what my Grandfather knew and his
Grandfather and so on through the ages.  Because I know the history of the
modern sects and how little they have to do with the Advaita tradition.

More the integrity than the purity.  Vedanta did not occur in a vacuum and
I'm prepared to accept the impact of, say Dvaita polemics, on the system.
But it is precisely because I'm aware of the history and tradition of
Advaita that I can recognize deviations.

Since you asked, I think you've contributed much to this list
with your questions and conversation.  However if you were to announce
tomorrow that you're joining the Jehovah's Witnesses, it wouldn't bother
me a bit.  Basically I think of non-Hindus as tourists.  While you're here
there's no sense in being rude but if you're not here, no big deal.  After
I get married and start teaching children, it will Indians only. (Probably
Gujaratis only.)

It's perfectly natural to be interested in other cultures.  I can
understand that.  What I don't get is why you feel the need to be a
participant instead of an observer?  For instance I'm interested in
Orthodox Judaism.  Living in the New York area, I've had colleagues of
that faith and Kosher dairy restaurants have often helped me out with
reliable vegetarian food.  And I think there are some interesting
parallels between some of their practices and ours.  But I've never felt
the need to go to a synagogue or even to talk to Jews about this.

That is certainly a popular view.

Unfortunately you're probably right.

Neither of these two have much of a following amongst Gujaratis but I've
met some South Indian followers of Chinmayanands.  If they have a fault,
it is that
some of them over-Vedantize everything.  I remember onetime I was doing
Ganapati puja at some persons house and they had a person giving a speech
on the "Vedantic symbolism of Ganesh Bhagawan."  He seemed rather put out
when I told him there wasn't any such thing.  As for Swami Dayanand, I've
heard of him but not much about him which is actually a good thing IMO.
An ascetic isn't supposed to be a social worker or a religious leader, he
is supposed to be off in the mountains somewhere inquiring into Brahman.
The less contact with society the better.

Sannyasa is an indispensible requirement for the serious sadhaka.  I know
this is one of the perennial topics on the list and people will give
instances of householders who are jnanis but realisticly, the person who
is enmeshed in worldly actions such as making money and wheeling and
dealing cannot expect to make any progress.

As for chanting Om during a meeting, i'd fire you if you're mind wandered
off in one of my meetings :-)

Yes, I'm arguing for the supremacy of a certain time, place, background
etc.  And yes it is in some ways arbitrary.  It could have been
interpreted in some other way.  But that's hypothetical.  It _was_
interpreted in the way I'm suggesting.  Maybe the original interpreters of
Advaita Vedanta made a collosal mistake.  But I'm the inheritor of that
collossal mistake not a different one. :-)
