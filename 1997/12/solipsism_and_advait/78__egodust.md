There's a big difference between the idea of 'oneself' and the
reality of the Self which is the universal substratum [beneath]
everyone's 'oneself.'  It could be regarded as the difference
between relative and absolute solipsism; where the relative
version is limiting, splintered, and separative, and the
absolute is expanded, wholistic, and universal.


Namaste.
