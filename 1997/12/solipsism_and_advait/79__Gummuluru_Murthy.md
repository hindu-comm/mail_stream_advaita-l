In the absence of response from learned members of the list, I would like
to put in my two cents worth:

In my  view, advaita deals with what is meant by "you" in "you are real"
                                                  ^^^
statement by Shri Nageswar. It says what "you" are, or to put it more
correctly, what "you" are not. I do not know much about solipsism, hence
cannot comment on it, but advaita, in my understanding, is much more than
"You are real".
