You are comparing two different things.  Yes Vedanta was aimed at elite
but it is only one part of Vedic religion.  And although the Vedas are
also restriced to certain castes, the shastras based on them such as the
Puranas and Ramayana and Mahabharat are open to all.  And one more data
point.  If Buddhism was so conducive to human happiness and Hinduism was
not, why are there no Buddhists and Hindus from Kashmir to Kanyakumari?

If you look at traditional Buddhist societies there doesn't seem to be any
less dogmatism there than in any other religion.
