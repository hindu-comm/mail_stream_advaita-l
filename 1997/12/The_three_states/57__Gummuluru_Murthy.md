I have read similar statements about the deep sleep state that when we
wake up (from deep sleep) we say we had a peaceful or happy sleep etc.
I would like to ask in this context: How could we say that we slept
happily ? Deep sleep, by its very definition, is beyond happiness and
sadness. Can a jeeva in a wake-up state gauge how happy (or sad) the deep
sleep is (unless the reference is to sat-chit-ananda, the bliss without
opposite) ? Further, it is significant that the statement "I slept happily
... " is made only in the wake-up state.
