"The Self is not known through the study of scriptures, nor through
subtlety of the intellect, nor through much learning. But by him who longs
for him is he known. Verily unto him does the Self reveal his true being."

This is the kind of statement which has great scope for misinterpretation.
Does this statement mean that a person can realize his self without the
study of the scriptures, without exercizing his intellect or learning from
relevant sources.

It's true that the longing for liberation is the most important quality. It's also
true that if one studys the scripture as an intellectual exercise rather
than spiritual, there cannot be liberation. But without going thru the path
of learning from the scriptures and learning and exercising the intellect ,
can one get to the the state of liberation? No, it's these three actions fired
by the longing which liberates. Or is it?
