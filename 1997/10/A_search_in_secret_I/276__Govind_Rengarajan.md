        The kAnchi mutt was in kumbakONam before it was
        moved to kAnchIpuram. You can refer to an article by
        Vidyasankar sometime ago (in the archives - sorry I don't
        have the dates). If I am not mistaken, Giri also has some
        information on his homepage:

        Also Ravi or Sri Ram Chandran can perhaps shed more light
        on this.
