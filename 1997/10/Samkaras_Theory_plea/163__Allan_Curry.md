    To be fair to Pugliandla, I think he would disagree that
    unreality exists, by definition. Appearances exist in
    some sense and are distinguished by what can sublate
    them (ie. real being only or real being and/or another
    appearance). The reason why unreality cannot be sublated
    or not sublated is that it can never become an object of
    our experience (ie. horns of a rabbit, etc.). Unreality
    is simply not existing in anyway, anywhere, at anytime.

Your earlier comment:

    ......is more troubling to me. How could Pugliandla be
    right about this being Samkara's criterion of reality
    and forming his ontological hierarchy if Samkara never
    "addresses the process of one edifying experience
    replacing a previously held mistaken judgement"? Perhaps
    Puligandla is editorializing along the lines of saying
    "it all boils down to this" even though Samkara never
    explicitly says so ... ?
