Namaste,

I wish I knew, but don't... that's why I was asking!

    I've since returned "Fundamentals of Indian Philosophy"
    to the library so I'm unable to quote it to you, but, I
    do remember Pugliandla mentioning there were 3 kinds of
    appearance (I couldn't see much difference between 2nd
    and 3rd though). They were distinguishable on the basis
    of being sublatable by other appearances as well as the
    ontological ground as opposed to being sublatable by the
    ontological ground only. The moon would be an instance
    of an appearance of the last type while a hologram of
    the moon would be an instance of the former type.

      That's another good question I don't have an answer to
    but my guess would be that Sankara does not hold
    "experience to be a superior pramana..." How could he
    have said otherwise and still be the patron saint of
    Advaita *Vedanta*?
