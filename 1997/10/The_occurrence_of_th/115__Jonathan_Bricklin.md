I'm not sure what you mean in this context by "have a practical use only."
It almost sounds tautological:  they have a use only when they are used,
i.e., are put into practice.  Perhaps you are being a pragmatist, like
James,
who believed that all concepts are to be judged by their practical
consequences.   The concept of God could be so judged, as could Advaita.
They are not usually part of the conscious foreground of moment to moment
experience, but any given moment at any given time can be referred to them.

A belief or disbelief in Fate and the non-reality of free will can also be
judged only by their practical consequences, but that is a different
thread.  To start that thread you need to distinguish what you see as the
practical consequences that the differing beliefs would entail.

moments, no still reference point.  Admittedly "arise" can be a misleading
term, in the same way that it is ultimately misleading to say that the sun
"rises."  Perhaps "occur" is a better word.

Why is this infinitude of thoughts from one source any different than
standard Advaitin metaphors such as  the one sun being reflected by many
different surfaces of a mirror?  The advaitin metaphors emphasize the
illusion of disjunction through space.  But all space is now known to be
space/time.

Dear Charles;
Thanks for your thoughtful thoughts.

        Thought is an outcome experienced by the intellect under the influence
of factors that include Intuition, Intellect, Impulse and BELIEFS.
These factors are interdependent, interactive and overlapping.
        Some thoughts also come from mystic experiences with no explanations.
Thoughts during dreams,  meditation, and prayers are examples of mystic
experiences.  Those thoughts are dominated by beliefs.
        When the mathematician gets a solution for a problem, such thoughts
come from knowledge-based intuition.  Thoughts based on knowledge can be
cultivated through reading, learning and training.
        Belief is subjective and complex without coherent explanation. Belief
evolves from a variety of sources that include knowledge, perception,
impulse and intuition. Perception is also subjective and is greatly
influenced by beliefs.
        Already this thought-process do not take us anywhere and get into a
loop with no return!
Destiny is greatly influenced by belief where as freewill is an
expression of challenge against belief. But freewill is a belief against
the belief!
        I am more comfortable to declare thoughts as just THOUGHTS without
explanations.  When I attempt to explain, I am able to recognize my
stupidity! Finally, I recognize that any logical explanation of my
thought-process is my own creation. It is an illusion coming from my
ignorance.
