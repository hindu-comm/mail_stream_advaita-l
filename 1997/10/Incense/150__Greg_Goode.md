Does anyone burn incense?  Any recommended kinds?  I like Satya Sai Baba's
nag champa, and a local brand sold in Brooklyn called "Shahada."

Thanks!

Dear Greg: Namasakar.

        In India burning incense is an integral part of worship.  There are
many Gods and many incenses.  Such choices (God and incense) varies
according to individual belief and taste! I generally prefer the one
with sandal base.  Sandal wood trees are grown in South India (mostly in
Mysore/Kerala states) and they have pleasant natural aroma.  If you go
to any Indian Grocery stories in New York/New Jersy area, you should be
able to find many varieties with sandal base.
        Your selection seems pretty reasonable and why bother to change it.
Religion and Incense have many common qualities. They both serve the
humanity. They are available for everyone's use.  People can access them
whenever they need. They both want to purify the human environment. They
want to make people feel pleasant. Those who don't like have the option
to abandon them!
        I believe that what you were looking for is already within you! You
just need to convince your mind to accept your choice!
Have a nice day and Enjoy the Aroma of your selection.

Ram
