Of course.  I think that all mind patterns are associative.  Any other
kinds of relations are superimposed over these.

I know all this -- in fact, in grad school speaking of decision theory
and ethics, we used to remark how all decisions seemed to start lacking
force and import as the object of the decision becomes more remote from
the decider.  More remote in terms of time, space, familial/genetic distance,
probability of outcome, or any other relation.

By I-thought, it seems you really mean any thought that occurs while there
is identification.  Identification with ANYTHING entails ignorance.  The
infinite consciousness is what it is, it simply is.  Any identification
with anything else entails some sort of duality, ignorance.  And
this is just what Ramana meant.  When I asked this question to the list, I
was
just checking.  Just to see if the I-thought was something else, e.g.,
a thought where "I" is the OBJECT of the thought.  Like a "pot-thought" is
a thought of a pot.

Yes, familiar with this.

And all this.

There's only one real observer, the unseen seer, which, seeing, allows
any identified entity to see.

They are!

Actually, the way you explain the I-thought is very much the same as
Ramana's explanation!

The Brahmans/illusory-appearances explanation always works for me,
whereas the choice notion never works :-)
