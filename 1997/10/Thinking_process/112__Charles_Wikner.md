Both: English for skimming and Sanskrit for penetration. The point
is to study the words of the wise in their own language, without
the interpretations of a translator.  So the most useful text is
one that has both, e.g. in the format of Sadananda's post.

I don't much care for the opinions of onlookers, albeit disciples,
or for transcriptions of conversations because the level is so
dependent on the disciple: I assume that most publication are in
this vein.  But Ramana's _own_ writings intended for publication
should be worth examining.

Charles.
