Hi Allan!

You have sent a series of brilliant emails. Well done! You are doing an
important service. In this email your heart shone through.

I wish I could express things as clearly as you. I'm wondering... have you
got a degree in law or something? Do you know a good book on logic that is
simple and digestible? Edward de Bono made a clear description of the
redundance of logic but I now realise logic can be used to expose corrupt
thinking.

Regards,

Martin.

Dear Allan:

Namaskar

        You have written a beautiful note and it touched my heart and soul.  I
was very happy to read your clarification and the "you in me" wants to
support your cause.  If you are looking for any books or other
literatures related to these issues, I will try to collect and send you
as soon as possible. Please send me an E-mail.  My intuition tells me
that you sincerely want to learn and understand the Hindu Scriptures. I
hope to help you in any way I can in your pursuit of TRUTH.

Thanks for the piece (also peace) from Katha Upanishad....

With my regars and Have a nice day!

Ram Chandran
