This sublation is essentially the same thing as the Indian concept of
"Arundhati-darsananyaya," a method of teaching something unfamiliar to
the student.  It is a method of spottng the tiny star Arundhati with
the help of the bigger star near it, and calling the latter Arundhati.
Later the student will be able to make out the smaller star itself.

Swami Vireswarananda explains this in his Introduction to the
Shankara-commentary-edition of the Brahma-Sutras, and also says that
many Indian teachers employ this method of instruction going from
lower to higher truths.

This seems clear to me -- because anything in phenomenality
presupposes duality.  To me, this theory doesn't help me understand
Shankara any better.

But it seems to me that this explanation is mostly in accord with
Shankara.  In the part of Puligandla's text that I deleted, he spoke
about grades of reality.  I don't know if Shankara really believed
that reality has ontological grades.  Maybe successive sublated truths
are closer to reality than others.

To me, an aphoristic way to present Shankara's concept of reality to
someone is as follows (I first read it somewhere, and can't find the
quote anymore):

     Brahman is real.
     The world is unreal.
     The world is Brahman.

Which makes the world both real and unreal outside the aphorism.
