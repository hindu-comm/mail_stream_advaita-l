Which teachers confer the instant enlightenment thing?  Many of the
teachers I've seen are Western, and DO say that we're all enlightened,
but we just don't realize it.  They also say that we don't need all the
years of effort, struggle, breaking 2000 Zen koans, years of chanting,
brahmachari and prostration, etc.  Just see the world the way they do,
they say.  But I haven't seen a teacher that proclaims him/herself as a
savior.

Several ways I've heard of that, ah, don't come from the scriptures.  One:
Does the person exude peace?
Does the person treat everyone more or
  less the same, or are there obvious favorites?
Are they overly interested in money?  Sex?

Also, other than looking out for obvious frauds and dangerous situations, we
might have to acknowledge that we won't always know about others'
enlightenment.

I myself get an uneasy feeling about some teachers, like a psychic
feeling about selfishness, and ego.  It sort of reaches out and pierces my
"subtle body."  I haven't yet placed confidence in a teacher who has turned
out
to be a fraud or selfish or otherwise unsuitable.

I've heard the same things about an RM "lineage."  At least one teacher's
national
organization decided to remove the word "lineage" from their promotional
material,
after receiving some criticism.  Some of RM's devotees I've met (who do not
go to
any living teacher at all) have told me that RM was very specific about NOT
appointing anyone to teach, or to be a successor.  And I agree, haven't
ever seen
anything in any RM material anything to the contrary.

Great question!
