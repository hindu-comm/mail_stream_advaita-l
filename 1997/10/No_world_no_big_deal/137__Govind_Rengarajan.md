        Any "claim" would make me uneasy.

        *Traditional* schools (maTams) in India, which might appear
        dogmatic to some, really focus on developing a student's
        chitta suddhi. This might take place in the form of learning
        some part of the vedAs, learning shlokAs, etc. I really
        think it will lead the student (a sincere student) to the
        stage what shankarA requires as pre-requisites for
        undertaking the study of brahman (BSB I.I.1).
        All the vedAnta schools incidentally recognize the
        need for chitta suddhi before realization (they differ
        in what you actually realize). When someone like
        Sri Ramana Maharshi comes along, it can be viewed as
        a bonus, a divine signal that such a study (of brahman)
        is indeed worthwhile. And not to mention his grace.
        As Giri pointed out once (probably many times ;-),
        a physical Guru will appear when a student
        is ready. Until then, imo, the focus should really be on
        purification of mind. As Ram Chandran pointed out, it is
        divine grace that will finally deliver.
