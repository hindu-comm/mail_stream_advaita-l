    I was just explaining the basis of my guess. Because
    Samkara holds the position he does in history, it is
    unlikely he would have held "experience to be a superior
    pramana...". I didn't mean to imply that his reason for
    holding that view was to attain a place in history.
    Perhaps my writing style needs improving? Sorry for any
    misunderstanding it may have caused you...


cheers!
