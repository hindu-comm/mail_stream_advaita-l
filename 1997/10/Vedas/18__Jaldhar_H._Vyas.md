Yeah fancy it.  I don't recall his views on the infallability of the Vedas
even entering into the picture yet.  I doubt if they are different to what
I have said.

Did anyone say he wasn't doing a brilliant job and needed any help.
(Btw "us followers"?  I thought you said you didn't care about Vedanta?
Ramana was a Vedantin you know.)

The Vedas only have two subjects Dharma and Brahman.  No contradictions
have been proven there.  (Perhaps and it isn't certain a contradiction
has been shown in the Vedantic opinion of Buddhism but that isn't part of
the Vedas anyway.) As for contradictions on other subjects.  Noting that
is hardly profound.  There are at least 5 different theories of creation
and some shastras recommend the worship of Shiva Bhagawan and some of
Vishnu Bhagawan.  It is highly implausible that no one has noticed this
for thousands of years.

Overall not much help to the modern nitwits I'm afraid. :-)
