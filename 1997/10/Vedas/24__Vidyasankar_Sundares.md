Which is itself a symbol of the great silence, which is described as the

The karmakANDa promises heaven to those who do certain enjoined actions
and hell to those who defy some prohibited actions.

The jnAnankANDa points out that this heaven and hell are not final resting
places, as we keep returning to embodied life. The vedAntic notion, in
both advaita in viSishTAdvaita, is that everybody can attain moksha. The
dvaita school promises an eternal hell for some, but as in other things,
the dvaita tradition is quite alone in holding to such a tenet.
