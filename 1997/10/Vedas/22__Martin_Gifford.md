Since people claimed their infallibility.

I am not interested in how you treat the Vedas. I am concerned about the use
of the word infallible.

Concise Oxford Dictionary.... Infallible = "Incapable of erring, unfailing."

As an aside I noticed at the beginning of the same page of the Concise
Oxford Dictionary (1964) the first word was ineffable = "Unautterable, too
great for words. " That's what I'm interested in!

(What a remarkable co-incidence! The first word on the page was ineffable
and the last word on the page was infallible!)
