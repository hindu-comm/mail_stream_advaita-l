I am not suggesting that argumentation is some litmus test of being an
astika.  There are many orthodox people who as you suggest do not engage
in debates.  It would be hard to master all the shastras in 120 years let
alone 12.  Traditionally people only did an in-depth study of Vedanta if
they were sannyasis.  Nevertheless in his own field of study I am willing
to bet he would have brooked no criticism.  You know first hand the way
Veda is traditionally taught.  The boys are not allowed to progress one
step further until they have mastered their current lesson.  The Acharya
acts swiftly and without equivocation to correct any errors.  It is only
because of this vigor that the tradition of Vedic study has remained
intact for thousands of years.  The same goes for Vedanta and any other
field of study.

There are many questions that people ask which I do not like but you
cannot expect strangers to have a priori knowledge of what is a good or
bad question.  Rather you have to look at the spirit it is asked in,
whether the questioner is genuinely seeking knowledge.  That's how I took
Allans question and that's how I answered.  What is more disrespectful?
To give someone an answer they may not want to hear or to toss aside their
questions as if they were worthless?

Intellectual rigor and a willingness to confront error are a hallmark of
our way.  The idea that we can be in two minds about the Siddhanta ("the
straight path") is an alien notion one which was only introduced by the
modern weeds in the garden of Vedanta.  They are the "modern nitwits" I
referred to.  Those who mislead honest sadhakas are worthy of choicer
epithets than nitwit.

I don't blame you in the least for not knowing  the context.  I for one am
only offended by those who make a virtue out of being dense.

This is Shankaracharyas view.  However he was equally firm that the only
person who could successfully reach that paravidya was one who had
renounced everything.  For all those who aren't sannyasis it is indeed a
package deal.

The reason much of the world is spiritually impoverished is because of
overzealous chaff-seperating.  When I look back at the influences on my
life it was greater lesson to have learned to say "Jai Ambe" when I sneeze
than to have learned the Upanishads.  The same goes for any other culture.
One can only progress far on firm foundations.

It's a noble aim but it's doomed to failure for the same reason all other
previous attempts have failed: These are not your roots.  Western cultures
have their roots but you (collectively) have made a decision to reject
them.  That's what it means to be modern.  Modernity  has many benefits
but has exacted a psychic price.  I don't think the exoticism of a foreign
culture is going to help.

Not for me anyway.
