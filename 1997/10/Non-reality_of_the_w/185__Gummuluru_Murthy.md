Now, I have a question in this regard.

First, let me illustrate.  We see waves. We see all waves to be the same
as water only. Then we see water from different oceans. We see them as
water only and not as different oceans. We see oceans and continents and
we see that as the Earth only. Then we see the earth as one of the nine
planets. Then we do not see the nine planets but only a solar system. Then
we see the Sun as one of the stars and the whole as one cosmos. Then we
do not see the cosmos but we see only one nishchalatvam, the perfect
quietness, the nirguna brahman, the substratum of all.

This may not be a good illustration, but I would re-phrase Shri Madhavan's
question this way: why see the difference and then interpret it as that
perceived difference is due to ignorance ? If we do not see the difference
at all, then where is the need for interpretation ?

In the bhagavad-gita verse quoted above, Krishna seems to see a difference
and then interprets the difference. My question is, why does a jnani like
Krishna see a difference ?

I also refer here to the example given by Shri Ram Chandran from
Mahabharata regarding Krishna asking Duryodhana and Yudhistara to find a
good man and a bad man respectively and that they couldn't find because
Yudhistara saw only good in everyone and Duryodhana only bad in everyone.
Thus, what one sees is a reflection of one's personality.

Thus, I would assume a jnani like Krishna sees only non-duality in
everything. Isn't seeing non-duality in everything better ("better" is
not the right word here, but I am not sure which word is better.) than
seeing duality and interpreting it as only a superposition ?

I would be grateful for clarification.
