There lies the whole problem. We cannot give up life! (I am not including
suicide here).  We may replace one set of circumstances with another. That
is all. We only replace one thought with another; `it is a snake' with
`it is a rope' and `it is a mirage' with `it is water'. But the `it' still
remains without the labels snake/rope or water/mirage. That `it' cannot be
thrown off. The fact that a mirage is acknowledged shows that it appears.
The problem seems to be in the way we define reality. Choose your own
definition of reality and play the game of partitioning the event space into
the real and non-real. Quite a cheap thrill isn't it?

Srinivas Sista.
