Hello Mr.Ravi Mayavaram and Mr.Govind Rengarajan,

        Thanks for your Welcome mail.

        I would like introduce my-self as S.Balasundaram working
in Tata Elxsi(India) Ltd at Bangalore.

        I find that many concepts in Advaita Philosophy are applicable
in day to day life. And I would like follow Advaita Philosophy in my
life. I hope that by enroling in Advaita list I will be able to seek
the help of other members in understanding mare about Advaitam.

        So I kindly request you enrole me as member of Advaita list.

        Thanks.

With Best Regards,

S.BALASUNDARAM
