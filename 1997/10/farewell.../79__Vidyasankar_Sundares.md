Dear list members,

This will be my last post for a while. Don't worry, I'm not leaving
because I'm offended with somebody or anything.

The simple reason is that I will be away in India for a month or so,
without email access. I will be defending my dissertation after coming
back to Caltech in November. Private emails can still be sent to
vidya at cco.caltech.edu, but I'll only be able to reply to them after
November 15. Till then, au revoir.

Vidyasankar
