Have fun in India.  Wish you well defending your dissertation.  When I did
mine at the University of Rochester, there was an open invitation to all
comers at the University.  I had to defend a prospectus of the dissertation
in front of the public.  The real defense was later, behind closed doors in
the Philosophy Department.  Still was a bit tense, since that single
one-hour session can veto the entire x-years' worth of work and nix your
career.
