This is an important point.  The repeated return of the ego
or sense of individuality is not cause to whip or berate
one's self.  It, like many other things, is something that
happens spontaneously in phenomenality.  To react to the
arising of the ego by saying "my sadhana is not working"
or some other judgment just encourages the ego and makes
it that much more stubborn.
