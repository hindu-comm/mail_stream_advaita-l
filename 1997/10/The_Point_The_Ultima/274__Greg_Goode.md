Thanks for posting all of this.  I would be interested in seeing ASMI.
580KB is not that large.  You could either:

   1. Email it by pasting the whole thing in a message.
   2. Email it by attaching it as a file to be sent, but
      not all mailers allow this.
   3. Putting it on an ftp or web site for downloading.

Try emailing it to me:  goode at dpw.com

Thanks!
