A person without much morality may need to feel guilty in order to
progress further.

Only a basically moral person can feel the pangs of a guilty conscience.
Psychopaths don't at all.   People who feal guilty usually do so because
they've done something wrong.  They may not want to admit it but _that_ is
within duality.

Because the alternative to being moral is being immoral which is worse.

Then you heard wrong.  Vedanta means the end part of the Vedas or if you
will the culmination of the Vedas.

For ending knowledge I recommend beating your head repeatedly with a blunt
instrument.  That ought to end it pretty quickly.
