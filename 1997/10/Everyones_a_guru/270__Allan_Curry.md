    Yes, there certainly are "lots of Western teachers"
    and they certainly do claim or directly imply they
    *are* enlightened and *are* qualified to answer questions
    about Advaita Vedanta from a position of authority, etc.
    (but *not* on Advaita-L, I guess!)

    I get the impression it doesn't matter to many of you
    whether or not such people are mistaken. I find that
    hard to fathom but what the heck, I'll just drop it.
