Namaste Nageswar,
  Regarding your inquiry, "shi" in "shiva"
means "auspiciousness, good fortune, peace,
composure, calm; "va" also means "auspiciousness",
as well as "reverence".
  "Auspiciousness" is the key word here,
I believe, because Shiva is known as "the
Auspicious One" and was assigned the office
of creation and reproduction, as well as
dissolution.

dhanyavaadaH,
  Mantralaura
