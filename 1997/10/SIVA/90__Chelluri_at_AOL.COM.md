                                               Om

Thank You very much for providing the meaninhg of the letters in Siva.

Now "Aham Shiva" OR "shivoham" means I am auspicious.  "I" refers to Nageswar
(me) or "I" could mean the self.   Asuuming the "I" refers to self what
happens to the other "I" referring  to Nageswar.   Am I not auspicious.
  That is what I want to findout.   Your response helped a great deal.

Blessings                                                  Nageswar
