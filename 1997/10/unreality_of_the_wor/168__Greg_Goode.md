This is a very important point.  So we don't think that the universe
disappears only upon realization of the Absolute.  It already IS
non-existent.

Why this concept?  Maybe because of pain and fear.  It's easier to bask in
the realization of the illusoriness of the world when things are going are
way.  Easy to withdraw the senses and mind.  But let a bill collector come
to your job, flunk a physics class, or go in for an HIV test, or witness a
family member getting mugged.  These have a way of riveting the attention,
and the object of our attention is something that is easy to be taken
as real.  It's like our mind getting jerked away from Reality towards
something coming from the senses or the mind.  It's Grace that allows us to
see reality through these things, as it is Grace that allows us to see
reality when things are pleasant.
