'Objective' means you are separate from that which you observe. How could
you know or prove that you are separate? Science creates conceptual objects
and then analyses their creations!

It's purpose is to understand the universe.

Science and religion are both are about concepts.

Science tells us to believe in separate objects and then to explore what you
believe. Gurus tell us to break away from all falsely held concepts like our
supposed identity as a separate object.
