        This is perhaps true as far as the realized person is
        concerned! At the lowkika level some of us live in (in
        ignorance no doubt!), the boundary seems far from thin.

        Of all the dangerous things, the ego assuming the role of
        paramAtmA is the most dangerous. If we *need* to repeat
        ad infinitum "we are paramatma", then the "we" is
        being identified with body/mind/ego, and this situation
        is dangerous. However, seeking the source of "we" or "i"
        is quite different.

        I would simply learn  (with a lot of patience, thought, and
        training) to see paramAtmA everywhere. Then this, as Sri
        Ramana Maharshi points out, will lead one naturally to see
        God in oneself, or God as oneself, or one as a part of God
        (he says why bother about the end result?). It reminds me of
        a short story about a porter and a pandit that Giri once
        posted (must be in the archives).
