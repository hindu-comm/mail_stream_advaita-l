My view on this is the following:

Please recall Swami Vivekananda's statement in his London speech that
"In Hindu philosophy, we go from a lower truth to a higher truth".

Thus, the question posed in the subject ""I" - the mind or the self ??",
both are correct depending on our level of understanding of the Self.

I sometimes wonder why we consider ourselves to be ignorant. Is it
modesty ?  Or, is it our frank opinion of ourselves that we have not
realized the Truth and that we will never realize the Truth ? Further,
if we persisted on with that feeling (that we are ignorant and we are
under bondage), is there ever salvation for us ? Please remember that,
in advaita, it is here and now, our moksha is here, not after discarding
this body.

If we keep on saying that we are ignorant, this life will be over in that
same stage. The boundary between being a realized person and one being
ignorant is very thin. There is no discontinuous jump from one to the
other. Then, is there any advantage in repeating to ourselves ad infinitum
that we are in bondage of our miseries. On the contrary, I would argue
that we should repeat ad infinitum that we are ever free and that we are
paramatma.
