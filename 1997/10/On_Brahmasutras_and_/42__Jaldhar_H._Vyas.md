As others have pointed out, this theory was put forward in the 19th
century by George Thibaut and I don't think it would carry too much weight
today.

One legitimate criticism might be that certain of the Brahma Sutras seem
to espouse a role for karma in the pursuit of moksha.  Shankaracharya
argues vehemently for the total seperation of karma and jnana.  However
the key is "seem too".   The sutras are so brief it is not easy to tell
when one topic ends and the next begins.  The view I just mentioned also
involves assumptions which are as unsupportable as the ones Shankaracharya
is supposed to have made.

I don't know about Vishishtadwaita but Dvaita has given us some of Indias
greatest logicians.  Vyas Tirth was the greatest.  The polemics between
Advaita and Dvaita are classics of philosophy.

I think you are asking too much from logic.  It was long the dream of
logicians to one day create a system which was completely provable based
on its own tenets.  But work by Godel, Frege etc. in the early decades of
this century conclusively proved that _no_ logical system can be complete
in this way.  All depend on postulates which cannot be proven from within
the system.  This applies as much to sciences like geometry as to Vedanta.
For Vedanta the postulates we accept, our basic principles are the
statements of Shruti.  To "prove" the validity of Shruti from within
Vedanta will always end up in tautology.  This doesn't mean Vedanta is not
a logical system.
