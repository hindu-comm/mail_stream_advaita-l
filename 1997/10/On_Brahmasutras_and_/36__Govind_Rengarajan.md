        This point was addressed for a different reason in an
        earlier post of mine (reproduced below). In Sri Vaishnava
        sampradAyam, bhakti and prapatti (complete surrender) are
        valid means for mOkshA. Prapatti is prescribed for
        someone who is unable to engage in bhakti mArgA for
        whatever reason (for e.g., one's station in this life).
        What this implies is that even if one is unable to follow
        one's dharmAs properly, a complete unconditional surrender
        will lead to mOkshA. IMO, prapatti is more difficult
        than following the bhakti mArgA, thanks to our ego.

        If you (or anybody else) need more information, we can
        carry the discussions in private.

        Just so that this point is clarified, there are two schools
        of thought in the visishtAdvaita (Sri Vaishnava) tradition
        (both belonging to Sri rAmAnujA tradition). One school
        emphasizes the need for *complete* surrender which in itself
        takes place only under God's grace. Whereas, the other
        school prescribes two paths - one, *complete* surrender
        (prapatti), and the other, a bhakti mArgA with dedicated
        and devoted practise of one's visEsha dharmA.

        In the former school, free will is given importance only so
        much as to be willing to receive God's compassion and grace.
        In the latter school, the necessity of free will at the
        vyAvahArikA level is recognized, and is encouraged (towards
        turning one's mind in a single-minded devotion to God).

        PS: This post was not meant to be a digression in
        the discussions of free will in the advaita tradition,
        but only to clarify the Sri Vaishnava philosophy in these
        matters.
