Ultimately Atma or Brahman observes thoughts.  Some teachers use a
teaching concept called the "witness."  This would be unidentifed,
impersonal consciousness, the consciousness attributed to the sage.
Where do the thoughts arise from?  Silence, same place they return to.
Why THOSE thoughts?  Vasanas.  Ultimately, it's inexplicable, like
what Shankara says of maya itself:  "unspeakable."

In the relative level, yes.  But at a higher level, all these items
partake of the same reality/unreality as everything else in the
phenomenal world.  The "individual," its "nature," the vasanas and
thoughts are evanescent appearances in consciousness.

This isn't always easy, but if the attention IS elsewhere, then the thought
does disappear.  Not that the person can (always) do anything about it!

Not necessarily a decision.  True, the body/mind does one thing rather than
another.  Which thing it does is based on everything in the universe. The
"decision" comes in when there arises a thought "I" that comes to take
credit for the thing done.


>What is it that observes this "interplay between opposing
>thoughts"?

That which observes everything.  Our true nature, Brahman, which even observes
the dissolution and creation of universes.  The personal or impersonal
"witness"
is itself a concept, an arising in consciousness.

It really SEEMS that way, doesn't it?
But that response itself, along with the ideas that seem like intelligence
are THEMSELVES thoughts/appearances that arise (totally unbidden) in the
silence of infinite consciousness.  There's nothing you can name or point
to which is NOT such an appearance.  As Shankara might say, these appearances
are both real and unreal.  Real, in that experience cannot be denied.  Unreal,
in that they come and go, are not eternal, and depend on being seen in order
to exist.

The unreal ego appeared to perform a logical operation and come to an unreal
conclusion.  None of these elements has any more or less reality or
ontological
existence than any other element.
