        Here is a simple example that illustrates a reality in which there
are both fate and free will (while in some sense defining them both).
Think about a drunk man walking on a street. You cannot predict his next
step (no precognition here :).  So the entity which you observe has a
"free" will. At the sametime the path he has taken before the present time
is a fated path for you.  In other words you can make the perfectly valid
statement that the man was *fated* to take the path that he took. As
you make these statements you are clearly assuming that you *cannot* have
a complete knowledge of the entity, but that *some* unknown factors are
governing its behaviour.  Those unknown factors comprise its fate and they
also comprise his "free" will.  Now bring in precognition in the following
way: suppose you "come to know" the path that the man will take in the
next four moves.  Look at what has happened when you got this knowledge:
you extended your role from an observer to somebody who is evolving with the
observed.  In other words you have started willing that the man takes the
steps in the way you want him to.  So the world now comprises not just
the man but you and the man-- both evolving. Consequently a third observer
can say that both of you are having "free" will and again that both of you
have a fate.

        When this happens, in the picture of reality that was just
presented, the observer is the observed.  There is no need to think about
will and fate.  Thought limits its roles.  But that is a physiologically
different state of existence.  It is impossible to think about it.
