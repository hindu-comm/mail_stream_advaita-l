        Yes and no.  Yes because I am trying to emphasise a freedom which
defies prediction.  No because I am stating the fact that there is an
observer who sees or knows of this freedom.  This last part is what is
used to talk about the will. That there is this quality of the "mind"to
reflect and observe.  It is this quality which sees "free will".  You
cannot deny it (for whatever denies it is the entity itself...), and as
long as you have it you always have an observer, free will and fate. So
coming back to the simplistic example that I used:  the drunk man is the
body and the observer is that quality of the "mind" which one calls the
reflective quality.

        The point is this.  As long as the observer in you knows that you
have a choice (that is there are undetermined factors which allow for this
choice) it has a "free" will.  As long as the observer exists you will
have this "problem".  It doesnot matter to this observer that the choices
are determined by other factors and therefore are not "his". The point
that I was trying to make (and obviously failed to make :) was that this
free will and fate exist as long as there is an observer and an observed.
And that both exist in the way that I pointed out.

        This is really for you to infer from the simple picture that has
been put forth.  If you appreciate the reality of this difficulty that I
am trying to express then welcome to this world. Otherwise you are
banished to the other-world :-)

        The very same entity that possesses and hungers and does all this
dance of life. It is really no-thing.
