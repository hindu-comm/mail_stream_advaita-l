Are you inferring free will from our inability to predict the drunk's
next step?  The same argument would establish free will in a young
puppy scampering around the back yard....

Whether it's fated or not depending on the observer?  Interesting point...

It's not necessary to know all the determining factors in order to say
an action is determined.  It's enough to know that free will doesn't
exist as a reality.  (Though there is a view in Western philosophy
called "compatibilism," which holds that there is free will along
with determinism.  You have free choices, but they are determined
by other factors.)

What IS it that could constitute the person's free will?  To what
entity does free will belong?  The actions coming through a human
mind/body organism cannot be other than what they are, they're
determined by the tastes, values, conditioning, genetics, etc.
of that organism.  If the organism is the subject, then actions
are happening, but no will.  For that you have to have a choosing
entity (and even then, as William James points out, it's a matter
of competing impulses, the strongest one winning out).  What kind
of thing would this entity be?

I like this last paragraph!!!!
