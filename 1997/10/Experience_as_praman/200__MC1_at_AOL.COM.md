Try looking at Rambachan's, Accomplishing the Accomplished; Univ of Hawaii
Press. He deals extensively with the issue of Sankara's views on pramana and
concludes without equivocation that sruti pramana, not experience, is the one
acceptable authority on matters of the Self. He also cites various well-known
authors who get this wrong.
