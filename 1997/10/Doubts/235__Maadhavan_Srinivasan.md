Hi Friends,

I have following doubts abouts Jeevan Mukthas(Self Realized Persons) .

 1. If Jeevan Mukthas have some health problems,how they handle it?
    (If they think that they are not just physical body but
Brahman,then how come they suffer by health problem?)

 2. If Jeevan Mukthas affected by Mental Problems then how can they
utilize their wisdom?

 3. Is there any persons in advaita list who realized SELF?

With Regards,
S.Madhavan.
