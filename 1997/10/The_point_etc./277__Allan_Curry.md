This speaks volumes to me, thanks for it...

    I remember Poonja say in his last book that all desire
    is a hindrance *except* the one true desire to be free
    (ie. realize truth). For this desire he "unequivocally"
    recommends we fan the flame and throw our entire lives
    into the fire. Perhaps there is a difference between a
    particular ego's fantasy about that ego realizing
    something and the genuine desire for liberation which
    originates beneath and before the ego arises and
    accomplishes the end of the ego? After all, a burning
    desire for liberation is one of the requisites for
    moksha listed in traditional texts isn't it?
