Yes, you're right.  Sorry, I shouldn't have said "unequivocally,"
because this makes it seem like teachers are unanimous,
and they aren't.  Andrew Cohen is another one who says that
an intense desire is mandatory.  I think what they are referring
to is the cleansing of the mind that happens.  The desire,
towards the end, if it turns into a love of the Lord, can end
up merging the seeker with Ishwara, and you'll end up with the
bhakti=jnaana situation.  But in the case of the seeker seeing
himself as a seeker and desiring Enlightenment as a foreign
object to be gained, I don't see how this can lead to
Enlightenment.  Seems like this process just reinforces the
ego's picture of itself as separate.  Maybe I'm wrong, and any
intense desire culminates in the merging with its object, and
since there's only one thing in the universe (consciousness),
the merging will be with Consciousness.

Seems to me that the there are OTHER situations that intense
desire can lead to that might be mistaken for enlightenment,
such as a blissful state of mind (like that induced in cultists),
but true Enlightenment?

BTW, Andrew Cohen has been accused of being cultish.  I've heard
of other teachers being accused of this, but no non-dualist
teachers that I can think of...

Please, someone enlighten me on this :-)
