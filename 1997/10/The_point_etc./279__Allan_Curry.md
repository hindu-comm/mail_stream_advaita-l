Yes, you're right (IMO) about Enlightenment not being an
Unidentified Foreign Object (ie. separate from the seeker).

P.S.

By saying Poonja and Andrew Cohen suggest mandatory desire
for freedom while "non-dual teachers" do not, are you
implying Poonja and Andrew are not non-dual teachers?
You'll get no argument from me one way or the other
on that score, I was just curious about your opinion
of them.
