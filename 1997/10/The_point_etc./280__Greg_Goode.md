Maybe I MEANT to say that I didn't know any OTHER non-dual teachers who
insisted on intense desire, and really meant to include Papaji and Andrew
Cohen as teachers of non-dualism.  I'd say that is their ontological view,
at least.  Sorry, I'm not typing my best today, working at a really busy
computer Help Desk, and trying to mentally multi-task.
