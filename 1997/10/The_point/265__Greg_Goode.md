I agree on all your stated points of agreement!  Plus, agree on your
statement of the spirit of Karma Yoga, as well as with the identity of the
field and the knower of the field.  This would be the spirit in which to do
sadhana:  do it, but don't be attached to any result.  (I find myself doing
sadhana in this spirit.)  ALSO agree on the illusoriness of the intellect.

That brings me to the disagreement about earning Self-Realization through
sadhana.  It's not just about sadhana, but about everything.  I don't think
ANYTHING CAUSES ANYTHING, or that anything gets earned by anything.
Following Krishna in the BG, I see it that the gunas whirl, and that inside
the whirling, the intellect marks out certain areas as things or events and
attributes reality, and cause/effect to them.  But the motion of the gunas
is Consciousness Itself.  And so you can't point to anything inside the
whirl to say that it causes anything else.  Besides that, the intellect is
illusory, so how can someting marked out by it (a cause or an effect) be
taken as real?  Does anything in a movie or a book cause anything else to
happen?  I see it the same way.

This is also the purport of much of the Mandukya Upanishad (sorry can't
quote, book's at home) and the Gaudapada Karika.  If there are no real
things or events in the world, then none of these non-things or non-events
can cause anything.

 Another way to say it is like Nisargadatta Maharaj says:

     "Cause and effect?  Nothing happens unless
     the whole universe makes it happen."

Regards,

--Greg
