Agree about enlightenment not being mental.  But disagree about it being
physical or organic.  If all phenomena, physical, mental, psychic, etheric,
astral, etc. are only appearances in absolute eternal consciousness, then
how can this consciousness itself be reduced to a process in the brain?
This is physical reductionism.  How can that be real?
