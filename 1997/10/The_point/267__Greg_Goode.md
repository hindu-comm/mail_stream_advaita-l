This last sentence, good observation.  Swami Vivekananda has made a
similar point (similar to your paragraph above) many times, that
any surrender, any sadhana, will take you closer to God.  I thought
about that and finally agreed.  Since there's only one thing, since
all there is, is God/Brahman/Consciouness, then any total
introspection or surrender must take you there.  But expecting a
result will hinder you.

(An aside -- I see many of my friends who are seeking caught in a
huge urge, an intense desire to Realize.  Teachers unequivocally
tell them that this desire is standing in their way.)

What does "Jai Ambe" mean?
