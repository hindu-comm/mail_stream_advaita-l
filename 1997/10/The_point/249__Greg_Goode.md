This is my understanding.  There is really no single or joint cause for
anything, the same way that there are no causes or effects in a movie or a
dream.  This is one of the main thrusts of the Gaudapada Karika.

So of course there is no cause for jnaana.  Jnaana is anterior to maya,
phenomenality, the observable world.  So nothing in maya, phenomenality or
the observable world can "cause" or "make" jnaana happen.

I really like this last sentence.  It is Nisargadatta Maharaj's core teaching.
