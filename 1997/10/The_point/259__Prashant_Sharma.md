        What I wanted to say was that "it" has to have a profound
physiological impact at the very basic level. I am not implying (at least
such was not my intention, and I take the opportunity to apologize for
this misstatement) that you can "rewire" the brain and be enlightened.
But what I am saying is that it isnot a mental experience rather
"something else" which has profound physiological impact.
Comments awaited!

Regards,
Prashant.
