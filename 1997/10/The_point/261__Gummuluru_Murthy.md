The I that is used in my statement above [the I that is behind Devadatta,
the king and the soldier of Shri Shankara] is the I that is the substratum
of all. We call that I the king or the soldier or Prashant Sharma or
Gummuluru Murthy. That is the I that is referred in my paragraph.

The I which you defined, as you said, is the one that strengthens the ego,
may be for a later surrender in the sense of bhakti (It is not clear to me
why the ego need to be strengthened for later surrender).

There is a mis-understanding here, of the Viveka ChuDamaNi verses. Shri
Shankara is not comparing Devadatta before and after enlightenment. The
verses and the meanings are as follows:

Sa devadatto"ayam it'iha c'aikatA
viruddha-dharmAmsam apAsya kathyate
yathA tathA tat tvam as'Iti vAkye
viruddha dharmAn ubhayatra hitvA

When we say: "This man is that same Devadatta whom I have previously met,"
we establish a person's identity by disregarding those attributes
superimposed upon him by the circumstances of our former meeting. In just
the same way, when we consider the scriptural teaching "That art Thou" we
must disregard those attributes which have been superimposed upon "That"
and "Thou".

EtAvupAdhI parajeevayostayoh
samyannirAse na paro na jeevah
rAjyam narendrasya bhaTasya kheTakah
tayorapohe na bhaTo na rAjA

Both are one substance. This substance plus maaya and mahat is God, and
the same substance plus the five sheaths is the jeeva. Take away the
upadhis of both, and what is left is the same thing. One man on a throne
is a king. Again, the same man with a shield in hand is a warrior; and
if you take away both the throne and the shield, he is neither the king
nor the warrior.

Thus, there is no place for the process of the mind at all in what I have
written. I admit I should have expanded on this in my earlier post itself.

What I mean is: the substratum for Devadatta, the warrior, the king, you
and I and everyone including the ajnani-turned-jnani is the same
substance - the jnanam.

Thus, the substratum for the person who was called ajnani before and jnani
now (by people who are ajnanis) is the same substance. There is virtually
no change. It is the ajnanis who perceive the change.
