Yes, I did mean that.  Jnaana is not a thing at all.  And in absolute
reality, there are no other things either.

There are several:

1. I AM THAT (huge book, his first, most famous)
2. Prior to Consciousness (Some of the deeper teachings)
3. Consciousness and the Absolute

The very best one, I can't remember the title (book's at home), but maybe
another listmember can recall.  It's compiled from the last teachings he
gave before dying, and is the pithiest, most to-the-point.  If no one else
has posted it over the next several hours, I'll post it tomorrow.
