Although I am not a learned member, let me venture into this analysis.
Yes, there is no path at all, because we are not going anywhere. We are
what we were. No change. It is only the perception by the others (ajnanis)
that changed. As Shri Shankara says in Viveka ChuDamaNi (verses 242,244,
248) it is the same Devadatta. Also, whether we put a soldier garb or a king
garb, the I behind is the same. Thus we are not attaining anything new
in becoming a jnani. It is the same I which is always there. It is the
same jnani.

"At time "t", a man efforting to become a jnani (ajnani:)".  This is in
the intellectual frame of reference attached to this ajnani or another
ajnani.

"At time "t+0", the man is jnani ...".   This is again in the intellectual
frame of reference attached to another ajnani.

In the frame of reference attached to a jnani, there is no ajnani.
Everything is only one thing jnanam.
