Shri Nanda Kumar is moving from the intellectual frame(... For each
person with differing natures.... ) to the Absolute frame(... When one
understands oneself or true nature, one will attain jnanihood....) of
reference and vice versa rather freely in his discussions.

I agree with him that readings of the Bhagavadgita, and the upanishhads
are not really necessary in understanding the true Self (Shri Ram Chandran
may not agree.). They are aids in understanding what we are. Readings of
the scriptures are there to satisfy the intellectual curiosity but the
true nature of the Self is beyond the intellect.

Shri Nanda Kumar says "When one understands oneself or true nature, one
will attain jnanihood.". But, how to understand one's true nature ? We
need a pure mind, divine grace, sAdhana chatushhthaya and much more. If
there is Self-enquiry without proper mental readiness, roaming of the
mind cannot be controlled and the enquiry will lead to nothing. There are
many, many instances of aborted enquiries. Further, as Katha upanishhad
says, the Self has to reveal itself to Itself. However much human effort
with an impure and unready mind will not lead to anything. While the
general statement by Shri Nanda Kumar that we need to understand our true
nature to attain jnanihood is correct, still the path is unknown.
