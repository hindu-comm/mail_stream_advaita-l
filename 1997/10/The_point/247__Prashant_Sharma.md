        Is there a path at all?  One would assume (from a neti-neti
approach) that attainment of *jnaana* is an acausal event in the sense
that no single thing can cause it. Or more precisely:
At time "t" : a man efforting to be a jnani (or ajnani :)
At time "t+0" : the man is  jnaani but now doesnot relate to the previous
state (except through memory...).  So the event is acausal for him.  There
is no center left to which he can relate his being. Unlike his previous
state in which there was the assumed jnani state which served as a center
with respect to which he measured events in his life (as useful or
useless).
I feel that this is probably the sense in which one speaks of the state
of a *jnani* being unrelated to efforts to attain it.  This is also why
people invoke the idea of Grace being a "cause" that can lead to this
state of being.
I hope that the learned list members would point out the flaws in this
analysis.
Regards.
Prashant.
