Namaste,

I read this last night on the first page of Trevor Leggett's preface
to his book "Realization of the Supreme Self" ( which includes at least
some of Sankara's commentary to the Bhagavad Gita ).

"It is easy, and it is not easy. It is easy because the supreme Self is
already there. In the depths, beyond local thinking and feeling, beyond the
potentialities of local thinking and feeling, there is something calm,
immortal and ultimately cosmic. That consciousness is called the Supreme
Self. It is easy to realize because it is merely a question of getting
through unreal obstacles.

It is difficult because these obstacles are felt to be one's very self."


-Allan Curry
