People often say, in response to the possibility of the non-reality of free
will, "Why get out of bed?"  I think that tells us how exhausting life has
been as an individuated agent self.  By all means, tell your friend to get
a rest.  Then let her see what happens.  The phone rings, the bladder gets
full, she smells coffee brewing, she notices a fresh snowfall outside the
window....
