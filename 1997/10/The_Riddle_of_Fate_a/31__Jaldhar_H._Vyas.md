I have the Sanskrit version of this work with the commentary
Rasabhivyanjika of Swayamprakash Yati which was  republished  in 1992 by
Sampurnanand Sanskrit university in Kashi.  There is also a Victorian
English translation in this edition which I didn't find particularly
useful.  In the foreword (also in English by Dr. Mishra the
vice-chancellor of the University, it says Lakshmidhar must have lived in
the 14th century as he is quoted by Swami Brahmanada Bharati in his
commentary on the Vakyasudha.

It is very good.  Especially if you also read the commentary.  However
this edition has 28 shlokas.

His other two works listed are Bhagavannama Kaumudi (commentary on Vishnu
Sahasranama?) and Amrtatarangini commentary on Bhagavata Purana.  I don't
think they've been published yet.
