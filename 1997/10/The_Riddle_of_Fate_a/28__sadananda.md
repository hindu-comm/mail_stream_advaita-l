Sorry, the second quote is the from Shakara's Brahmaavali - meditation
slokas.

The above sentences are verbatim of my own understanding from advaita
books.  Sorry if it projects as quote from an authoritative book.

Advaita Makaranda is by Sri Lakshmidhara Kavi who hails from Orissa and of
17th century and very little is known about him.

The text of 17 or 18 slokas is highly contemplative, logical and
intellectually stimulating.  Those who are looking for logical answers
should read this text.

Swami Tejomayananda, the current head of Chinmaya Mission, has written word
by word meaning and English commentary  on it and the book can be obtained
from the Chinmaya Publications west.

Lakshmidhara kavi has written another book and Swamiji is still searching
for a copy of it.  If any one finds it let us know its whereabouts.

Hari Om!
