Cannot be found upon examination.  I'd agree that the talking happens,
but it is *attributed* to the individual *I*.  The attribution just happens,
and upon reflection, an *I* arises to take credit.  Any version of this *I*
is nothing other than a thought with a supposed object (but that object
is itself another thought).  This thought arises frequently under many
different guises.  Commonality and identity are attributed to these thoughts,
which gives the illusion of continuity, of a persistent entity.  Notice
that this phrasing is all in the impersonal, since that's how (*I* think)
it happens.

Very good point.  Yes, even this very debate.  Nothing special about it, even
though it has inner layers of self-reference.  That's OK, even the seeing of
these layers is an automatic response.

I'd say that even cases of awakening, of the seeing of the world as Brahman,
are all automatic responses.  A personal do-er seemed to exist, and then
*poof!* that do-er ceased to exist.  The layers of superimposition covering
the Atman-which-is-Brahman disappeared in the case of that body/mind
mechanism.

Well, OK, let's speak as if materiality really were the basis for the impulse.
Then on one hand, you can say that there is no choice at all, because
materiality
doesn't choose (therefore, no free will).  On the other hand you could say
that even if you DO speak in terms of a choice, it lacks the essential element
of free will -- the freedom.  I used to believe in this freedom of the
personal
do-er.  An essential component to this freedom is that even when all the
physical, statistical and external cirmcumstances are piled up, you can STILL
choose either (a) or (b).  But if the mind/ego JUST IS the brain and nothing
but the brain (as some Western philosophers hold), then this freedom cannot
exist.  Therefore, no free will.

I myself do believe that the jnani has freedom, the Absolute freedom of
Brahman.
The freedom of spontaneity in actions, unconditioned by ego.  But it's not the
freedom of any kind of will.  Will pertains to a personal do-er, and in the
case
of a jnani, there is no such thing as a do-er.
