Cannot be found where? The entity that is talking of free will or of fate
is the individual *I*, however falsely constructed. That the "I" is
falsely constructed does not make an iota of difference to that "I" so
long as the error persists.

Then the debate about free will and fate is also an automatic response by
the body/mind mechanism, no?

Okay, let us put down the arising of the impulse to a biochemical reaction
in the brain, governed totally by the statistical laws of probability.
Then, there is still a material basis for the impulse and the thing that
chooses this impulse. In a purely logical argument, why should one deny
this material basis?

inconclusive, if inadmissible is too strong a word.
