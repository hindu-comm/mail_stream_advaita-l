The foundation of  the castle is the belief in the ultimate reality of a
jiva self.  The foundation of that belief is a belief in free will.  A
belief in fate only becomes part of the castle if it is itself such a
foundation or rests upon it.  There is no evidence to support free will.
There is evidence, such as precognition, to support fate.  But such
evidence, in the form it comes, upends all notions of linear time, so
whatever notion of self you are left with after meditating on the
non-reality of free will--and all true meditation has that as a result if
not a goal--will not be revived by a belief in fate.  Rather it will be one
step closer to the realization of the one changeless reality that always
was is and will be now.
