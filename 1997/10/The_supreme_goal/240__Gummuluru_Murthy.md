Namaste.

The particular "challenge" posed by Allan Curry brings the early
statements of the Br^hadAraNyaka upanishhad to mind. King Janaka
in his court asks the assembled scholars and r^shis "If any of you
think that you have the perfect knowledge of the Self, you can claim
the prize [1000 cows with gold rings attached to each cow]". YAjnavalkya,
the famous r^shhi of the upanishhads asks one of his disciples to drive
the cows home implying that he (YAjnavalkya) has the perfect knowledge
of the Self. The discussions and the challenges that ensued, led by the
famous lady scholar GArgi forms the text of this major upanishhad.

I do not think there are any modern YAjnavalkyas. I would interpret
Allan's question, not as a challenge to the List members, but in this way:
We are all jnanis, except we are covered by different thicknesses of
layers of avidya. As each layer of avidya gets removed (by sAdhana through
divine grace), our Self shines through. I would take Allan's question as
who thinks that his/her layer of avidya cover is thin enough that the Self
shines through. If the individual has a thought that binds the thought to
that shape, then there is still avidya. Thus, no one can claim that I,
presently bound by this body am the enlightened one [I bow before
YAjnavalkya who made such a claim without attributing that claim to that
particular shape of his in contrast to the other assembled scholars].
