I think Shri Nanda Kumar raised a very pertinent question. However, I
wonder if anyone knows how to attain jnanihood. As far as I know, there
are only the divine grace and purification of the mind (which is also a
result of divine grace) are the two prerequisites. Beyond that, there is
nothing, absolutely nothing which anyone can do to attain jnanihood. Until
then, we have to keep on asking and answering these questions. There is no
other way.

Also, I think that asking and answering these questions is part of the
purification process of the mind.
