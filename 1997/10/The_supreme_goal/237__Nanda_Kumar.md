Regarding so many questions on whether realization is an experience or
not, whether any bodily harm or mental harm will affect a realized
person, whether a jnani will be afraid, whether there's a Brahman or not
at the end of the process etc

I'm reminded of an event connected with Ramana Maharishi :
A visitor asked Ramana whether one could wield occult powers after
attaining jnanihood to which Ramana replied, "Attain jnanihood first"!
