Yes, and it's not exclusively unique to Tibetan Buddhists (such as
Djwal Khul); it's basically one of the most formidable features
integral to maya, regarded as such by Buddhists in general.  At
least it could be considered formidable to the sadhaka in the final
stages of the dissolution of ego-Mind.  In the earlier stages, the
veiling aspect (avarana) is the most disabling, followed by the
projection aspect (vikshepa)--of which glamour factors in as the
last and, in some ways, the most stubborn obstacle.

Namaste.
