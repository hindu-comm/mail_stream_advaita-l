There is no exposition, no beginning or ending.
There is no oversimplyfying.
There are no comments.

Hello Miguel:
        When we free our Self from the "World of Notions, " we will be at REST!
This is absolutely true. Though, it is not oversimplifying but it
doesn't give any direction or clue! If I were the King, I could rule the
Kingdom is logical, correct but such statement is useless! This is a
tautology which repeats a trivial TRUTH!
        The key question that we are investigating is "What is the human
Dharma?" Again Dharma in Sanskrit has multiple meanings and connotations
that are subject to context and the Subject of reference. Some examples
are necessary.  The Dharma of the FIRE is to Burn.  The Dharma of a
Tiger is to kill and eat some cattle. The Dharma of a flower plant is to
bloom! The Dharma of a fruit tree is to yield fruits! The Dharma of the
CREATOR is to CREATE.   Now when we try to define the Dharma of a human
being, we get millions of choices! Religion becomes a helpful tool to
understand the fundamental question on the Human Dharma.  Different
religions have attempted to define the role of human beings in the
universe and the relationship between human beings, between human and
the Creator and between human, the living and nonliving species.  One of
the significant religious movement comes from the "Vedic Tradition." The
people who observed those traditions have evolved the philosophy known
as "Vedanta."  Advaita, Dwaita and VishishtAdvaita are the three major
classifications of Vedanta philosophy.  According to Advaita, Brahman is
the single indivisible entity of the universe and all divisions are the
illusions projected by the Illusory human mind!  The great philosopher
and spiritual master Sankara developed the Advaita philosophy.  Sankara
has developed supporting documents from Vedic Scriptures to validate his
thesis. To understand the genesis of his thesis, it is important to read
his commentaries on the Upanishads, Brahma Sutra and the Bhagavad Gita.
It is also important to understand the historical significance and
relevance of Advaita Philosophy in India during Sankara's time.  For all
relevant information, I request you to refer to the Home page of our
fellow member of the Advaita family, Vidyasankar Sundaresan,
http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~vidya/advaita/.  Vidya has given elaborate
account of the different issues that are relevant for a good
understanding of Advaita. Due to time constraints, let me stop right
here!

        We Advaitins know that Shankar is very logical because we have great
FAITH in Shankar! But for those who do not have such faith, this may not
necessarily be true!  Both Knowledge and Ignorance have no beginning!
This is similar to the famous chicken and egg problem! Since logic is
not going to help to solve this problem, it doesn't matter whether
Shankar is logical or not!

The Upanishads say that the more we know, the more we don't know! The
Upanishads rightly declare that knowledge has no limits! The implication
is that we are always going to be ignorant!  Your example about
chemistry also implies that the knowledge about chemistry seeds
ignorance and mind looks for more knowledge!

Sadaji:
What is logically perfect? Ramanujacharyar  and Madhwacharyar only
questions the assumptions of the model.  Your explanation just says that
the logic will become perfect only with the assumption! The visions of
Sankaracharyar, Ramanujacharyar and Madhwacharyar are different and
accordingly they have different explanations to the TRUTH.  Acceptance
of either of these visions subject to individual FAITH and  belief.

Sadaji:
What is the definition of Better Answer? TRUTH is mystic and can't be
explained by the human intellect.  As long as the intellect is intact,
the questions will remain unanswered.  There can be no answers and
consequently there are no better or worse answers! For believers of one
FAITH, other answers become vague and this is the TRUTH!
