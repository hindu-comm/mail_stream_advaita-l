Yes, scripturally that is true.  But the ego was not sadananda or Greg, but
more
like a subset or component of sadananda or Greg.  So the last person who had
that ego was a different person.

I think we are really talking about two different subjects and don't really
disagree.  I was focussing on what it is to be a person.  You were talking
about the mechanics of reincarnation according to Vedanta.  I think we agree
that the person doesn't reincarnate.

I like what Ramana says, that reincarnation is only true for those who think
that one of the shareeras is who they are.  But in reality, there is no birth,
death, or reincarnation.

Again, I agree that this is scriptural, but in other places, like in Drig
Drishya
Vivek, Shankara says that the subtle body is insentient.  So ultimately,
the ego
is not what identifies with anything, because it doesn't do anything.

Thanks for this explanation.
