Let me chime in with a recommendation for "Self-Unfoldment."  It is
a small book of well-written, well-organized, lucidly explained
Vedanta concepts.

Where is Swami Chinyayanandaji located?

There's another explanation I've seen for the beginningless of ignorance.
It's from Swami Vireswarananda.  In addition to being beginningless in
TIME, ignorance is logically beginningless.  Ignorance is due to
superimposition.  Any mentation is something superimposed.  But what
is it superimposed on?  What is the substratum?  Brahman.  But the
substratum is not nirguna Brahman.  When thought turns to what the
substratum is, we see that the substratum is an object.  Therefore
the substratum itself is also a superimposition, which means it is
superimposed on a previous substratum, which is the result of an even
previous superimposition, ad infinitum.  Thus, because the substratum
is never Brahman-without-uphadis, superimposition (therefore ignorance)
is beginningless.

Here comes some unorthodox argumentation.  This Christian answer you
pointed to above is no worse than the answer given by reincarnation.
The vasanas and sanchita karma we inherit at birth are not from our
own previous life.  They are from another person's life, one of our
predecessors.  Therefore, we are "paying for" or experiencing the
result of another person's sins.  Just like another person in the
future will pay for our sins.  Helps you see humanity as one.

Even if it WERE the same person's previous life, the person is so
unknown to us that it still comes to the same thing.  To be told that
it's your previous life, that your own actions in that life are what
now cause you to receive (e.g.) torture, abuse and suffering in this
life -- this adds insult to injury.
