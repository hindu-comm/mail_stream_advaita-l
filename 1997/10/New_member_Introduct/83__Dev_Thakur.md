Thank you for your welcome to the advaitam list
kindly do add me to the list

by way of introduction- i am a doctoral student working on strategic
management of innovation risk in the pharmaceutical industry; my
interest in advaitam is as a beginner with no scholarly / philosophical
expertise...however, it is part of my heritage and i feel my work and
life could benefit from this association.

I agree to abide by the rules and traditions of the list

Many Thanks and Regards
