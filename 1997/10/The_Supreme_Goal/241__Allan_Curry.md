    Exactly right. I too bow to THAT which is not covered by
    any layer of avidya whatsoever. I was not saying that
    anyone has *claimed* to be Brahman without any avidya,
    but they may have *implied* as much and some of us may
    have believed them. I am not a perfectly realized being
    so I am unable to assess the realization of others with
    certainty. That is why I asked such egoless incarnations
    of the Divine to announce themselves, if indeed there
    are any on this list. I wasn't "seeking an easy answer"
    to the question "how to attain jnanihood". I wanted to
    clear the air of any intentional or accidental
    misunderstandings as to the source of comments appearing
    on Advaita-L. In the abscence of such self scrutiny, our
    subject matter can easily lend itself to very serious
    cases of mistaken identities with potentially dire
    consequences, IMO.

    The Upanishads may not accept anyone's claim to be a
    jnani unless perhaps one *is* a jnani as in the case of
    YAjnavalkya. So if any of you are as enlightened as
    Ramana Maharshi or Krisha or YAjnavalkya please say so.
    If you do not, then I suggest the rest of us interpret
    your silence as an honest admission that you are *not*
    the equal of these truly realized beings and we
    therefore consider your respective opinions accordingly.

regards,

- Allan Curry

Namaskar:

        The messages in the scriptures (that includes the Upanishads and Gita)
are subtle.  I do not remember that I have stated that reading of the
scriptures are essential for self-realization. Scriptures are not for
recreational reading material for appreciating the beauty of the
sayings! The most important part is to practice what is being said in
the scriptures.  Gita is not for reading pleasure but only for
undertaking implied spiritual life. This possible only with great faith,
dedication and with an attitude of total surrender!  The Hindu
scriptures do not propogate "Do nothing attitude!"  Realization is not
something poured from heaven like a rain fall. One has to earn it
through Sadhana! We can not change our attitude instantaneously and it
takes time and efforts! The journey of self-realization is a
long-journey without any known path. However, the scriptures are
valuable guides which can help not fall into traps of dead-end streets!
