I am not sure about the implications contained in the above
statement.

In anycase, regarding your computer screen, it is recognized clearly
as an object by the ego. However, the ego cannot obviously perceive
itself as an object. It is an object to the "subject" you mention,
and when you realize that you are the "subject", gItA tells us that
ego/desire/aversion etc will fall off like objects. There is
clearly a hierarchy here. So your "already be free of them" is not
right when one identifies oneself with the ego.
