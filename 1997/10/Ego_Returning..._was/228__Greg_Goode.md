Just last night I was thinking of another way to think
about the unimportance of the ego.  The arising of the Greg
Goode ego is no more a part of who I really am than the
arising of someone ELSE'S ego.  Greg's body/mind/ego has
no more to do with Greg's real *I* than the man-in-the-street's
body/mind/ego.

Then, lo and behold, this morning I was reading the
ASHTAVAKRA GITA, Chapter III, and I see this very apropriate
verse:

     "The Mahatma regards the actions of his body
     as not different from those of another body.
     Whether praised or blamed, he abides in the
     Self, undisturbed."

                AG 3.10
