Precisely! It has always been the case. But suppose that I
sit always in front of the screen and insist that I am that
screen. That is the case of false identification (like the body,
mind ..etc). No matter what the object of identification is,
the moment identification takes place, the subject gets bound.
But its no big deal, as soon as the identification ceases all
that remains is the subject :-)

Srinivas Sista.
