        Psychological fear requires an entity to which the fear belongs. For a
jnani there is no such entity.  There is just the body functioning
unhindered by thought. The body shall react to the surroundings but
spontaneously, without "fear" (which has an element of time in it). There
shall be pain, and all other "normal" behaviour, but no "planning" to
escape from it. I feel that for a jnani the senses act independently, they
dont connive to create the personal entity. But it is impossible to imagine
exactly how  the jnani would "work"l.  In the above analysis I have used
the "neti neti" approach.
Regards.
Prashant.
