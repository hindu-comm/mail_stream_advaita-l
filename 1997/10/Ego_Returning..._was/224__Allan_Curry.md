The important point above seems to be that the ego is as
much an object as any other, would that misrepresent your
point?

I remember reading recently in the Bhagavad Gita that
desire and aversion were also objects (the "field") and
not really part of the subject (the knower of the field).
If the ego and desire/aversion are both objects then
they have no more to do with me than this computer
screen and I would already be free of them, is that right?
