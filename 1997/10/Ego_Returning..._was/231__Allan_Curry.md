    I agree that pain is not the issue but in my opinion
    fear proves that an ego still lives. It's my belief that
    an enlightened being (non-person, whatever) just is not
    capable of being afraid. They could mimic the outward
    symptoms of being afraid just for a joke but they are
    actually incapable of fear. Would you agree?

    I have no doubt that Ramana Maharshi was enlightened and
    that there was no personal self there. I can't say as much
    however for most other so called gurus out there. How about
    list members?  Any of us incapable of being afraid? Any of
    us think we can be enlightened and still be afraid from
    time to time?
