Good example from the Gita.  Very apropos, Gita 13.1,
body and manifestation are the field, and in all fields
the Lord is the knower of the field.

The ego and desire/aversion are there and are all part
of the field, just like the body, dreams, clothes, car,
etc.  The Lord doesn't identify with the field and say
He is it, or that it is He.  The Lord has created the field, and
attachment to any part of the field is itself part of the field.
Be the knower.

That chapter goes on to name desire, aversion, pleasure, pain,
birth, death, old age and disease as part of the field, and exhorts
dispassion and non-attachment with respect to the field, as well
as devotion to the Lord.

You are the knower.  The knower is the Lord.  You are the Lord.

This is why Nisargadatta recommends reading the Gita from the
viewpoint of Krishna, because that is what is true, even though we
might not know it.
