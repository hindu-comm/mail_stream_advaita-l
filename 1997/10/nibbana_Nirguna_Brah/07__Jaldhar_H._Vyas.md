Well bear in mind it is not a criticism of _him_ (there are other examples
of that) but a criticism of Buddhism.  By the time of Shankaracharya there
had been at least a thousand years of development of Buddhist thought and
there were many different schools all claiming to represent their masters
true teaching.  Partly the problem is as the passage you quote suggests,
the Buddha was not a systematic philosopher in either the Indian or the
Western sense.

Vedantins and Mimamsaks believe the Vedas are eternal and uncreated.

The mistake is in assuming the Vedas are discussing "little subjects" in
the first place.  The karma kanda of the Vedas discusses Dharma and Dharma
alone.  Dharma consists of actions.  Accordingly the Mimamsakas divide it
into Vidhis (injunctions), nishedhas (prohibitions) and arthavada
(everything else.)  this arthavada has a legitimate place in the Vedas
because it is there to explain the or urge the performance or
non-performance of actions.  For instance the Purusha sukta which Anand
mentioned is there to extol the virtue of the sacrifice called
Purushamedha.  That it also describes the creation of the universe is an
incidental detail.  Similiarly the Jnana kanda of the Vedas describes
Brahman.  Any other information it may give on the way is incidental.

Let me give an example.  You are no doubt familiar with algebra problems
from school that went along the lines of "If a train is heading west from
Clevelend at 50 mph and a train is heading east from San Francisco at 60
miles an hour when do they meet?" You need the information to solve the
problem but does it affect the method in any way to know there is no train
line between Cleveland and San Francisco or trains travel at different
speeds in real life?
