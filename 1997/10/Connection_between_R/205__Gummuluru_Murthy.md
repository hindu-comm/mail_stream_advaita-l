Thanks very much for the elucudation and for confirming my thoughts on
this. I would need some further clarification on the topic.

I do not see the humans *experiencing* the Absolute. They can become
(or realize that they are) the Absolute, but it is not an experience. Or
am I just pre-occupied with semantics ?

Then, what happens in the samAdhi ? Is it an experience or is it being the
Absolute ?

Taking the water-bubble analogy, from the bubble's perspective, can the
bubble experience being water ? Bubble is always water, whether bubble
knows it or not. But, it cannot *experience* being water. Similarly, the
human is always Absolute, whether he/she knows it or not. He/she cannot
have brief occasional *experiences* of the Absolute.

Now, if we take the analogy of the child: we can say to the child, you are
a big boy now, and over a period of time, he feels like being a big boy.
That, again, is not an experience.

Further, when we say the "human experiences the Absolute or the Reality",
we are using the Absolute as an object, which cannot be the case. Absolute
has to be the subject. Hence, again, we cannot say that the humans
*experience* Reality.

I would be grateful if knowledgeable members clarify my concepts on this
matter.
