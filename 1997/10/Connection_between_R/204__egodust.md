Concur.

Here's an excerpt from a recent reply to a question re this idea:

There is no realization for the jiva.  That's why there is, per se, no
such thing as a jnani.  The jnani isn't a person.  A burnt rope is *not*
a rope, it only looks to be one.  The ego or jiva is only capable of
unrealization; or the realization that it itself *can't realize*.  This
is what's meant by the surrender or destruction of ego-Mind.  So that, if
we can discover that our perception being charged with the names and forms
of maya is not to be somehow switched to some rarefied conceptual/experiential
idea of the names and forms, *as such*, of brahman (which don't exist),
we'll abandon our rigid pre-set notions of concrete hands-on bliss.
This is why psychic and psychedelic experiences, although harbingers on
the path, don't themselves confer samadhi.
