Then what would you suggest it is?

Btw. looking at the nearest Sanskrit dictionary (V.S. Apte's) gives the
following definitions.

1.  Blown out or put out, extinguished (as a lamp or fire)  Examples of
this usage are given from Veni Samhara and Kumara Sambhava.

2.  Lost, disappeared.

3.  Dead, deceased.

4.  Liberated from existence.

5.  Set (as the Sun)

6.  Calmed, quieted.

7.  Plunged.
