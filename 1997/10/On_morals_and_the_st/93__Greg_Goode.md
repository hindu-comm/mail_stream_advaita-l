It was I who posted that.  This emphasis on purifying the mind is something
the Ramakrishna Mission takes very seriously.  I asked one swami something
about non-duality vs. duality.  He replied, "Duality, non-duality!  It
doesn't matter.  One must first purify the mind!"

Another swami had American attendees who were interested in Raja and Jnana
Yoga.  The latter especially, because the swamis do talk a lot about it.
But the attendees were repeatedly told to first purify the mind by devotion
and selfless action.

I agree with your experience in reading the Vivekachoodamani.  Some of the
things exhorted seem to be the RESULTS of enlightenment rather than the
steps to it.  Also agree that one's heart must be in it entirely!
