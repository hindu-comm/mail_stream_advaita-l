Namaste!

In Swami Krishnanandaji Maharaj's lecture on dreaming and waking, he has
given another way to look at self-control.  Swamiji says that one should
place oneself strongly with an intense form of imagination that one is
dreaming this world (so as to wake up to the fact that Brahma Satyam Jagat
Mithya, Jeevo Brahmaiva Na Aparah - Brahman alone is real, this world is
unreal; the Jiva is identical with Brahman).  Since the dreaming is
possible only when the sense organs of dream also are active, they ought
to be withdrawn in order to "Wake Up".  Hence sense abstraction
(pratyahara) becomes the precondition for the other type of concentration
on the higher level of consciousness in meditation.  In fact Swamiji says
that 90% of our "work" is done if we can successfully withdraw the senses
from the objects.

Hari Om Tat Sat!
