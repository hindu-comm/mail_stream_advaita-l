Namaste,

Dear friends,

I am considering purchasing some or all of the six volume "Samkara Source
Book" published by Shanti Sadan. I was wondering if any of you had opinions
about the quality of this work? Is it a good or bad representation of
Sankara's thought?

Copies I've seen recently had the unmistakable smell of mildew (which might
definitely exclude them from my library!). Were these copies an unfortunate
exception or more like the rule for Shanti Sadan publications?

sincerely,

Allan Curry
