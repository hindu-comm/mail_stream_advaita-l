To me it seems very good.  I have Vols. I and II, on the Absolute, and on
Creation.
They have a pretty good reputation.

The copies I've seen are brand-new, smell nice.  I think you can get them from
SAT in California.  There are other mail-order places I'm sure, which I can
check on.  I know Watkins Bookshop in London usually has the whole set in
stock.
