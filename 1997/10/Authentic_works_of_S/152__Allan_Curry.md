Namaste,

I bet you've already discussed this several times, but I must have missed it...

Which works attributed to Samkara are considered to be authentic?  Alston
says Viveka Cudamani, Atma Bodha, Svatmanirupana, Aparoksanubhuti and Sata
Sloki were *not* written by Sankara. That leaves only the Upadesa Sahasri
and commentaries to the Upanishads and Gita. Is that correct?

Is Alston right about this? If so, do the works attributed to Samkara by
later authors contain any significant differences from Samkara's thought?
