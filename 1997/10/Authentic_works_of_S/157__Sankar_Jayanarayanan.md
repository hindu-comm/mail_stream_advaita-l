This is the opinion of historians regarding Shankara's works:

Shankara = Author of the Brahma Sutra Bhashya that is attributed to Shankara.

Any work that deviates from this work in either style or opinion is considered
spurious. This is the yardstick to judge if a work is an authentic work of
Shankara, according to Richard King. You can consult his book "Early advaita
Vedanta and Buddhism."

As per this view, all the commentaries on the Upanishads excluding the
Shvetashvatara U., the commentary on the Gita, the Upadeshasahasri, the
commentary on Vyasa's commentary on Patanjali's Yoga Sutras are all genuine.

The reason Vivekachudamani is considered spurious is interesting.
I had posted the following a while ago on the newsgroup soc.religion.hindu.
Ramakrishnan's reply to my posting also follows:

I find the view among western scholars, that the suutra bhaashyaa is some kind
of totem pole around which every other work of our aachaarya should execute a
dance, quite laughable. It shows their ignorance of both our advaitic and the
Indian mentality. Different things are taught to aspirants of various grades!
This concept is very simple. So there is no problem with shaMkara being a
shR^ishTi dR^ishTi vaadin in the suutra bhaasshya and an ajaata vaadi in the
upadeshasaahasrii and the kaarikaa bhaashhya. These people better learn such
simple concepts before writing our history.
----------------------------------------

There are similar reasons for rejecting some other works attributed to Shankara.
The famous "Saundarya Lahari" is one such, since the author/poet refers to an
object invented only after Shankara's time (800 AD)!

Some others like the GauDapaadiiya KArikA Bhaashhya have not yet been
satisfactorily classified as authentic or spurious.
