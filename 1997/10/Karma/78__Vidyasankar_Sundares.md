Deutsch's reconstruction of advaita is quite different from how advaita
authors themselves treat karma. In standard advaita thought, the "means of
valid knowledge" include Sruti (again, here come the vedas), which inform
you of karma. Moreover, an postulation (arthApatti - another standard
means of knowledge) supported by an inferential argument (anumAna) will
also suffice, to take you from the universe with its variety to karma.

Not necessarily. You need one diamond to cut another. The paths taught
have a pedagogical value, which does not compromise the description of
the ultimate reality. You teach a three-year old kid about the commonly
used numerical system, and you don't talk about formal axiomatic theory at
that level. You teach a ten-year old kid that atoms are indestructible,
and at a later stage you negate that earlier teaching, by informing him
about protons, neutrons and electrons. Thus, you peel away the layers
stage by stage. A very similar approach is taken in advaita vedAnta, and
this applies to Buddhist teaching too.
