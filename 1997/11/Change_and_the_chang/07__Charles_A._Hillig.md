Hi, Gummuluru,

     But isn't that just another strategy?     Are you suggesting that I
"change" from what I am doing to start focusing in on my "changelessness?"

     If I do that, I've already defeated myself by changing from "I CAN
change" into "I can NOT change."

     Since it's just another position,  the question still remains:  "WHO
is the "holder" of this position concerning change?"

     We are changeless because "we" are not really "here" at all.

      Never have been,  Never will be.

     Only the Self is present.



                              With Blessings,

                                   Chuck Hillig

Namaskar:
      I not only agree with your statement but I want say that no one
can ever disagree that Undconditional Love will remove all fears! The
Hindu concept of Bhakti implies total to love to all living and
non-living beings! Total love to God who is omnipotent, omnipresent and
eternal necessarily means that there can be no enemies and evil
qualities. The unconditional love is known as Divine Love which is the
result of negating Ahamkara or selfishness and is therefore untainted by
any motive. It negates all worldy love in the mind of the devotee
(whether the devotee is a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist or
whatsover). Consequently there is complete self-effacement where the
devotee negates the intellectual self!
   The person who conducts the Karma Yoga can perform the action without
looking for the fruits. Interestingly, Karma Yoga is impossible without
uncoditional or Divine Love for every living and non-living entities of
the Universe. This is Bhakti Yoga.  In Jnana Yoga the SELF-realized
person sees himself (herself) in everyone and he (she) merges with all
living and non-living entities of the Universe. When start any one of
these Yogas, we get the illusion that they are different!  But when we
have the WISDOM, we can see that Bhakti, Karma and Jnana are not only
interrelated but they mean the same!
   An intellectual analysis of self, SELF and Brahman can bring more
insigts.  self is the intellect or ego and SELF is the Atman. Brhaman
the totality according to these assumptions will imply equal to self
plus SELF.
               Brahman = self + SELF
This identity is mathematically valid if and only if self = 0! Unless we
surrender the ego or the intellect, we cann't realize the SELF. As long
as intellect is present, there will be fear. As long as intellect is
present, there will be objections to what I say now! I will face with
fear as long as I work with my self instead of SELF! A flash WISDOM
asks me to stop now and  SHUT UP!

        The questions, Whether I change?, Whether I am a Ajnani? and their
answers arise indicate that I am Ajnani! As long as I am at this
igonorant state, I want to change. If and when the moment comes where I
start believe that I am changeless, I will be changeless! Questions,
changes and answers indicate our desires and sensory perceptions! Until
we negate the questions and answers we are likely believe that we are
Anjanis! Even when we state that we are Jnaniz, we are Anjanis!

Namaskar:

An anlogy can help us to focus our attention.  Suppose I go to New York
to visit the Statute of Liberty. I know that the statue of Liberty
exists somewhere!  It is ofcourse possible to go and visit the Statue of
Liberty without any maps and guidebooks. But I don't dare to do that
venture! Guide books and maps can help me to plan ahead of time about
how I can wisely devote my time in the search of the Statue of Liberty.
Prior information from experts and reviewers can help me to focus on
various important aspects of the Statue of Liberty.
        Scriptures and experiences of Sages can help us greatly to focus our
attention on the right strategy of learning! We don't want to reinvent
the wheel! This does not mean that we have no freedom to say what we
have to say or write! Fortunately, each of us have some strong and week
points and we have the opportunity to contribute and learn! The day we
are born in this world, we are curious to learn and we never find enough
time to learn all by ourselves! So far in our life, we have accepted
text books, training materials and teachers as a media for learning. For
Advaita, bookish knowledge is not sufficient but no one can say, it is
unnecssary!
