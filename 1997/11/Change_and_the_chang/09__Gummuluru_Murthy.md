As Prashant Sharma said in one of his postings, the use of the word "I"
is causing problems.

I see the difficulty in the argument. Let me explain what I try to convey.

The intellectual I is the one that is meditating.
The intellectual I's objective is to be one with the Self I. The Self I is
unchanging. The intellectual I thinks it is changing.
                               ^^^^^^
For the intellectual I to be merged with the Self I, the intellectual I
should shed its upadhis and see no change in itself.

This question can only be answered in the intellectual frame, because in
the Absolute frame, there are no answers or questions. It is very
difficult to answer, but the answer can only be the intellectual I.

Eventually That will be the position, but an alternate way to put it may
be "We are everywhere rather than not really here" (?)
