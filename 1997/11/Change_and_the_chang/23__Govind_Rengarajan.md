        If I may ask, how do you know this? Through scriptures
        or ... ? Hypothetically speaking, if it were possible
        for you to completely erase everything you have learned
        so far from your memory - everything from giitaa to
        upanishads, statements of sages, etc., will you still
        be able to make the above statement?

        Can the intellect truly understand/comprehend the Self? If
        so, the ancient seers who said "neti neti" were clearly
        cheating!
