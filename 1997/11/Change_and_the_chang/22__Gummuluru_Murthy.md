At the risk of being branded arrogant, this intellectual self, variously
called Gummuluru Murthy likes to take up this friendly debate with the
intellectual self Allan Curry and try to answer his following question:

This intellectual self would not put it the way Charles put it, but:

The SELF pervades all, here, there, everywhere, you, me and everyone.
SELF is the rock, the animal, the plant, the human. SELF does not
speak. SELF does not act. But it is the SELF that powers you to speak.
What is spoken is the intellectual self's understanding of the SELF.

Regards
Gummuluru Murthy
