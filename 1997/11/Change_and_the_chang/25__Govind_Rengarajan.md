        The point I was trying to make here is that the "Self"
        should be known without any bias whatsoever to a
        person who is realized. And this knowledge (of Self), I
        *believe* is beyond direct explanation.

        My *concept* of Self is similar to yours which
        I gathered from reading and listening among other things.
        But I do not have any direct experience of it. The reason I
        replied to your earlier mail was to make sure of the
        difference between a direct knowledge of "Self" and an
        understanding of the *concept* of "Self". And to this you
        have replied:

        Thanks. This is what I wanted to know.

        BTW, if the tone of my earlier mail sounded offensive to
        you, I am sorry. It was not meant to be.
