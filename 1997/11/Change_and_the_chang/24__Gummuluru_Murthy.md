I am most surprised at this question. I think the question raised is the
most hypothetical I have ever heard and I cannot see how it can be
answered. We are what we are based on what we were. One cannot erase
everything or anything. To try to figure out what the intellectual self
would be if and if something had happened or not happened is the most
futile exercise.

If my understanding of the SELF is wrong, I would like Shri Rengarajan
to explain to me what his understanding of the SELF is. Does he think,
contrary to what I said, that SELF is confined only to a small space,
only to one individual or to one particular species ? What is his concept
of the SELF, if it is different from what I have given ?

Shri Rengarajan further asks how do I know what the SELF is ?

My answer to the question is: I recognize that the human intellect
cannot comprehend the SELF. But, whatever concepts I have of the
SELF are by sAdhana, by contemplation of the SELF continuously, by
meditation on the SELF and above all by Shri Lalitha's grace.

No, that is why it is put as the intellectual self's understanding of
the SELF. If only the intellectual self can understand and comprehend
the SELF .....
