Upon the application of self-enquiry in regards to this matter--in
my estimation--reveals that the source or ground of this information
is indeterminate and untraceable to any knowable entity, egoic, atmanic
or otherwise.

The following is a disclaimer on my website, to this end:

All the writings herein by "egodust"--as implied by the name--are not
traceable to any individual that can be identified as being their
author...and the apparent identity of "egodust" is, alongside the
information disseminated on this website, irrelevant...especially in light
of the fact that such information shared is, in his own view, unnecessary.
Furthermore, "egodust" claims that the process by which this is happening
is incomprehensible to him; and that the merits of whether or not it
[the alleged metaphysical knowledge] is reflective of, or pointing toward,
'the truth' is left solely for the reader to determine.

Namaste.
