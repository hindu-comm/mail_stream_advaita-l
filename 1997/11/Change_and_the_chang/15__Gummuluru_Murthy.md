Namaste.

I agree fully with the above. You have put it as well as it can be put
(the first two paragraphs). I would be grateful for a further elabaration
of paragraph 3. I did not understand the concept of apparent ego.

I think that one has to raise above the maaya and above the thought that
the jeeva is bound. Then only, the jeeva will be out of the so-called
shackles. In reality, there are no shackles. It is only the shackles
created by the jeeva's own thought. The jeeva (or the core of what is
jeeva) is ever free.

Coming back to the change and the Changeless, where is the change in I ?
The changes in the body, changes in the thoughts, changes in the intellect
(hence the concept of jnani and ajnani) are only the superficial changes,
not to the core I. The core I is eternal, unchanging, nishchala and
nirmala.

In Katha upanishhad verse I.3.14, Lord Yama, in explaining the knowledge
of the Self to young Nachiketa, implores

UttisThata jAgrata prApya varAn nibodhata
kshurasya dhArA niShitA duratyayA
durgam pathastat kavayo vadanti

Arise! Awake! having attained your boons (from the treachers), understand
them; Sharp as the edge of a razor and hard to cross, the path is
difficult to tread, so say the sages.

Shri Shankara comments on this verse

... atah taddarshanArtham anAdyavidyAprasuptA uttisThata, he jantavah,
AtmjnAnAbhimukhA bhavata; jAgrata, ajnAnanidrAyA ghorarupAyA
sarvAnarthabIjabhUtAyAh, kshayam kuruta ...

Therefore, in order to realize THAT, Arise! O creatures, immersed in
the sleep of beginningless ignorance; may you turn in the direction of
the knowledge of the Self ! Awake from this sleep of unknowing, which
is terrible and the seed of all troubles. Destroy it!...
