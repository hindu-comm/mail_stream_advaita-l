Namaste.

While the screen and the characters in the movie is a good analogy, I am
not entirely sure it fits the advaitic thinking fully.

It does not allow the jeeva [in this analogy, the characters in the
movie] to merge with the Absolute [in this analogy, the screen]. It
stresses the non-reality of the jeeva. But it does not show the
fundamental precis of the advaita that the jeeva without upAdhis is
the Brahman. How could that be accommodated in the screen and movie
character analogy ?  Yet, I see this analogy being used effectively
by Nisargadatta and others.
