    Is the author of the above the atman who can say
    "The entire world of egos is part of who I am..." or is
    the author of the above one of the egos the atman is
    speaking about?  If the author is atman, does the author
    also have certain knowledge of this fact?  If the author
    is not atman, how does he know what atman can or cannot say?
