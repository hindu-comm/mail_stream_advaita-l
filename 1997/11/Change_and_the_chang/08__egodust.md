Concur.  Tripura Rahasya (ch 18, v.124): "The strongest fetter is
the certainty that one is bound."

What thwarts us--being immersed in what we believe is avidya--
is that we couldn't possibly be enlightened in light of the
heavy misery and darkness abounding our weary-struck souls.
Nevertheless, if we could but realize that even after the advent
of so-called moksha, the jivanmukta still acts out his/her unique
prarabdha, which may or may not exhibit ignorant behavior [via
thoughts, words, deeds].  The critical difference is that the
jnani no longer meaningfully identifies with such behavior.
That is, although the behavior remains a recognizable facet
within the totality of Self, it no longer functions as a dynamic
through which he exclusively identifies.  A good analogy is the
color spectrum, where the influx of all colors (representing
here all thoughts, beings, events) yields the white-out samadhi.

So that, moksha is founded on the certainty that one cannot be
defined/confined by ego.  In fact, one's apparent ego has as much
to do with one's Self as does any other ego.  The atman can say:
"The entire world of egos is part of who I am; and yet these
[even collectively] represent such an insignificant part, as to
be substantially irrelevant."  What are the implications of this?

Namaste.
