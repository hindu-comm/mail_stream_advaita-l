     Well, would YOU say that the characters in a movie are, in fact, the

     Actually, isn't the screen itself the only reality?

     Pure, radiant, boundless consciousness
         whose nature is to BE what it is
                 by pretending to "become"
                             what it's pretending to NOT be.
