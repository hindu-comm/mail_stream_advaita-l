This makes a lot of sense.  Bishop George Berkeley, British Idealist
extraordinaire, would agree.  In fact perception does not even manifest
objects such as birds and trees.  It manifests ideas of certain qualities,
e.g., the ideas of shape, color, sound, etc.  Metaphor, inference and
analogy do the rest.  Based on perception alone, one cannot conclude
anything about the existence of external objects.
