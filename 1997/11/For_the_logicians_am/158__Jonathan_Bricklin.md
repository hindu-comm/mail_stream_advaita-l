Relative non-existence only.  That a horse is not a cow is not an argument
for the existence of nothingness.  In fact, once consciousness becomes
consciousness of objects then the existence of any one given object
*necessitates* rather than negates other objects.  The not-the grass,
not-my-mommy, not-my-car, not-a-horse thing making that funny sound all
make possible the question:  "What is that?"

Perception has, as you say, "nothing to do with non-existence."  It has
only to do with existence or somethingness.   And inference,  for its part,
cannot validate a nothingness since nothingness (as opposed to a
nothingness with borders, such as a hole in paper) is the one thing which,
by definition does not exist.
