Subject: Re: your mail

Mr. Ravi:
Thank your for the msg. Interested in Advaitam and discussions about
advaitam because of its philosophy of non-difference and therefore,
tolerance.  I hope to learn something by joining the discussion
group-Sathsangam.
Thank you.

I request  the list members of advaita-l to save the welcome
files when they subsribe to advaita-l. Often we get queries
for some basic stuff like, how to sign out or how to change the
user options.


For a detailed help (user guide), please refer to
http://www.lsoft.com/manuals/user/user.html

Here few commands which are often used are listed

1) For all these following actions, please send the mail  to
listserv at listserv.tamu.edu
Keep the subject line blank and dont include any other stuff in the
mail like signature.

        a) To unsubscribe from the list

        send mail to listserv with the body of the message containing
        SIGNOFF ADVAITA-L

        b) To check your options

        send mail to listserv with the body of the message containing
        QUERY ADVAITA-L

        c) In case you are going out of town and do not want
        your mail box to be flooded. Send a message
        SET  ADVAITA-L NOMAIL
        after you are back, to get the messages again send a
        message
        SET ADVAITA-L MAIL

        d) In a simiar way you can change options like
        SET ADVAITA-L DIGEST
        or
        SET ADVAITA-L NODIGEST

2) Please dont leave an automatic bot responding in your absence. The
way the list is setup, Reply-to is to LIST, so this will create
flood of mail to all the mail boxes. In fact this happened in amma-l (list
dedicated to discuss the teachings of shriii maata amR^itaanandamayii)
yesterday. In fact I am even thinking of changing the Reply-to to AUTHOR.

3) Archives of advaita-l are located in
http://listserv.tamu.edu/archives/advaita-l.html
It is very easy to search and read the archives here. In case your
netscape connection is slow or you want to print it in weekly archives
you may want to get the archives by sending a mail to listserv
with the body
INDEX ADVAITA-L
It will send you the list for files with filename  and other other details
with this info you can get a particular file. For instance if you want the
the file LOG9711A (for 1st week of november 1997). Send
GET ADVAITA-L LOG9711A

We (govind and I) are willing to do these services for you if you
find any difficulty. Only thing is if you do it on your own, things will
be done much faster.


With respects
Ravi
