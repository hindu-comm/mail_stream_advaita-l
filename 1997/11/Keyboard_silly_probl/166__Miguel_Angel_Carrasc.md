Sorry to bother you with a silly problem, but perhaps someone can easily
put an end to it.
I still do not know how to type some punctuation marks (apostrophes,
quotations, etc) in my Spanish keyboard so that they appear on the list as
I type them here.
Anyone can help?
If so, why not also write a short note about it and in the future send it
to the new members from outside the USA together with the usual Welcome,
Rules, etc?
Thank you.
