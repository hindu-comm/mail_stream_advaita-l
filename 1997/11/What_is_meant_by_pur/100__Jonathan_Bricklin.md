I'm willing to make a leap of faith, but this requires a leap of logic I
can't seem to move on.  How does "consciousness-without-an-object" void of
any
kind of sense data make sense to you?  Consciousness, like desire, can be
contemplated apart from the content of any one given object, and each
moment of consciousness may be a relativized emanation from the one
unchanging consciousness--unchanged, because, as unrelativized, it is at
once all moments that ever were or will be, but what is this *pure*
consciousness you speak of?   A Zen koan?  Like one hand clapping?
