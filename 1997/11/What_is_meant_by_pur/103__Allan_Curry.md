    But your "unchanging consciousness" is *my* Shiva! :-)

    When you talk about the non-existence of free-will in
    the face of "the sum total of everything that ever was,
    is or will be", I always hear "surrender to God". But by
    any name, I feel we are all very blessed to even suspect
    we are being drawn into its orbit.

Om Namah Shivaya
