Recently, on asking a Swami whether holding on to the 'I' feeling or the
Self, is  the highest level of practice, he questioned me as to how I knew
if the perceived Self was not the mind itself.

With the idea of distinguishing the Self from the mind, I came across
several passages in C Rajagopalochari's book on the Upanishads and
Talks with Ramana ..., that lays great emphais on the pure mind and in
some cases even equating the pure mind to the Self.

So I've lately started having doubts whether in their infinite wisdom, the
Rishis actually introduced the concept of the Self as a seperate entity
from the mind, to add greater lure to the process for the aspirants or to
give it a seperate identity or for whatever reason. Can someone clarify?
