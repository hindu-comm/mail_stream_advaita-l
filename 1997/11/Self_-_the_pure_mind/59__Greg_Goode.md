It can't really be the Mind -- the Self is supposed to be there in waking,
sleep, and dreams, but the mind is not.  And the Mind is nothing more than
thoughts/feelings/appearances.

I haven't read Rajagopalochari's book on the Upanishads, but I'd venture to
say that the "pure mind" is an introduction for teaching purposes,
something more tangible than the Self.  Lots of teachers say to purify the
mind.  But the Self isn't a teaching point, it's what is Really there.  The
Self is there whether the mind is or is not there, but the mind is never
there without the Self.
