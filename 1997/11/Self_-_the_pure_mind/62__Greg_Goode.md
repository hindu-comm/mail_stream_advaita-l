Would you really say "Reality"?  How about this alternate description:

   In the waking state the mind and body are felt.

Yes, sometimes the same things happening to the body in the dream state are
actually happening to the body in the waking state.  But the dreamer
doesn't know this, the waker does.

Who sets the standards?  Sastra, I'd say.  You know about these equivalencies:

  Brahman identified with the waking mind/body is called VAISVANARA
  Brahman identified with the dreaming mind is called TAIJASA
  Brahman identified with the deep sleeper is called PRAJNA

Let's say the mind DOES shut down in deep sleep.  How is it that you know
that consciousness is absent during deep sleep?  Something must be there to
record the coming and going of consciousness, the coming and going of the
mind.  The something is the Self.

Because the Self is there even if consciousness is not there.  Nisargadatta
is a good one to read about this, he's clearer than most other teachers on
this point.

A swami told me recently :-) that none of these models should be taken as
absolute metaphysical truths.  They are teaching points, to get the student
to stop identifying with the body, mind, causal body, or one of the 5
sheaths, etc.  You don't need any proof (just careful introspection) to see
that there is Something that sees whatever appears in any of the 3 states
in the world, and that this see-er itself cannot be seen.  This is the
Self, and it's not really that mystical....
