<<
 A swami told me recently :-) that none of these models should be taken as
 absolute metaphysical truths.  They are teaching points, to get the student
 to stop identifying with the body, mind, causal body, or one of the 5
 sheaths, etc.  You don't need any proof (just careful introspection) to see
 that there is Something that sees whatever appears in any of the 3 states
 in the world, and that this see-er itself cannot be seen.  This is the
 Self, and it's not really that mystical....

Beautifully put, Greg.
