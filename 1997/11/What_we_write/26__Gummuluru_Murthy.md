I hesitate in accepting this fully. Often I expressed my understanding of
the analysis of the great achAryAs like Shri Shankara. Also, quite often,
I expressed my understanding of a matter. Is it necessary to have a
scriptural reference or a great acAryA's commentary all the time ? I agrre
that if we do not follow either a great teacher's commentary/work or the
upanishhad or gita itself, it can become a free-for-all. But, here we are
practising advaita. Practising advaita is knowing what we are and a
bookish or intellectual knowledge is not sufficient. I am interested in
hearing List members' views on this.
