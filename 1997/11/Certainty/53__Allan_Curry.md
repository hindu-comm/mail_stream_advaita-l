    This reminds me of Zen being able to dispense with Zen
    and still be Zen precisely for that reason. What you say
    about "this certainty" being unable to tell you there is
    a self or atman really appeals to me because I am
    absolutely certain of X but absolutely uncertain as to
    what X is. If there is no need to complete the equation
    X = ? then I'm done. I am X without the slightest shadow
    of a doubt. Is that all there is to it?
