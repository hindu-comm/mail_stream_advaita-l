        Yes, there is nothing to know about X. However, the statement that there
is nothing to know about X is an abstraction for me, because I know. There
is no not-knowing but knowing projecting the state of freeing oneself from
the known.  So infact this very demand to be free from the known is the one
that is creating the problem. Which is of course why the renunciation of
renunciation is so important (and yet it can't be practiced: "whomsoever it
chooses, to him it is revealed").
