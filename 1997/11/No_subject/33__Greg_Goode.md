What about Shankara's way of deciding?

     Brahman is real.
     The world is unreal.
     The world is Brahman.

This way, you can say that the world is neither real, nor unreal, nor both.

Agree, recognition more important than intellectual belief.

But what is this "your own consciousness"?  As something seen, it itself is
part of the world.  So are the "you" whose consciousness this supposedly
is.  If everything is (potentially) unreal, then, as Ramesh Balsekar is
fond of pointing out, you can't leave yourself out of the equation.

Don't realized sages know?  What definition of real and unreal are you
using here?

The concept of nothingness is not really an advaitic concept, is it?   And
I sort of agree with you on this:  if you feel one of these concepts will
lead you to a void, then don't focus on that concept.  Instead of focussing
on what is UNreal, why not focus on what is REAL, e.g. Brahman??
