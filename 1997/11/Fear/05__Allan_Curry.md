I think there is a great deal of truth in what you say
here and I am reminded about something the New Testament
says, "love casteth out fear" or something to that
effect. Maybe love can overcome the six great enemies.
God is Love and we become God when we love God completely.
That undifferentiated Oneness is also the fruit of the
jnana path (IMO). Do others agree?

Jai Ambe indeed!
