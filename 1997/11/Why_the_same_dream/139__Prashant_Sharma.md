        You can refine the thesis in the following way.  The mind is like
an atmosphere that all living beings share.  We have our own antennas to
catch vibrations of this atmosphere: these form our experiences.  We
"know" that there are other beings because they affect the atmospheres
vibrations (a very physical way of thinking!).  We know them only through
this effect.  There is no other way of knowing reality, hence we
are stuck with second hand knowledge (there is nothing like knowing
reality per se). All this is "maya" which is discarded as soon as truth is
realized.  There is no origin of this maya (you know the "standard"
arguments for this I believe :).  One either breathes this atmosphere or
finds another technique of breathing which dissolves all dependence on
this atmosphere.
Hope this modification is satisfying.
Regards,
Prashant.
