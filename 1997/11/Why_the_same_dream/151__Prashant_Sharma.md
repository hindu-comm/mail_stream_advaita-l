In the following I will attempt to explain the statement: "mind is like an
atmosphere that all living beings share". First, let me ask you what
exactly do you mean by consciousness?  We are conscious, aware, only
through thought.  Even dogs use thought, albeit in a simple manner.  We
have added the complexity of language that is the "only" difference.
Thought is not yours or mine; it is our common inheritance. There is no
such thing as your mind and my mind there is only *mind*---the totality of
all that is felt and experienced by man.  Your earlier objection to this
was that :
>>...I do not like the "only one mind which is the sum total of
human experiences". Expressed like that, the sum total seems the result
from the previous experiences. A sort of collective memory. The problem is
that also my dog seems to share much of my dream. He also seems to like
looking at the full moon, avoiding the blazing Spanish sun, etc.>>

(I should apologize for being conservative enough to include only "human
experiences" :)

 You see in the "totality" an element of time,a collective memory.  The
point is there is nothing novel
that you and I dream.  The dreams are all the same things: jigsaw puzzles
that can be fitted in various ways to give a semblance of "novelty".
There is nothing new going on here.  Therefore,
there is a totality of knowledge which comprises the *mind*.
 Let me attempt to clarify this matter in a slightly different way.  The so
called present is nothing but an "operative" past. It is born of the past,
it has no seperate existence.   And it will lead to a future, which being
based on the past can't be different from it.  Actually the "true" present
is when the past doesn't operate: this is the here and now, which shall not
change.  But in this "true" present we do not exist. The question what
exists (consciousness or unconsciousness?) is seemingly meaningless since
the instrument that answers it is simply not there in the "true" present.
So we can say that our existence is in the past and in the future which is
born of this past.  Which brings us back to the totality...
This totality is the *mind* which is "maya".  Our individuality is in this
*mind*.  Everything that hapens to us is in this mind (and in some sense,
because of this mind). It is in this sense that one can say that we are all
thinking and functioning in an "atmosphere" that we all share.
I hope this is clarifying.

        I am sorry but I dont remember having written this.
