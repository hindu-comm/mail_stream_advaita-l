 Firstly, this discussion and the topic are at the vyavahaarika level
 where the concept that there are many jeevas is acceptable and is valid.
 Many jeevas have many minds. And these many minds create the many worlds
 and hence these worlds are different. I still do not see evidence that all
 these minds create only one world.

Yes. I experience it similarly, Greg. Does delight know from whence it arose?
"I"seriously doubt it, but "Delight", when it takes over completely, has no
notion of "Source". Doesn't this notion of "Source" arises from the apparatus
of experience and expression. This apparatus appears for a purpose that could
never be fathomed by anything but the apparatus itself.  So it would appear
that mind can never create anything, unless by the word "create" one means a
relative process(like one billiard ball hitting another and "causing" a
transfer of energy.  But this kind of "causing" is surely not "Causality").
So  with humor but I suggest that maybe it's just a question of using capital
letters where necessary.
