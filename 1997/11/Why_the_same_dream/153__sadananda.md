Obviously the snake-rope example is only to illustrate the superpostion of
apparent on the real - that is the extent of its usefulness.

But regarding existence itself - I just quated Chandigyopanishad in my mail
"Re: Perspective" - where it said "Existence was there in the begining
before creation and that existence was one without a second. -
Interestingly Uddalaka continues - in his teaching which I omited - that
"some say - non-existence was there before the creation (asateva idam agra
aseet - ekameva adviteeyam - tasmat astaH sajjayate) _ and it was one
without the second - from that non-existence  existence came - then He
questions how can that be possible - how can existence can come from
non-existence.  So he dismisis the statement and reemphasies his original
statement - sadeva somya idam agra aseet - ekamevaadviteeyam.

Essentially non-existence cannot come from existence.  If there is only
non-existence in the begining then how does one know that. At least there
must be a conscious entity (chaitanya vastu)  who is aware of the existence
of non-existence.  But at least that conscious entity must exist in order
for it to be conscious of the existence of the non-existence.  But we are
back to the base - that existent conscious entity is what we are originally
refering as it exists.  Hence there cannot be non-existence in the
begining.

Negation can not lead you to void because negation can only be done by a
conscious entity.  Suppose one for argument sake negates the Absolute one.
But what one cannot negate absolutely is the negator, who is a conscious
entity. And that is the obsolute existence we are talking about or we are
that. Conscious existence which is also anada since it is ekameva adviteeya
is a must that cannot be absolutely negated.  That is the sat chit and
ananda that I am. Everything else can be negated including the concept of
Brahman. That is why I maintain I donot need scriputures to prove that I
am.  What scripture tell me and which is also logical is that I am not only
existence, consciousness, I am ananda too.  There I need a reinforcement
from shastras.
