Namaste.

My understanding (which may be wrong) is the following:

Yes, we see the same Milky Way and the same Earth and the same continents
because we are indoctrinated by the same maaya. If two or n persons have
the same reaction to an event, that does not make that event any real. If
we (and I mean by we, our intellect) ever go beyond the wake-up state, we
still see the Milky Way, the Earth and so on, but we see it all as one,
with no difference. I attribute this seeing of duality to our being
indoctrinated by maaya. Let us take a child who does not know the
difference between a snake and a rope. The child would be playing with the
snake as she would be playing with a rope. For that child, there is no
snake and she is not afraid of snakes. Only after our indoctrination
by maaya, do we see the difference between the snake and the rope and our
superposition of the snake on the rope.

For a realized person, there is still the world, the Milky Way and the
continents. Yet, the realized person sees them for what they are, just
superpositions on Nirguna Brahman. For that person, there is no
difference between the Milky Way, the continents and the world. They
are all unreal, just like characters in a dream.
