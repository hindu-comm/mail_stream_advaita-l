This is effectively addressed by Prashant Sharma's statement: "The mind is
like an atmosphere that all living beings share."  To further elucidate:
There is one universal Self (paramatman), manifesting one universal Mind
(mahamahat) which, like the one aether (mahakasa), is all-pervasive and
discoverable beneath the *appearance* of the multiplicity of jivas
inhabiting the specter of their world.  That is, the reason the world
appears the same to us is because we're basically operating through one
Mind, with *apparently* multifarious egoistic overlays.  And it's this
latter delusion that tricks us into believing we're multiple jivas with
multiple minds.  (It's important to remember that this is just a
philosophical strategy, designed to quell the anguish of the inquiring
mind, in an attempt to rationalize the nature of its fantastic works;
and not a testimonial for defining a truth.)

This [one Mind] idea was also alluded to by yourself (below):
