Yes, but what is the *I*?  If it's Brahman, then what's wrong with the
consequences?

With the *my* there, you've now got an owner and an owned, e.g., *me*, and
then *my consciousness*.

How about something shorter than "I am conscious"?  How about "I am"?  Or
"I"?  Or "am"?  Or "is-ness"?

You really needn't worry about proving whether you are conscious or not.
Any effort either to confirm or deny it will result in its confirmation.

Why not?  By capitalizing "Mine," you are speaking from the standpoint of
the Absolute.  This is not just another anthropomorphic entity -- it is the
unseen seer, without personal attributes.  It is the Only thing that is
truly real.  To say this is not to assert solipsism.  To say that the
Absolute is the only source and substance of consciousness is not
solipsism.  The Absolute can never be accused of solipsism!

Not at all.  Only if you "steal" concepts from a personal entity and
attribute them to the Absolute.  Left to itself, the Absolute doesn't worry
about individuals' minds or whether it is

Why think that life, death, phenomenal points of consciousness, delusion,
and events of enlightenment are any more real than anything else?  Ramana
Maharshi said that none of these exist, and so does the Gaudapada Karika:

    (2.32) There is neither dissolution, nor birth;
           neither anyone in bondage, nor any aspirant
           for wisdom; neither can there be any seeker
           for liberation, nor any liberated as such.
           This alone is the Supreme Truth.

To this I can't add anything.  I bow before the wisdom of Sri Gaudapada!!
