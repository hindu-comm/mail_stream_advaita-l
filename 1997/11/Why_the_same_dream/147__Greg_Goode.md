I didn't write this!  What is the vyavahaarika level?  Relative?  Within
avidya?  What is the other level?  I think the original question as to "why
the same dream" was being asked at the absolute level, or maybe taking
concepts from each level and mixing them.  If we understand everything at
the vyavahaarika level only, then why not just accept one of the creation
stories?
