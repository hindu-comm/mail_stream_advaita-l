Namaskar

I thought Greg's distinction between consciousness and awareness was a good
one. I've also read the same distinction labelled "consciousness-of" as
opposed to "consciousness-without-an-object" (pure consciousness).
Obviously consciousness-of is absent in deep sleep state by definition but
also by definition consciousness-without-an-object remains precisely
because the objects (sense perceptions and thoughts) are absent. Actually
there is only one consciousness but the appearance and disappearance of
apparent objects in it gives rise to the above distinction.  Or so the
books I read seem to say.

bye for now,

Allan
