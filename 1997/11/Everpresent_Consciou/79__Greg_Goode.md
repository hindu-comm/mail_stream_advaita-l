OK, I see what you're saying.  If in deep sleep it IS consciousness
dropping out, then what is still there?  SOMETHING has to be there, or
there wouldn't be any registry of the coming and going of waking and sleep
states.  So if consciousness comes and goes, then maybe you can say that
awareness remains.

Ramesh Balsekar gives a hierarchy of consciousness which goes like this:

  (1) Consciousness at rest -- Nirguna Brahman
  (2) Consciousness in movement -- Non-localized consciousness, the Witness
alone
  (3) Embodied consciousness -- I am
  (4) Attached consciousness -- I am this body, mind, etc.

Though Ramesh adheres to the ajata-vada theory of creation (i.e.,
non-creation), he interprets creation stories of the jiva as an evolution
from (1) to (4).  And the reverse process is the road to enlightenment.
Once a person gets a taste of (3), they are a seeker, and the process of
enlightnment is the successive dis-identification and non-localization of
consciousness.  That which is at stage (2) is witnessing stage (3).

Enlightenment is staying at (3), sometimes (2) if there's nothing to
witness.  (1) can not be described, because there are no appearances, no
world at all.

Yes, many teachers say to watch out for this same thing that happens every
morning.  It is the movement from Balsekar's stage (2) to (3) to (4).  With
this model, you CAN say that you can witness consciousness, because it's
(2) witnessing the stages below it.
