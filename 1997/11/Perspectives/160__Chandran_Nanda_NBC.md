Every time I read the Upanishads, I find the no-duality concept quite
stark and obvious. It might be that, in the interpretations that I read,
the author(s) favours the Advaitam perspective. But I would like to know
how Ramanuja and Madhva interpret statments like 'Tat vam asi' and 'Aham
Brahmasmi' in their respective schools, which refute non-dualism. Can
the knowledgable clarify?
