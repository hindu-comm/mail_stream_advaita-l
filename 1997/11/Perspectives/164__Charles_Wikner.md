No, I have not read dvaita commentaries, but I have come across the
given explanation in advaita commentaries somewhere: it is one of
those useless bits of information that clutter the mind.  The original
question sounded like curiosity rather than anything of real concern,
so I have not looked for references, nor did I follow up the other
half of the question about aham brahmaasmi.

I don't know Radhakrishnan's standpoint (whether he is advaitin or not),
but the phraseology given above seems to draw attention to the advaita
aspect of Ramanuja's interpretetation.

According to advaita there are three levels of reality from the relative
standpoint: vyaavahaarika (the normal empirical life), praatibhaasika
(apparent, illusory), and paaramaarthika (highest goal, supreme truth).

It is not opposed to anything, nor is there a distinction: for example,
the existence of a flower and the existence of the Absolute, are the
same Existence.  It is a question of scale rather than polarity: hence
my comment that reason is more appropriate to the advaitin than logic.

Charles.
