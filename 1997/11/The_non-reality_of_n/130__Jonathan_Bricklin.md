Yes.

Between them and everything else.  This is standard Advaitn stuff is it
not?

"Tat tvam asi means the affirmation of a common ground, viz.,
consciousness, to the individual and Brahman.  The identity is obtained by
stripping away the incompatible or contradictory elements of the "that" and
"thou" and thereby arriving at their common elements or basis."  (Eliot
Deutsch, _Advaita Vedanta_, p. 49)

Nisgardatta's attempts to chart a territory beyond this common ground are,
in my estimation, wanting.
