    Is the author of the above quote the one who has never
    been here or is the author of the above the "Self" which
    alone "is present"? If the author is the Self who alone
    is present, then does the author also have certain
    knowledge of the fact they are that Self? If the author
    is the one who is not "here" how do they know what *is*
    here, or know anything at all?
