Does this happen all the time in deep sleep, or only some nights?

I don't understand, could you please rephrase this one?


   "black*ins*, in which the memory of all but the last moment is remembered."

Some teachers, such as Nisargadatta, use the words a bit differently.  He'd
say that awareness is always there, but consciousness comes and goes with
deep sleep, etc.  Awareness being that which watches the coming and going
of consciousness, even the creation/dissolution of universes.  These word
usages took some getting used to, but I'm now comfortable with the
Nisargadatta way of looking at things.  It's clear that for Nisargadatta,
awareness is Brahman.

Om!
