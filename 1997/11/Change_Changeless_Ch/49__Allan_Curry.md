    I've read scriptures which put it almost exactly as you
    have and I "believe" it is true. The question I've been
    wrestling with for the last few weeks concerns those
    people who imagine they have realized they are the SELF.

As I just wrote to someone else off the list:

    If enlightenment is no more than the recognition that
    there is no one here who recognizes there is no one
    here, then "I" am enlightened without a doubt. The doubt
    is that this is not enlightenment and non-people who say
    so are not enlightened either.


regards,
