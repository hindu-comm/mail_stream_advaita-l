        I think that what you are asking is some kind of a definition of
enlightenment.  I dont see how it is possible to give such a definition
but allow me to say that if one looks at the life of enlightened souls
then one thing stands out very clearly and that is an element of
certainty.
This certainty "burns" away all the doubts that one has.  Also it cannot
be conveyed since it is not an idea. This certainty cannot even tell you
that there is a "self" or an "atman" or any such abstraction. Its
my personal feeling that such abstractions are expressions of doubt and
therefore pervade the world of the "unrealized".

Regards,
Prashant.
