Yes, and although it might represent the ultimate transcendental state of
consciousness, does it effectively represent the import or esseence of the
shudda chit or chidakasa of the satchidananda?  Thus, I can't agree with
Ramesh's intimation that nirguna brahman is comprehensively That (not that
this implies any indictment on his excellent teachings).  I always regarded
pure consciousness to be congruent with yet beyond the wholistic blend of
nirguna/saguna brahman, which may be referred to as parabrahman.  And, as
you suggested in the title of this thread, we *can't* be discussing this,
even though we are!...(both and neither, equally).  Nevertheless, these are
all arbitrary and expendible ideas...whose sole function is to get us to
laugh our way out of the ego-Mind jail.

Namaste.
