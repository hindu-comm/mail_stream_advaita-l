While replying to specific mails, I request the list members to type
their message up front (before the original message) and not later,
particularly if their message is short. Of course, this need not be
followed when specific paragraphs are addressed, or if the attached
original mail is reasonably short. Thanks.

namo nArAyaNA,
govindarajan
