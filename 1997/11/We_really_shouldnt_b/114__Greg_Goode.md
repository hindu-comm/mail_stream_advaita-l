I've got an audiotape where Balsekar says the same thing.

Balsekar says this too, so does his disciple Wayne Liquorman.

Is this a problem?  Are you thinking that if you can't make sense of one
without the other, then we aren't correctly describing the nirguna side,
where it seems that it should be able to exist without there being any
quality-filled counterpart?  There are times where "at rest" is without the
"in motion" side.  But the terms don't seem that problematic to me.  Also,
can't you say the same for the Nirguna/Saguna Brahman distinction?  And if
we all accept Deutsch's point, why worry about the particular defects of a
particular term?

Five ideas come to mind, as we seek to speak about the unspeakable:

1. As I remember, the first couple of verses of the Rig Veda say
   something about it, not using the term "Nirguna Brahman."
   Have to check at home.

2. Balsekar also says "the emptiness of the void is the same
   as the fullness of the plenum."

3. Wayne Liquorman uses the term "featureless" instead of
   "without qualities."

4. Jean Klein and Francis Lucille use "silence."

5. Gangaji uses "That which is always there."
