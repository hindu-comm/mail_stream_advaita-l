Agree!

I think I meant "nirguna side" of the notional distinction.

That's true.  Ramesh once said that if all sentient beings
all perished, there would be nirguna Brahman only.  In pralaya, the
cosmic dissolution, all there is is nirguna Brahman.  Along with
nirguna Brahman goes the ajati vada theory of (non)-creation, where
the world is not created at all, but appears as an uncaused
appearance in Brahman, and identical with Brahman.  The world is not
unreal, because it is identical with Brahman, and not real because it
is appearance and not self-existent.

I agree.
