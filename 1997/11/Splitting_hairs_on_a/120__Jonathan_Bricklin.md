1.  You *can't* make sense of one without the other.

2.  Nirguna Brahman, by definition, cannot be described.

3.  What is a nirguna side?  It's all inclusive isn't it?  This sounds more
like noumena/phenomena partioning.

Conceivability is not one of those times..


 >Also, can't you say the same for the Nirguna/Saguna Brahman distinction?

Yes, to the extent that Nirguna Brahman is conceived as Brahman "in
itself," and the "in itself" only makes sense in relation to the "for a
jiva" of  Saguna Brahman.  But that is hardly an argument for taking a
phenomonal quality and absolutizing it.

I'm not worried about it I'm just responding to it.  As others respond to
what they see as the defects in my terms.
Nor do I believe that   "Whatever is expressed is
ultimately non-Brahman, is ultimately untrue" is an invitation to
say whatever you want about Brahman.  To me, Nirguna Brahman is everything
that
ever is was or will be now.  It can't be spoken of because there is no
vantage
point outside of it to connect with a prepositional bridge:  no "of", no
"about".

 In a sense, if you accept that Brahman is the totality of all that is, was
or will be now,
that *is* saying the same thing as that it is "at rest."  If  there is no
real separation between
past, present and future then
there is no real change either, and rest is all there is.  This is what
Parmenides believed.  An
incomprehensible rest, but rest nonetheless.  Perhaps Balsekar is getting
at that when he says
"the emptiness of the void is the same  as the fullness of the plenum."
But if it is, he need not turn the lights out to get there.

At any rate, all the voids, darknesses, silences, so apparently
beloved by the Nisgardatta school of the Absolute, cannot, conceivably, go
it alone.

You saved the best for last!
