    What would the author of the above say about this
    indeterminate source or ground of their own information?
    Would the author of the above say it is the atman or
    would the author of the above say they don't know
    whether it is or is not the atman? If the author
    does not know what is and is not the atman, how does
    the author know what the atman can and cannot say about
    other egos and their relationship to the atman?
