A jiva called Allan is asking of course. Was there some
kind of significance to your question? If you press and
ask what is this jiva called Allan I will say, "I don't
know" but what would that prove?  What I can't do is go
on to say what the atman can and cannot say about all
the egos in the world and their relationship to atman
as you did. I'm wondering what makes you think you can.

I didn't ask you whether your statements were true or false and
you did not answer the questions I did ask which were (to the effect)...

This is not your website, you needn't quote it's disclaimer again.
If you just don't want to answer fairly simple straight forward
questions, you don't have to.
