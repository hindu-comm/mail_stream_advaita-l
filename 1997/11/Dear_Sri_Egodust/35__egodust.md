As the disclaimer states, it is left up to the reader to determine
the truth or falshood of the statements made.

Now, is the author the atman or not?  Who's asking?

Any person making the claim, as well as the claim itself,
'I am a jnani,' are respectively a moron and an oxymoron.
(sorry, I couldn't resist that one!)

It's funny but it's true.  And yet, strangely enough, the obverse,
'I am an ajnani,' is equally absurd because it postulates the
existence of something that can have no real existence.

This is why there can be no conceptual answer to the atmavichara.

OM shaanthi.  Namaste.
