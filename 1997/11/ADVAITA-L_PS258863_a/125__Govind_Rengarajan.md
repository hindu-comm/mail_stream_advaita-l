Namaste,

My name is Pankaj Sharma and my interest in Vedanta is to learn and
practice techniques that will help me to live in peace with my Self.  If
I can be at peace with my Self then I can be at peace with All that is.
I want to know more about my purpose here on Earth so that I can carry
that out.  Peace and joy are my divine inheritance and I accept.

Looking forward to hearing from all of you.
                                        In Peace and Love,
                                        Pankaj.
