        I think it is necessary. Of course, there are exceptions
        like Ramana Maharshi (one can argue his case too). It is my
        opinion (for whatever it is worth) that one has to prepare
        oneself (purify) until one is ready for a physical guru. So
        if you are being naive, well, there are some of us also who
        are being naive :-)
