Namaskar

    I know this might be out of bounds for Advaita-L but I
    was wondering what status the Narada Bhakti Sutras have?
    Are they considered to be totally authoritative or
    somewhat marginal texts?

    One line from the Bhakti Sutras about the efficacy of
    meeting realized beings made me wonder what place the
    guru has in the jnana path? I remember reading Atmananda
    (Sri Krisna Menon) say there was virtually no other
    way of realizing jnana other than to have the truth
    spoken directly to you by a realized being. He seemed
    quite certain and clear about this. Reading the words of
    an enlightened being was not at all the same thing in
    his view and just would not do.

    Of course it would be very very nice to meet a realized
    being but do you think it's as necessary and beneficent
    as Atmananda and Narada say? I've always felt it to be
    so, but am I just being naive?


Sincerely,

Allan Curry
