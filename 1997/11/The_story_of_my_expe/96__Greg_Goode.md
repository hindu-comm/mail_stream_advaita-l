This means either that according to a Vedantin, either (a) there are no
duties in non-Vedic cultures, or (b) all proper duties in all cultures have
their source in the Vedas.  Do you mean something like (a) or (b)?

What about to a non-traditionalist?  To a traditionalist, what caste am I a
member of?

Yes, we are modern people, using a modern means of communication,
discussing the relevance of ancient ideas to our modern lives.  We are
using modern languages and dialectic.  (Ghandiji was a modern man too.)
All of our discussion seems to pile more and more evidence in favor of the
generalizability of this marvelous scripture.  My subject here is not
Ghandi as Gita expositor; rather I'm arguing against a culturally,
temporally or literalistically narrow view of the Gita as being the only
valid view.  Time and history will prove that there are other valid, wider
views.

Cultural relativism IS a modern notion, so?  And yes, pre-modern societies
all did have the notion of "our own" and then the unbelievers/barbarians.
How does this relate to the discussion of the Gita?  Are you saying that
because the Gita was written under the pre-modern mind-set, it must even
NOW be taken in a way that ignores all cultures it wasn't written under?
Can't Krishna's karma yoga explanations be relevant to the modern corporate
warrior, on the eve of a hostile takeover transaction??

Precisely!  You see, the very fact that it withstands cultural, temporal
and linguistic translation is even more evidence of its profundity and
greatness for all.

OM!
