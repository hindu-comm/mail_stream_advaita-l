So you mean if I say Ram Chandran posted a message to Advaita-L on Friday
14th, we cannot determine the truth or falsehood of that statement?  Sure
we can.  Similiarly what I've said about Gandhiji can be found true or
false though more effort may be needed.

Which is precisely what i'm doing.  And if I'm not it should be easy to
point out my illusions.

Again I fail to see why what I said should be considered evidence of ego
or misunderstanding.  I've pointed out my reasons for what I've said and
so far you've only offered me platitudes in response.

My late Grandfather on my mothers side was a svatantra sainik who later
became a Congress MLA in Gujarat.  He'd met all the big shots Gandhiji,
Sardar Patel etc.  I don't think his religious views were affected by any
of them.  Why should mine?

I have.  What it is saying is that one should rigidly follow dharma
irrespective of its worldly consequences.  Where I'm saying Gandhiji is
misinterpreting the Gita is in assuming dharma == some universal morality.
Certainly there is an overlap between between dharma and morality and
some dharma applies to all people but they are not the same.  Choosing
between the universal value of Ahimsa and the particular Kshatriya duty of
warfare, Krishna Bhagawan clearly comes down in favor of the latter.

There you go then.  As Krishna Bhagawan is clearly arguing in favor of the
bloodthirsty violence in this case, you must agree He is arguing against
ahimsa.  And if there is even one case like this, ahimsa is not a
universal value.

> Do we have a yardstick for judging people?

Unequivocally YES.  Dharma is called a danda because like a stick it is
straight and strong.  Our shastras and teachers are a true guide to
judging anyone and anything.  Furthermore, history and our own ability
to read and think can and must be employed to the fullest.
