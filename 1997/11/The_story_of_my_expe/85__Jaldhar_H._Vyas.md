Gandhiji was great in many ways but unfortunately is unreliable as an
interpreter of the Gita.

First of all, how can anyone derive a philosophy of ahimsa from the Gita
which takes place at the beginning of a huge and bloody war?  A war which
Arjuna actually tries to avoid.  He makes the ahimsak arguments, arguments
which Krishna Bhagawan decisively rejects.  Gandhiji may have projected
his ideas onto the Gita but it's more likely he got them from Jainism
which is quite strong in Gujarat.  In fact in his caste, Jains and
Vaishnavas intermarry.  In his autobiography he also mentions the Jain
thinker Raichand (Rajchandra) as being one of his influences.

Secondly, even by the standards of a typical Gujarati Vania of those days,
he was not particularly learned in religious matters.  He was raised in
the Pushti Marg (the Vaishnava sampradaya founded by Vallabh.  their
philosophy is called Shuddhadvaita Vedanta.) But it is not apparent from
his writings that he had more than a nodding aquaintenance with its
philosophy.

Sounds like you've been reading some Swaminarayan propoganda.  I'm sure
it's read lovingly by the members of that sect but hardly Gujaratis in
general.
