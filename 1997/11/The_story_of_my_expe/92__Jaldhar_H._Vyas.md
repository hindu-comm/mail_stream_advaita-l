To a Vedantin of any stripe any source duty which does not derive from the
Vedas is illegitimate.

To a traditionalist the idea of a person with no caste is an
oxymoron.

As an aside, here, Advaita Vedanta is a little at odds with the
mainstream of Vedic tradition because it says that there can be such a
person.  For one who is on the path of Moksha there is no obligation to
follow any of the ritual observences and no obligation to society
whatsoever. This is probably why modern Indians seized on Advaita as the
putative "source" for their thinking (when it was really 19th century
Western liberalism)  However looking at the facts it is obvious that
Advaita is not at all revolutionary and it was never its mission to
"reform" or uproot the traditional way of life.  For Shankaracharya the
only person who is capable of rejecting the duties of caste is the
sannyasi and a sannyasi rejects _everything_.  Thus any antinomian
potential the Advaita way of thinking may have had is effectively negated.

This is a modern notion.  Prior to the modern era, it wouldn't have
occured to anyone anywere to compare societies in such a relativistic
manner.  For the pre-modern person, there was their own society and there
were the unbelievers.  Sometimes the unbelievers were hated, sometimes
feared, but mostly they were ignored.

Maybe.  But your culturally translated Gita is different from _the_ Gita.
