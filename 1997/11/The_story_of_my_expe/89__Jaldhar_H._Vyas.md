Yes.  The Akshar Purushottam people are a splinter of the original
Swaminaryana Sampradaya but philosophically they're mostly the same. (They
revere the 19th century Swami Sahajanand who they call Swaminarayan as the
avatar of Vishnu Bhagawan.)  Their leader is Swami Narayanpurushdas.
(Pramukh just means chief or leader.)

The original Swaminarayan sect also has many mandirs all over the world.
Both are pretty popular amongst Gujaratis.
