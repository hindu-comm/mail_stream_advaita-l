The huge, glistening new mandir in the outskirts of London -- that's a
Swaminarayan Mandir also, isn't it?  The living swami it is associated with
is Pramukh Swami Maharaj, and he is of the Akshar Purushottam Faith.  I
visited the temple for a puja one day, and it's huge, new, very impressive.
 It's now a stop in the London tour circuits.
