What about the truth?  Does that not matter?

Which is why I don't rely on your interpretations or mine but on the

The language of the Gita is about as simple Sanskrit as you can get.
Relying on uneducated third-parties only needlessly complicates things.
It is obvious from reading the Gita that by karma yoga it means the duties
of caste and for Kshatriyas fighting is a much higher ethical value than
ahimsa.  Indeed that's how all the Acharyas have understood it.

And the action enjoined is bloodthirsty violence.  The very opposite of
ahimsa.

If I had said "Gandhiji was no good at basketball" would you have
considered it an insult?  I think we all understand that everyone isn't
good at everything.  It doesn't take away from anyones real
accomplishments to point out their bogus ones.

A comfortable illusion is an illusion nonetheless.  People are not always
honest with themselves.  Perhaps based on his limited understanding, he
did think he was following the teachings of the Gita but the fact is he
wasn't.

But his understanding of "the ahimsa weapon" did not come from the Gita.

My hometown is Rajkot, where Gandhiji was born.  The mandir I usually
attend follows the Pushti Marg.  I'm confident there's nothing baseless
about anything I've said.

Let's not forgot that first and foremost Gandhiji was a politician.  He
did a great service for India in that capacity but that doesn't say
anything the usefulness of his thoughts in any other field.
