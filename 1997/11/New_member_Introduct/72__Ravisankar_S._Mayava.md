Dear Ravi,
  Namaskaara. Let me start off by thanking you and everyone
involved in maintaining this excellent newsgroup. I have been
a passive reader of Advaita-L for almost two years, thanks
to your archives. My interest in philosophy grew amidst
teachers and peers at Purdue from where I graduated.
As you have alluded to in the welcome mail, practising
sincerely is my goal.  To this end, the hope is to contribute
something to this newsgroup.

Sruti smrti purAnam Alayam karunAlayam |
NamAmi bhagavadpAdam shankaram lOkashankaram ||

Best Regards
Satish
