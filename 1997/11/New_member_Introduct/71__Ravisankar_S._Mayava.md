Thank you for your warm welcome.

I have been a student of philosophy for more than 40 years and have
gradually become convinced that Advaita provides a teaching that can
satisfy the highest aspirations of man intellectually, emotionally and
practically.

I have studied and continue to study many passage from the Upanshads and
Bagavad-Geeta, and have the greatest admiration for the life and exposition
of these works by Adi Sankara.

I very much look forward to hearing more from you.

With friendly greetings.


John Barnes
