That is a very good point.
Can we postulate volition as separate from grace?
Does or does not volition have its origin in grace?
Where do we draw the line between grace and non-grace?
There is this example which says that grace is like sunlight which is
always there and that one has to turn towards the sun to see the light.
But, what makes one-in his/her current state-feel the need to turn towards
the light and actually turn?
