I do not see them as separate. The only difference is in how we interpret
the actions.

There is no volition to have an origin. Only the CONCEPT of origin.

There is no line. All is Grace.

I think it is the Grace which makes us turn in whatever direction we turn
in. Perhaps we should define 'Grace'.

To my way of thinking, this 'Grace' is consciousness - the very life force
which makes our heart beat, which digests our food, which keeps our lungs
expanding and contracting... how much volition is involved in these processes?

just a thought - my feeble two cents. . .

Isn't dream a good metaphor for the issue of will? To the dreamer, he is
responsible for his actions -- he simply can't run fast enough to escape the
tiger -- he's scared and frustrated. Relieved upon waking up, we realize
running only seemed to be in the power of the dreamer and that it might have
been kind of interesting to experience being devoured by the man-eater. God
knows, we might have had a healthy belch after the experience!

As for grace, would it have been grace to run like an olympian or trip on our
shoelaces and enjoy a good meal?

Doesn't Advaita argue to carry this image into waking? The real question
might be where does this relief come from when we do wake up?
