 Study of the Vedas and Upanishads should be a guide to probing deeply within
 oneself. Simply mastering the Vedas and the Upanishads at the intellectual
 level will not cause self realization. However, studying them *and*
 reflecting on their meanings will be much better. But simply probing
 deeply with no Guru or guide or basis in scripture is like thrashing empty
 husk.

 One more thing. Following the method of Vedaanta as taught by a Guru is
 different from  following the teachings of another or the teachings of a
 prophet. Vedaantic knowledge is apaurushheya, meaning it was not created
 by any person. So Vedaanta is not the teaching of an individual, which
 means we cannot attribute to it a narrow outlook and personal prejudices/
 errors that a human-authored text would have.

 Also, one need not be afraid of confusion. It may be a healthy sign of
 the weakening of the bonds of maayaa. With enough patience and study, the
 confusion  should disappear.
