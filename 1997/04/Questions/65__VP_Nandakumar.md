Hi,

        As days go by I have more and more questions!

        Would mastering the concepts of Advaita and the Vedas and Upanishads
actually result in one realizing the self? Or is it just a means of developing
your mind and soul and only in analyzing and understanding the reasons behind
one's thoughts, desires and needs and controlling them, would one realize the
Self?

        Do the Vedas or the Upanishads provide a way to realize the self? Even
if they did, would it be possible for one to realize the Self following the
teachings of another and face the problem of too much information which could
lead to confusion, instead of the simpler and clearer way of probing deeply
within oneself?
