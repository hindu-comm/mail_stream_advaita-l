In the light of the recent (very interesting) discussions on the
Kathopanishad and the subject of free-will, what is the status of a promise?
Is the making of a promise amd whether it is subsequently kept or not
equally predetermined (and therefore indeterminate)? Should we not indulge
in such practices? (Please no answers of the sort "Who is it who is making
the promise amd to whom?"!) :>).
