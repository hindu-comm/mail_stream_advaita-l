Is the buddhi the non-dual truth itself? If the buddhi is not the non-dual
truth then what else is it that discriminates between the buddhi and the
non-dual truth?  According to V.S.Iyer, the criterion of truth is that it
cannot be contradicted. Non-duality is non-contradictable because there
is nothing other than it. These things go together in a meaningful way
but I'm not exactly sure how to express it. Any comments?


Namaste!
