Hmm, never heard of this opinion. The books I have seen, one from
Sringeri, one from the Kanchi Mutt and one from R.S.Vadhyar and sons, a
famous publisher from Palghat, all mention only sUrya. The book from
kA.nchI also quotes from the smR^iti-s (bodhAyana  smR^iti I think) on
the relative positions of the mUrtis and also talks about other
pa.nchAyatana-s like the vishhNu pa.nchAyatana etc, but never makes any
mention of skanda.

Sorry, I mentioned the worship in temples only to indicate that shiva
being worshiped as somAskanda is nothing unusual.

Actually, as I mentioned my father's maternal grandfather's house had
worshiped skanda in idol form at home traditionally and my father has
taken it up after his grandfather passed away. I don't think there's any
restriction on worshiping skanda at home. I have seen it in other homes
also. I have heard all sorts of contradictory opinions about worship at
home of devata-s like durgA etc also. However AFAIK all these are
general opinions passed down by various people and have no basis in
actual smR^iti-s.

As far as shiva goes, the idea is that the li.nga is the most
efficacious and hence even in temples the main mUrti is always in li.nga
form. Refer shiva purANa for details. I believe the various shaiva
Agama-s say the same thing.

Ramakrishnan.
