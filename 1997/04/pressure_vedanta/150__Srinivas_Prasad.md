This Is in response to the question if India can accomadate
all the persons for realization (for American born etc).

First of all bottom of the heart how many of them are there in
 the world who wants sincerely dedicate themselves to realize GOD
or Realize Bramhan. I would say the number is very minimal
If all the members of this net + members of other net (similar)
put together we will get only about 10-20000 people. India
 is a place where it has given home for 5-6 million refugee
from Bangladesh, tibet, etc...

So for India it is no big deal to accomadate to these craving
10-20 000 spiritual men seeking truth. No doubt India is the only place
for realization if one wants to achieve. One has to ask him/herself
can I go there and adjust my self to that life style.

So far all the Realized persons are from Great India, to the
best of my knowledge.!!! If any one has realized sitting
in US or else where let me know....
