Namaste.

>         1. when so, who is this consciousness / deity / whatever?

        It is nondual awareness, pure consciousness, Brahman, Atman. But
these are all just names for something which can not be conveyed in words
since communication, by itself, is dualistic.

        You are asking why did avidya arise. But did avidya arise ? If the
question is put and enquired, then avidya disappears because it never
arose. The unreal never existed, and the real never did cease to exist.
What is mind ? A bunch of thoughts. Where do thoughts have it source ?
Find out.

>         4. when all is one ultimately, what is the reason for all this?
>         5. if this being derives pleasure from the emancipation of each

        These questions are raised and answered in great detail in the
mandukya upanishhad.h karika by Gaudapada. If you know sanskrit, you
can read it online, else, you can read the translation of the book by Swami
Nikhilananda which should be available in any philosophical bookstore in
Delhi. Another brief translation is available on the net,
        http://www.SATRamana.org/manduk.htm

        If you think there is a creation, enquire who see the creation,
are you the created or the creator ? Are the two different ?

Namaste.
