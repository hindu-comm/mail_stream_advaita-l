My intention is not to be dis-respectful, but pop-culture myths about the
efficacy of holy places are widely prevelant in India. Where exactly is this "no
punar-janma if one visits kA.nchI" mentioned? Is it any of the major purANa-s?
Such statements are to be taken as arthavAda to praise the xetra and not in any
other sense. That apart the kA.ncI temple is wonderful and the town has many
other wonderful temples.

Ramakrishnan.
