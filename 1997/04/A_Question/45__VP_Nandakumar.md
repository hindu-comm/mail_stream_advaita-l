Hi,

        I've got a question!

        Couple of days back I was reading an account on the history of Sankara
on the net and in that it was mentioned that Sankara set up four maths in
Shingeri, Puri, Dwaraka and Badrinath. I was surprised to find the math at
Kancheepuram missing, as that's the math which is revered in the south of India.

        So what's the the history behind the math at Kancheepuram?

Cheers,
Nanda
