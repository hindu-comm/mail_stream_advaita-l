I am reading a book by V.S.Iyer called "An Inquiry Into Truth" in which he
translates buddhi as reason and defines it to be the faculty which
determines true from false. Would anyone care to improve on this definition
of buddhi for those of us whose knowledge of Sanskrit approaches zero?

Thank you sincerely,
