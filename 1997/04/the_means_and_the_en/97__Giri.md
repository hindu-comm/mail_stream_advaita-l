        savikalpa progresses to nirvikalpa and then to sahaja nirvikalpa.
The 'Talks with Ramana Maharshi' has a table explaining the differences
between these states.
        Look at it this way, one purifies the mind and stays in the
natural state of nirvikalpa. Due to the inherent vaasanaa-s of the mind,
the person does not stay in that state and "comes out of it" Till all
vaasanaa-s are destroyed, sahaja nirvikalpa is not "attained." The first
can be compared to a bucket lowered in a well and then pulled out while
the latter is like the river running into the sea. After the river and
sea has been mixed, they can not be separated. Please don't carry the
analogies too far and say that there is no bucket, well, river, sea etc
only the Self.

Namaste.
