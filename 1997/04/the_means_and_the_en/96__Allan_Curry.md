Namaste!

Natarajan says in his commentary to the Ramana Gita that upasana is
"intermittent abidance in one's natural state" and that "knowledge is
intermittent during practice. It becomes steady by repeated effort."
[...] "The means and end are not different."

It would seem that authentic experience of the Self need not necessarily be
permanent according to Natarajan (Ramana too?).  As this very doubt has
often occured and caused much distress and confusion, I would be very
interested in hearing from others about their experience and understanding
of "intermittent abidance in the natural state" and "repeated effort".
