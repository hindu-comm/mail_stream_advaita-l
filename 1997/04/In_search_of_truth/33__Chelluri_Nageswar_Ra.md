Namaste!

You are right Prasad, in kaliyga "Narayana" is the only recourse for not just
NRI's but for the whole humanity.

The gist of Advaita is "Aham Brahma" .  If one experiences and understands
that, then there is no need for middle men/women called "Gurus".  Sri Ramana
Maharishi knows that  so can you.   When you have direct access why not take
advantage.

Chanting "Namo Narayana" every second of waking stage eventually leads to
chanting by self in all 3 states.   You can hear it what your self is
chanting.  I (an Ajnaani) experienced it so can everybody.

Regards                                                       Nageswarrao
