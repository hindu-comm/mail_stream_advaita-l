Nirvikalpa samadhi is a visitation to the turiya (or Fourth State), which
is *beyond yet envelops the 3 phases of Mind*, insofar as it combines the
waking and sleep phases.  It can be described as being empty and awake.
The sadhaka is encouraged, in fact, to bring the 'sleep attitude' into the
waking state.  When such visitation becomes permanent, it's described as
the sahaja state (turiyatita) of the jivanmuktha.

Namaste.
