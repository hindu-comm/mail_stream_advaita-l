Whatever the individual practices becomes part of his nature.

You are the Atman; it is Your Own grace that is readily available under
the conditions listed.

The Atman reveals Itself to Itself (which is what you ARE), and not to
some limited and separate individual (which is what you APPEAR to be).
This should serve to explain the reasonableness of the conditions.

`Knowledge' has come to mean the information grasped by the mind (manas),
whereas prajnaanam may be better translated as wisdom, intelligence,
discrimination (functions of buddhi).

         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That is not what is given in the Sanskrit:  prajnaanena indicates the
means by which Atman is attained, namely prajnaanam.  When the mind is
at peace, then the Atman sees Itself reflected as it were, in the still
and pure buddhi.

The `seeming' is due to assigning limited meanings to words (in this case
`knowledge'), and the failure to appreciate that a translation is also an
interpretation (i.e. depends on the translator's skill in the two languages,
as well as his spiritual understanding).  This does illustrate the necessity
to study the scriptures in the original language.
