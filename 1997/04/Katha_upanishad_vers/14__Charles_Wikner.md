The grace is always available: what is needed is to avail oneself of it.

Attempts at anything are fruitFUL: whether the fruit is conducive to
realisation is another matter.  Self-realisation itself is fruitless.

Striving is obviously for something other, which is of course duality;
however striving to let go of, or transcend, perceived limits tends
towards non-duality.  The passage from the Gita 18:20--22 is relevant
in the latter sense of striving: rajas to overcome tamas, sattva to
overcome rajas, in order to avail oneself of the grace.

"A thorn to remove a thorn, then discard both."

So long as one is under the dominion of ignorance, do not dismiss any
activity as `counter-productive': all activity is productive, but the
Self (and Its realisation) is not a product.

If the `giving in' is a movement from rajas to sattva, then yes, but
it is usually a movement towards tamas -- the sort of sophistry that
acknowledges fatalism and which allows the mind to do as it pleases.

Very good!  The key is in that little word `let'.

Personally, I find the in-depth study of the scriptures conducive to
`let' that happen: however, allowing the mind to be immersed in the
scriptures (and not the other way round) does involve `volition',
whereas deep meditation, or feeding the mind on the junk food of TV,
does not.
