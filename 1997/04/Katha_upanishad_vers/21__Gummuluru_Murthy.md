Most of the threads in this List seem to be ending up in the debate of
whether there is free-will. We all seem to have our own view about it.

On Tue, 15 Apr 1997, Charles Wikner wrote in the introductory sentence:

If Charles implies by this that there is much more in Katha u. I.2.23 - 25
than non-volition, I fully agree.

I expect the ego would love the idea of volition, because it gives
kartR^tva, a subject who does action and the ego identifies with that
subject.

If the ego loves the idea of non-volition for the reasons which Charles
gives above, then it indeed is a cop-out of the highest order for the
ego. Such ego is not even honest to itself. As I mentioned in my previous
posting, such ego (or jeeva) has a long way to climb before it is ready to
face the question "Who am I ?".

Katha u. verses I.2.1 to I.2.6 aptly describe the scenario given by
Charles above.

Katha u. I.2.1 to I.2.6 describe sreyah and preyah (the good and the
pleasant. Both the good and the pleasant approach the man. The wise one
discriminates between the two having examined them well. The wise man
"prefers" the good to the pleasant, but the fool "chooses" the pleasant
through attachment. [I put "chooses" and "prefers" in quotations above
because I think it is an apparent choice only. There is no choice left for
the jeeva. Jeeva only _thinks_ it is making a choice.]

Lord Yama says in Katha u. I.2.6

"To the ignorant people, befooled by the delusion of wealth, the path of
the hereafter never appears. The person who thinks "This is the only world
and there is no other" thus falls into my (Lord Yama's) control again and
again."

I would amend this to say  "... and where there is ego, there is a
thinking that there is volition. ...."
^^^^^^^^

I do not see them to be contradictory. If the buddhi is dharmic, I mean
by being dharmic, that it has purity, it has control of the senses, in
which case, the mind, which is a conduit between buddhi and the senses
behaves in a sattvic way]

I do not understand. How can a mind kept under check by pure buddhi imply
volition ?

> The concept of non-volition is pure poison at the vyaavahaarika level;

I would like to know why it is pure poison at the vyavahaarika level.
Please keep in mind, unless we reach paramaartha level [unless the Self
chooses to reveal Itself to Itself], we are all in the vyavahaarika level.
We cover a wide spectrum ranging from where the jeeva thinks it is doing
everything to where the jeeva is in perfect harmony with non-volition.

Not only non-volition, any view is at vyavahaarika level only. However,
would you not agree that, of all the views held at vyavahaarika level,
non-volition may be the noblest. At least, it recognizes that no
accomplishment is due to individual's own effort, but due to something
beyond. Non-volition (if honestly accepted) recognizes the limitations
of the ego.

Aren't all concepts based on belief only ? Whether it is by past spiritual
experience, or by intuition, they are still beliefs only. Even advaita is
a belief. The only tool which the human has to try to understand the Self
is logic. The human tries to fit it into his/her logical scheme. But
understanding the Self is beyond logic and beyond the perception of the
human mind.

With this, I fully concur.
