Namaste

        Can someone explain the concept or the correct practice of meditation?
is it just to sit with eyes closed and meditate Gayatri jabam to improve the
powers of concentration or is there something more to it? And is it really
necessary that it should be done at sunrise or at any particular time of the day
or in a particular yoga position? What does one expect to obtain out of the
practice?
