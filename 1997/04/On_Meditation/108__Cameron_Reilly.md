I think you'll find as many ideas about meditation on this list as we do
ideas about everything else.

My experience has been as follows.

My guru taught me that meditation is 'watching the thoughts'. He told me
that if I tried to stop the thoughts, that was foolish, because trying to
use the mind to stop the mind was futile.

Instead, he assured me that if, during meditation, I simply allowed the
thoughts to appear and disappear as they pleased I would notice how they
appear spontaneously... that "I" have no control over them... and I would
subsequently understand I was not the "me" but this sense of presence, this
feeling of "I Am". And that after a while I would experience meditation
always, without having to consciously set aside time for the practice.

And that this would be the start of understanding my true nature.

I hope this is of some help.


Regards,

Namaskar,

I just came accross a poem on Lord Krishna  which I would like to share:

"O Krishna

Born in the dark of night,
With the heavens in disarray,
Skin so dark and eyes so light,
The time was ripe, so they say.

Descended from the heavens above,
O Keshav, Keshav, Keshav.


Mischievous, gay and very naughty,
Could never resist a pot of butter.
While smile so sweet and words crafty,
Not a word could Yashodhra utter.

Like a kitten playing in wool,
In Gokul, Gokul, Gokul.


Fighting demons, frolicking at play,
The favourite of all around.
What he was they could not say,
But knew that greatness had been found.

Come to deliver the world from worry,
O Hari, Hari, Hari.


He feats with women are legendary,
Leaving none untouched by charm.
To nothing can love ever be secondary,
If the thought be right there is no harm.

>From lust and hate, love can save,
O Vasudev, Vasudev, Vasudev.


Took to battle for the sake of truth,
Being the Pandav s friend and guide.
His determination shall brook no ruth,
And leave no place for sin to hide.

Righteousness one should never shun,
O Janardhan, Janardhan, Janardhan.

To Arjun did he give this word,
Full of compassion on the front,
"It has been said and will be heard,
In the end shall evil bear the brunt."

Deliver us from fear and Trishna,
O Krishna, Krishna, Krishna.
O Krishna, Krishna, Krishna."

This has given rise to a queston; what is the status of Gods in advaita?
Are they real (in the same sense that man is real) or are they just
means for focussing one's attention? Is it possible to acquire Godhood?
Could someone comment please.

regards
