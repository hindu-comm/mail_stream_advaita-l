Hai,
      I would like to give my introduction from my birth.
I have taken birth in an orthodox Brahmin family in Vijayawada, AP,India.
with my grand mother I learnt the feelings of Hinduism and felt the
essence of it. I was much interested in advaitha it is only because my
relatives have an edge over it. basically we (our family) doesnt prech
Ramanuja charya or Madhvacharya philosphy not because they no it, it is
just because of the sub-caste feeling in Brahmins. I was interested to
learn these philosphy but because of the unavailability of resources I
could not. my uncle taught me the overall concept of dvaita,advaita and
visistadvaitha. but I'm still in dialama and will not be any more.
I have done my Post graduation in computer science and doing a job in
Wipro systems, hyderbad and I'm currently in US for a very small time.
I would like to see my self in the list.

Thanks u very much
Muppalla Srinivasa Pavan Kumar
