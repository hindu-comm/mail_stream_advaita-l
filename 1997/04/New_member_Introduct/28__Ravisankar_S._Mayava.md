Hello

   Thanks for including me in the ADVAITA List.

A brief introduction about me.  . My name is Naganna ( 27 yrs, M). I am
from Andhra Pradesh. I did  M.Tech from IIT Madras in Mechanical
Engineering.  I am presently working for  a software organization as
Systems  Manager  in Hyderabad.( Right Now I am in US on Company
Business . I will be here for a short period).

I became interested in Advaitam mainly because of writings of Swami
Vivekananda.  I  was convinced by Swamiji's lectures , that ADVAITA
philosophy is the final destination in  man's search for the Truth. It
logically answers all the questions   related to the human and divine
factors of our existence. The progress of science and human
understanding has only helped in reinforcing the theories put forward by
the ADVAITA philosophy, whereas many other theories have lost ground
 before the discoveries of  science and technology.

Of course, I confess that my understanding of the ADVAITA philosophy
is minimal. The main source of my understanding is Swami Vivekanada's
works supplemented by  some lecture's of Swamiji's of RK Mission and
a little reading of books on Upanishads.  I am hopeful that this discussion
group will help  in enriching my understanding of This great school of
thought.

With regards to All
Naganna
