OM NAMO BHAGAVATE SRI RAMANAYA!

Yes.  We have to be clear what Sri Bhagavan is saying here.  As He mentioned
elsewhere, "If the jiva is regarded as real, so is free will operable."
Yet this is true for the vyavaharika and, as such, it is the *dvaitamarga*.
However, if we're after moksha, why reinforce dvaita?  It's all well and good
for clearing the antahkarana, but the sadhaka should thereof be clear that
(s)he's adhering to, at best, visishtadvaitamarga.

He goes on to say that through parabhakthi or vijnana such responsibility
is only then relegated to Isvara.  Yet even [this] bhakti, if strictly
applied, winds up true advaita.  The sadhaka therefore must be clear what
(s)he is ready for.  I tend to believe many more are ready to assimilate
the radical innate fact that they are *already* Paramatman, and let such
buddhic seed be implanted within, and the stronghold of vasana-s will yield!

Namaste.
