Yes, that's what advaita and all advaita teachers have said. Ramana
Maharshi, for eg. makes clear that grace is always available and but can
be obtained only with effort. He also quotes Appar's poetry in this
regard. In fact in many places he has said this.

Yesterday, I just went to a friend's house to meet him. But he asked me
to stay for dinner. It was totally non-volitional. It just "happened".
So what? By your logic, my eating dinner yesterday is a major miracle.
Such things are explained by the teachers as a consequence of karma.

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What is that supposed to mean? Only a jnAni can act without volition.
Till then striving goes on and necessarily involves the will to a
certain extent. One can try not to be attached to the fruit of one's
action, but that again involves wilful striving, in some sense.

Ramakrishnan.
