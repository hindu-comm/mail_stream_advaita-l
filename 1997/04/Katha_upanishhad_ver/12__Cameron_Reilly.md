My friend, you are absolutely correct.

Which is why advaitic teachings exist in the first place, no? To lead
organisms to the source.

Much, much more.

You are absolutely correct. But any discussion about 'volition',
'scriptures', 'study', etc is based in phenomenality, no?

As I have said before, it has been my experience that understanding certain
phenomenal aspects of the manifestation (such as volition) can lead one to
*know* the non-dual brahman. Then there is no need for questions, for
words, for discussion... for ADVAITA-L. We can all go home and watch the
cricket...

>Does the body define all there is to the person?

Yes I believe so. Is there a person without a body? Is there a mind without
a body? Consciousness? Awareness? But we, of course, are much much more
than just a body.

Perhaps hard to believe but absolutely true and correct. And observable in
an instant by any of us.

Example:  You state "I decide to eat out."  Where did that thought come
from? Did you choose to think the "eat out" thought? Or did it appear
spontaneously in your consciousness?  "I choose to eat at the Thai
restaurant"... again, did you choose to think this thought? And if you
claim you did, I ask again - The thought "I choose to think this 'Thai
restauarant' thought" - where did *it * come from? Did you choose it or did
it appear spontaneously?

It has been my experience that thoughts, *all* thoughts, appear
spontaneously, are acted upon, and are retrospectively regarded as 'a
decision'.

I agree. Decision *are* made. But not through free will. They are made
automatically by the mind as a result of conditioning and biological
instincts. I urge everybody who hasn't already, to witness the thought
process carefully and ask yourselves the question: do I choose to think a
particular thought or does it appear spontaneously?

Thank you Vidyasankar for a very carefully thought out response. I am
enjoying this thread. However, I will be offline for about two weeks. Look
forward to continuing it when I return.

Respects,
