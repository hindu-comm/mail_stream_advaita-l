Dear Cameron,

     And thank you for your thoughtful post.

     Any effort in this regard is useless and counter-productive and yet,
paradoxically, must (at least seemingly) be "done."

     However, there is never a "do-er" of the "do-ing."

                        With Blessings,

                                    Chuck Hillig
