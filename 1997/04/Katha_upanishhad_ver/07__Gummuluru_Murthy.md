But, isn't lethargy a property of the mind only ? Even the buddhi
(the intellect) is not touched by it, let alone the Atman, the Lord of the
chariot.

I define lethargy as the disinclination of the mind to apply to the task
at hand. Body has nothing to do with it and it simply follows. For even
the most "lethargic" person has an active mind. If the buddhi is pure,
the concept of lethargy vainshes.

Thus, I submit that the argument that acceptance of non-volition would
lead to lethargy does not hold.

dear neeta,

your worries are completely understandable.firstly don't be worried. if
your thoughts have taken you sincerely towards god then that is more
than one can hope for in any one life time.the fact that you are at a
crossroads in your life implies only that god has reserved some deeds
for you as yet so as to completely burn out your karma. trust in him, it
may seem hopeless at the moment but if god was to prove his presence to
you then this whole lifetime would be fruitless wouldn't it? i mean
imagine a whodunnit when you know who's done it! as far as your
ancestral and other debts are concerned i think that firstly god would
not be so cheap as to distinguish between man and women considering that
he made both of them; secondly if some of your debts have yet to be paid
out, he will make you pay them out. as the old poem says "ours not to
question why, ours but to do and die". given that realisation cannot
come from volition, the limit of one's volition is to desire
realisation. as the americans say "in god we trust; the rest strictly
cash!"

when your time for the himalayas comes, no power on earth would be able
to stop you; it means god is now ready for you to graduate.

i can't resist americanisms : may the force be with you!

love
