I liked Allan Curry's 'philosophical musings'. A quotation sprang to mind in
respect of what he said. It is from Krishnamenon, and I may have quoted it
before: "Language is the art of concealing thoughts; thoughts are the art of
concealing truth".


A related quotation is also suitable in response to Gummuluru's notes on
pressure: "There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so"
(from Hamlet). Or Swami Chinmayananda said "Mind can make a hell out of
heaven or a heaven out of hell".
