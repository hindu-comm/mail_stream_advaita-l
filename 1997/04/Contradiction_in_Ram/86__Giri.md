        Since Jivo Brahmaiva Na Parah, maybe we can call Brahman illusory
also.

Read brhadAraNyaka and chAndogya upanishads. Traditional Hindu belief
draws equivalences between the human microcosm and the universe. The
various sense faculties are said to go back to their universal sources.
The soul is also described as traveling either the path of the fathers
(pitr-yAna) or the path of the gods (deva-yAna), depending upon
circumstances.

Among the better translations of the upanishads, that should be easily
obtainable in the US are those by S. Radhakrishnan, Patrick Olivelle, and
Swami Prabhavananda.

Nobody knows, but there is no reason to believe that there is some fixed
no. of years. The time period between death and rebirth is not essentially
of any great concern to the texts.
