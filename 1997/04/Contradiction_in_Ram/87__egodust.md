Namaste.

It's worthwhile noting that the teaching of advaita isn't an organized
philosophical system.  Rather it's an adaptable strategy (a means) for the
purpose of diffusing and ultimately destroying the ego-Mind.  Therefore,
depending on the [fluid] approach required/taken, and factoring in the
Mind's own changing dynamics and thereof the temporal countermeasures
needed to "shrink" it, contradictions can [even] be profusely in evidence.
But this is irrelevant.  It's good to remember the old zen saying:
"Don't mistake the moon for the finger pointing to it!"
