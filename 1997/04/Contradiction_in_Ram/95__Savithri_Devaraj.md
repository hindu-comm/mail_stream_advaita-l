Namaste,


Last year, i was attending a workshop on Bhagavad Gita in Arsha Vidya
Gurukulam, Pennsylvania by Swami Viditatmananda Saraswathi.  The
participants asked their doubts about the role of Fate and Free Will.  I
am paraphrasing what he said.  "It is hard to draw a line between Fate
and Free will.  It depends on who you are talking to.  But for
guidelines, you have to assume that you have the sole responsibility to
shape your future through Free will, but see what is past as Fate."
This impressed me.  I thought i'll share this with you all.

Introduction

I have been on this list since last july and enjoyed the postings very
much here.  My sincere appreciations to the maintainers and the
knowledgeable contributors of the list.
I dont have much to say except i have a keen interest in advaita in the
last few years. I enjoy my meditations.  I have read some of Adi
Shankara's works (Geetha Bhashya, Vivekachoodamani), although i cannot
say i understand it all.  I have read a lot of Sri Ramana Maharshi's
books and find perfect bliss in them.  I am 36, married and mother of 3.
I work for a software company in Rockville, MD.

In Peace,
Savithri
