I agree that in some cases, effort is required. As we are aware, in other
cases the awakening happens completely "out of the blue". But even when
effort *is* required, this effort is not the result of choice. The effort
is spontaneous.

It is important to understand that the jeeva is illusory. It never had
volition - it never will have volition.

The Jnani lives no differently to anyone else. The only difference is that
the Jnani *knows* that his or her actions appear spontaneously while the
jeeva still thinks that he or she has choice.
