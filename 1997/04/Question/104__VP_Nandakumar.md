Hi,

        Over the past few days, a few of the members and me, who're new to
Advaita and are really interested in getting started, have requested for some
basic instruction in Advaita. There's hardly been any response to our request.
And this really questions the Goodness attribute of the Brahman, that all of us
are trying to achieve!
