Perhaps the silence is because none of the members of this list is
confident of performing the role of a Guru.

I think a discussion list such as this can only complement, but not take
over the role of an intimate Guru-sishya relationship. Basic teachings
may be obtained from personal reading, but at some point, a Guru is
necessary.

You can make a start by reading translations of upanishads and the
bhAshyas, the published teachings of Gurus like Ramana Maharishi etc. But
always bear in mind that eventually, you will have to get personal,
private instruction from a guru. The list might help in the search, but
it certainly cannot substitute for the place of the Guru.

S. Vidyasankar
