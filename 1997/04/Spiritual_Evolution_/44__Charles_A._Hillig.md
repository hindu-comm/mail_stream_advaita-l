     You're right, of course.  The words "seduction" was entirely
inappropriate, and I thank you for pointing that out.  I didn't mean to
imply that one should satisfy pleasures, lusts, etc..  I was hoping to
suggest that we need to fully align ourselves 100% with what is showing up
for us without resisting our role in the cosmic drama. It was much like what
Krishna was suggesting to Arjuna.  Just do it!

                     With Blessings,

                                    Chuck Hillig
