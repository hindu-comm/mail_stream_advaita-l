I forgot to mention in my previous mail. HH abhinava vidyAtIrtha has said that
it is not incumbent for anyone to marry. In response to a specific question
whether women can also go through life without marrying, HH has replied that
they can do so. Anyone who has enough vairagya need not marry and can become a
sanyasi straight or remain a naishtika brahmachari. HH however has cautioned
that women may face more social pressure in this regard and would have to be
careful about that.

Ramakrishnan.
