Here's my understanding of the subject. If one is fit enough to become an
ascetic, he/she need not "pay" any "debts". Certainly, marrying entails
responsibilities and diverts one's attention. So deciding to be a
brahmachari/brahmacharini is certainly a good idea. But it is also quite
obvious that one should not take it up if one has even the slightest doubt
about such a decision.

Continuing to meditate, etc even after marriage would help I suppose. May be
some of the married members of the list can relate their experiences? I have
noticed that the ones who are spiritually inclined before marriage contiue to
be so even after marriage. So I don't think your fears will come true,
especially since you recognise the possibility, I am sure you'll be wary enough
not to let that happen!

Spiritual evolution is not totally predestined. The final truth is
actionlessness. However if one thinks there is action, then there is also
volition. So, if one thinks that there is something called spiritual
evolution, then it is not totally predestined. This is the understanding we can
get both from our own reasoning and also scriptures like yoga vAsishhTa etc.
After all "fate" is the sum total of past "free-will" and how can fate alone
determine everything? HH chandrashekhara bhAratI has given an extremely lucid
exposition of this in the book "Dialogs with the Guru", collected by Jnanananda
Bharati Swami. Please see if you can obtain this book and read the chapter
"Fate and Free-will". There is also a good discussion of this in the book "The
Jagatguru replies", which is a collection of discussions with HH abhinava
Vidyatirtha. If you need any more info on the books (publishers etc), I can post
them. I think Charles Wikner's first post also stated in a very nice, concise
manner the position of advaitins on this issue.

There seems to be a confusion regarding free-will due to a mix-up between the
states where there is avidyA and there is no avidyA.

Ramakrishnan.
