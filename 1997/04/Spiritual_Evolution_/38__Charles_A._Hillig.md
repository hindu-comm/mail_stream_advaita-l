     There is no way that you can possibly "get lost."   When samsara and
maya show up for you to deal with, (and they always do_) then THAT is your
path.   Then throw yourself into its seductions 100% but don't get attached
to any of it.      The questions you need to address are these:  "Who is the
one who has all of these concerns?  Who is afraid of getting waylaid on
their path to spiritual evolution?  Who thinks that attaining Brahman is
impossible?"

     The thinker and the thought have the same Source.....the Self.

     No need to go to the Himalayas.  You are not "in" a world that also
"has the Himalayas" in it, too.    Being the Self already, the Himalayas are
within you right now.     So, you can marry and also "stay" detachedly in
the marketplace or "go" to the Himalayas and get attached to your cave and
loin cloth.  It's not where you are. It's WHO you are.

     Not getting married and not having children will not prevent you from
getting lost in samsara and maya.  Find out WHO is afraid of getting lost.
You are the Source of the samsara and the maya.

     Spiritual evolution does not occur in linear time.   Pre-destination
vanishes in the now-ness of the Self.   The actions are not yours because
"you" are doing nothing.  The karma is created by your attachment to your
belief that you are the do-er.

     But "you" are not here.  Only the Self is here.  At best, you might say
that "you" are an instrument of ITS expression.

                                         With Blessings,
