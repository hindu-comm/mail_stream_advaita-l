To have a sincere desire to know Brahman is all that is required in kaliyuga.
 That is the spark which lightsup and shows the way.  What was written will
be done.  Any amount of sadhana without sincerety is useless - it just
prolongs the quest.

Regarding the 3 debts, in my opinion,  is meant for those (Jeevas) who feel
obligated.

Continue "Narayana" japam  when you are awake, it goes on by itself when
asleep.

Finally gender has nothing to do with bhakti or grace.
