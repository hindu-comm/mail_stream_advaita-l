I'm sorry if I phrased it wrong. My mind is open. I just wanted to hear more
reasoning about it.

OK, if one's a jnani, totally detatched, can the person really do justice to his
household or kingdom? A true father has to have affection for his children and
family, else cause unhappiness in the family. Likewise the king for his
subjects. OK, one can be detatched in both states. In that case, probably one
will be a true jnani, but can one be a true father or king
too?
