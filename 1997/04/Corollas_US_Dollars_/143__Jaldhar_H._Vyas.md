Nothing wrong with that.  It is no disrespect to ask people to clarify
what they are saying if you don't understand.

You have to distinguish between what is required of a parent or king and
what they commonly do out of false attachment.

For instance in the Ramayana it says when Indrajit was born, Ravana
rearranged the planets to give his son a good horoscope!  What father
wouldn't want to do this if they could?  But as the rest of that story
shows such false attachments even if good intentioned will lead to bad
consequences.  It is enough for a father to make sure his children are
fed, clothed, schooled etc. he doesn't have to satisfy every whim in the
childs mind.  Same with a King. He has to rule wisely and dharmically but
that's it.
