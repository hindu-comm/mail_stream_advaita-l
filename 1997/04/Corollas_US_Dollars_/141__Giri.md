        Since you have already decided that one cannot be a king and a
jnani, what good would Janaka's words and advice do ?

        The reasoning is simple, if one is willing to listen. Detachment
and Attachment is a state of mind. Sanyas is also a state of mind, not of
the body. Not every one who wears an ochre robe is detached. Not everyone
who works is attached.

Namaste.
