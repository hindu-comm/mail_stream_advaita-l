Namaste,
              I agree with Ravi. English words( e.g Soul for Atma) cannot
be substitutes for Samskrita words.In addition these create confusion in
the minds of the readers. So it will be better if Samskrita words are
used in the list. The meanings of such words can be given by learned
members on the list.
                                 Thank you,
                                 Raghavendra.
