Attributing everything to God is indeed a way of getting rid of pride and
the ego, so long as this does not lead to another sort of pride, namely
one by which one assumes to know God's will. As Ramana Maharishi says
somewhere, it is easy to say that one has surrendered everything to God,
but difficult to do it in practice.

All the gurus have assured us that we will indeed realize the deepest,
truest meaning through surrender to God. Of course, true surrender
involves complete dissolution of the ego, so there is no contradiction.

In some ways, yes, but in Self-Realization, there is no more self, so the
selfishness of the goal may be excused! Yajnavalkya's dialogue with
Maitreyi in the brhadAraNyaka upanishad is very apt for your question.
