The Indian view (I use Indian here instead of "Hindu" or "Vedantic because
this view is common to many philosophical traditions.") is that language
is the template for thought.  Words really do represent the essence of
things and more than anything are the origin of thought.  So the idea of
using language is to learn to express things in the most succint and
accurate way.  If you define thought as "the outward tendancy of the mind"
you may be righ but I think there is more to thought than that.

Should we give up on the idea of having police just because a thief might
pretend to be one.  Same with thought.  Just because the faculty of
thought can be used erroneously doesn't mean it should not be used at all.

Some philosophies such as Buddhism express similar doubt as you do but a
Vedantin would answer: of course there can. This is an important
distinction between the two that many people confuse.  The "witness of
thought" is self illuminating.  It simply does not require another source
to be apprehended the way sight requires light, sound requires hearing
etc.

And how did he propose to do that?  Chances are it required some thought.
Of course if you only mean the outward thoughts it makes more sense but
the only people who avoid thought altogether are coma victims.

Why should you infer anything from your experience?  It could have been
the result of your being drunk or feverish or any number of other things.
The very essence of truth is it is objective and constant.  It cannot
depend on any persons experience.  Experience can at best be supporting
evidence for the truth or falsehood of a proposition.  It is _only_
through language and logic we have a framework for independantly
determining the truth.

Yes.  It wasn't the thinking that put them "out" of it but undisciplined,
unrestrained thinking.
