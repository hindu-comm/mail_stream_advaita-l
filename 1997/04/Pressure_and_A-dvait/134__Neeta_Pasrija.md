Why can I not drive a Toyota Corolla, earn US$ and still be detached?  How
would it be easier if I was earning Indian rupees and driving a Maruti?

I don't think anybody has said it is a crime to earn an honest days living
(dollars, pounds, ruppees, or anything else) after having done an honest days
work.

Total detachment is a process. Does not happen overnite.  *May not* even happen
if one renounces the world.  Meanwhile, lets not accept and be a part of the
"RAT RACE" either.

So we didn't come to the US for the "Quest for Knowledge", but one way or
another we all discovered that Brahman quest is the only true quest.

Is the battle outside or inside us???
