   Happiness is a relative term, Sri shankara has told one can't worship
  2 deity at the same time. So we can't claim that I am driving Toyota
  corola and earning US $ still I claim dettached. Which is impossible.

  I am not against US$ or Toyota Corolla, But Just imagine a guy joined
  a new job earning 60k he takes weeks to decide which car to buy. So what
  is that ????, He gets happiness in choosing the best car. So either one
  should be totally dettached or accept this mundane world of "RAT RACE"
  as a part of the culture.

  Attachment to US $ and Honda Toyota drives One to go to US, common
  don't tell it is for the "Quest  for  Knoweledge".
