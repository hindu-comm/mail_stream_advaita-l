I think that this is where an understanding of non-volition is important.

I would very much contend that one can be driving a Toyota and earning US$
and *still* be detached. Such an individual (is there such a thing? forgive
the terminology) would not differentiate between having the Toyota and not
having the Toyota. Because he (or she) would not consider his (or her) self
to have any control over 'events'... no volition... one accepts the
universe as it appears unconditionally... and understands that 'having' or
'not-having' are the different ends of the same piece of string, why is one
'good' and the other 'bad'? Only in the mind world of duality do they
appear separate.
