Namaste!


SOAP-BOX_PHILOSOPHER = ON

The trick of the non-dual taking itself to be a pointer to something else
(which never exists apart from this very pointing) is what is called
thinking. There is no duality apart from the conceptual distance between
thought and the assumed object to which it purports to point to. Language
is a means of spreading this mistake like a virus spreads the flu.

Namaste!
