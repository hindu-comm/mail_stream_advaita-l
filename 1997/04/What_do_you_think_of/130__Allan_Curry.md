Namaste!

It seems to me that when "during deep meditation it is possible to dispel
time" that no past, present or future is seen to appear, but whoever is
saying the above SEES them ALL simultaneously!  If this is *really* true,
may I be the first to ask them, with deep respect, about just a few winning
lottery ticket numbers!   :-)

Namaste!
