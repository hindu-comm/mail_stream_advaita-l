This is hardly a new discussion.  Both sides have had their say on this
many times and no doubt will again.

If you have the courage of your convictions what does it matter if people
disagree or  misunderstand you?  One of the more important functions of
this list in my opinion is to be able to test ones ideas against other
peoples and see if they hold up.  If you're good, mostly they will. If
perhaps they don't you admit your mistake and move on.  Participation is
voluntary so if you don't want to post anymore don't but imo you haven't
given a very good reason.  If you're getting bored maybe you should just
write a "Giri's answers to Frequently Asked Questions on Advaita Vedanta"
and just post that once a month.

I've personally never cared much for this line of thought.  If someone has
questions it is right and proper for them to try and get them resolved.
Even Shankaracharya who we revere almost as a God isn't some infallible
pope.  People need to hear convincing arguments. You don't neccessarily
have to be the one to answer them but you shouldn't tell them they are
wrong to do so.  Such enquiry (Mimamsa in the truest sense of the word) is
holy and meritorious in of itself.  At best they lead to purification of
the mind and the removal of doubt which is the key to the self-knowledge
you describe.
