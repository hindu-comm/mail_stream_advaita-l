        Namaste. Giri, as Swami Vishvarupananda pointed out, your
        posts are extremely valuable to some of us, and I
        request you to continue your posts for the benefit of
        members like me. And indeed, we do look forward to
        quotes from Shankara, Ramana Maharshi, and others - the
        words of these saints are a guiding beacon for us, and they
        help us develop discrimination and reinforce our faith in
        atma vichara/bhakti. I hope you change your mind ;-)
