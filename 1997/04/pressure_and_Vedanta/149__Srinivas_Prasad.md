If realization Or Detachment is possible Being In Mundane world
Toyota, US$ Etc... (I don't want to bring any names), It was
not necessary for Lord Budda to go to Forest by sacrificing his
wealth. He could have done it sitting on his Royal Bed which he
din't. Name any Rishi or Swamiji Realized Sitting in one of
the Shopping complex US or India.

The Gist Is one has to do SADHANA , SADHANA can be done only by
dettachment to this mundane world.
