Greetings.  I am sure Shri Giri put it in a sarcastic way when he
mentioned _advanced_ sadhaka.  I have never regarded myself or wish to be
regarded as "advanced" sadhaka. If my posting gives indication of anything
like that, my apologies.

It was also not my intention to slight the contributions of the great
sages and gurus or anyone. If my posting came out that way (as perceived
by anyone), again my apologies.

My comment simply was "Atman does not travel anywhere and the sages and
gurus know that. Jeeva's death and what happens to jeeva after death are
(in my perspective and I am sure in the sages' perspective as well) are
trivial matter and I wondered whether undue importance was given to it.".
Shri Giri answered the question more than well in the context of approach
to disciples.
