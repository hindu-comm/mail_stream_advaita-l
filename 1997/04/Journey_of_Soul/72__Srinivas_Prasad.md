  Dear friends ,

 1.  What happens to the soul when one leaves the material Body (Death).

 2. Assuming that he/she is going to come back again to this living
    planet, how long it takes in Years to be back in action?????.

 3. In between this state since there is no material body like Brain,
    heart etc.. will the soul remembers it's existance on earth.
    Is it possible for this soul to remember it's good and bad actions
    done. Is it poosible for the soul to repent at that moment about
    the bad deeds??????

    thanx in advance
