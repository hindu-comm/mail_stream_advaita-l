        Certainly not. I most certainly felt that things like journey of
the soul etc. are not required for a person who _understands_ that the
Atman does not reincarnate. Since you are familar with Katha upanishhad
etc., I knew you have atleast studied those scriptures. You are not likely
to ask 'If there is no liberation from rebirths, why practice a "sadhana"
or even uphold moral values ?' This has been asked before on this list.
For them, it is said that though Atman does not take rebirths, the subtle
body takes rebirths and undergoes suffering etc.

        Whatever you may consider yourself does not matter. Even
Tulasidas considered himself a childish babbler, while I consider him to
be the greatest Hindi poet. While I don't consider you to be Tulasidas, I
meant no disrespect or sarcasm when I referred to you as an "advanced"
disciple. You see, for a student in 1st grade, a student in 10th grade is
advanced and regarded as such, even though the latter may look at a
college graduate and consider himself inferior.

        I am sorry if it came out like I was sarcastic. All I meant was
certain people don't require information and theories on creation, journey
of soul etc. while others do, depending on the disciple. Whatever may be
the case, there are grades of disciples, and I can consider you advanced,
even though you may not consider that yourself. I do consider a lot of
list members are more advanced in their "sadhana" than I am.

Again, my apologies, though my intention was never to be sarcastic.

Namaste.
