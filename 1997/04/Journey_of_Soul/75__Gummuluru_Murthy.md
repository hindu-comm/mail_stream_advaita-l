Shri Ramana Maharshhi's answer to the devotees (in the last days before He
discarded his physical body) is apt in this context.

When the devotees expressed anguish at Shri Ramana's impending leaving
them, He answered "Where can I go ? I will always be here" [paraphrased].
That is the Atman that is speaking.

On the other hand, journey of the soul (after leaving the body) is as
irrelevant as which supermarket to go to buy milk. I am surprised, in this
regard, how so many sages spent so much time discussing the journey of the
soul [mentioned in Brahma Sutras, Shri Shankara's writings for e.g.].
