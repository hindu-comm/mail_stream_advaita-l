Hi,

        I've been a member of the Advaita discussion group for a few weeks now
and am afraid I'm just an ignorant novice of the whole concept. I do understand
that the final goal is Self-Realisation or Enlightment. I'm also aware that the
study of the Vedas and Upanishads and the Gita would help in attaining the
goal?(I've not studied any of them!). I'm learning Sanskrit, as I realize that,
without it I would always have rely on the thoughts and ideas of others, rather
than understanding it myself, from the original.

        But is there any specific procedure that one should follow while working
towards the goal? Something like the Gita first, followed by the Upanishads or
something like that?

        I'm quite young and single. At this point of time I'm quite confident
that I can really work towards the goal. But I realize that I must marry sooner
or later. Then, is it really possible to attain the goal if one falls prey to
Samsara? OK, I know that Buddha did it, but not everybody is Buddha!

        I would appreciate if somebody would take the time to give me some basic
instruction.

Dhanyavaad,
Nanda
