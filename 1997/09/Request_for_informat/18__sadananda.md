I suggest you contact Chinmya Mission San Jose.  There is one who used to
teach Vedic chanting with correct intonations.  He is very good.  His
sister is here and she is my Sanskrit teacher, Maragatham.  If you cannot
get hold of him through Chinmaya Mission , I will contact Maragatham and
get you the number.

Hari Om!
