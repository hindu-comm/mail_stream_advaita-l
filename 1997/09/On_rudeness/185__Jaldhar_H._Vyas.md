And since when was being a jnani a requirement for making such simple
judgements?  Some may require more knowledge than I currently posess.
Some may be so complex as to defy any pat answer.  I don't deny that.  But
come on, the capacity for simple logic and moral judgement?  I hardly
think this requires any special talents, certainly not any unique to
myself.

And fear of making the wrong decision cannot be an excuse for avoiding
decisions at all.
