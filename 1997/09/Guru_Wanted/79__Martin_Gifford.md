Hi All !

Sincere thanks to everyone who came up with suggestions for a guru. I was
impressed by the _feelings_ expressed by everyone as advaita can sometimes
seem very dry.

I checked out all suggested websites. So far I'm undecided.

I'm going to see a guy called Sailor Bob in Melbourne. He was supposed to
have been enlightened by Nisargadatta.

I'll let you know if I get enlightened.

Regards,

Martin.
