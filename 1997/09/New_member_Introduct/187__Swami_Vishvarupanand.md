Harih OM!

        This is a request to subscribe me to the Advaita List.
        I have received copies of many messages that were posted on
Advaita-List from Swami Vishwaroopanandaji of our Ashram in Rishikesh
and would now like direct access to them!
        I have been with Omkarananda Ashram in Winterthur (near ZÃ¼rich) in
Switzerland for the past 25 years+, and grew up endeavouring to live the
Advaitic philosophy way of life. I would participate in discussions on
this List to the extent possible, as time from our other Ashram
activities permits.

        Thank you very much and OM OM OM, Swami Vivekananda
