About Me(Brahmachari Durai)

I have undergone the 3-year course in Vedanta conducted by
Swami Dayananda Saraswathi(Founder of Arsha Vidya Pitham
& Arsha Vidya Gurukulam) and I am right now the disciple of
Swami Paramarthananda (disciple of Swami Dayananda Saraswathi).
I am residing with Swami Paramarthananda at Madras, at present.

I have devoted my life to Vedantic and Sanskrit studies and teaching.

I feel very happy that I came to know about the existence of such a list
and I hope my interactions with the list will be a mutuallly enlightening
effort.

Good day!

Truly,
Durai
