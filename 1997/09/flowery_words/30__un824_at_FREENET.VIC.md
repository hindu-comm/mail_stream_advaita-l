Namaste,

Sometimes the poet can give us more of the rose than the botanist and
more truth than the philosopher. I'm not sure how far I've succeeded
but I hope you enjoy the attempt...


        As a stone thrown
        into a well
        can sound the depths --
        we turn back the mind
        into its origin
        and wait breathlessly
        here
        in the endless silence
        of God.


- Allan Curry
