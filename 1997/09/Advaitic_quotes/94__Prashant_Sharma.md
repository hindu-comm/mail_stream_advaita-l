The quote is by a scientist in the pre-quantum era.  When the view point
shared by all the scientists was that the motion of all objects is given
by the known laws of physics (Newton's laws and Maxwell's equations) to
any degree of precision desired.  The only reason statistical physics was
developed was because one couldn't possibly solve the equations for a
large number of particles and hope to obtain from the solution physically
relevant
information, like how the pressure and volume of the system changes
with time.  The view point reflected by this quote is the then prevelant
thought in the back of every scientists mind that perhaps there exists
some "intelligence" which can see through the maze of these large number
of equations, solve them and thus "uniquely" know the "answer" of the
state of the universe for all times to come (the then known laws of
physics only involved linear differential equations => that once initial
conditions are known everything that follows can be uniquely predicted).
        We now understand that all these ideas are wrong, because the true
physics is quantum mechanical in nature and also the equations of motion
are non-linear and therefore there are complications :-) of the kind that
Shri Sadanand points out.
Regards.
Prashant.
