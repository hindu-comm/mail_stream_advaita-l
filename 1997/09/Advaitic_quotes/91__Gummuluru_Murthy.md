I love quotations of advaita also and sometimes use them (for some time)
as part of the signature file.

Some of them are

Moksha is not freedom for the individual. It is freedom from
individuality.
        T.M.P. Mahadevan in "Time and the timeless"

What did not exist at the beginning and what is not going to exist at the
end is as good as non-existent even in the present.
        Translation of a verse by GauDapAda in Mandukya KArika
        Translation by H.K. Iyer in "Advaita"

For (all) incoming knowledge, discipline is the most fundamental.
        Sage Vyasa in Mahabharata (This reads much better in Sanskrit)

becomes immortal, and attains Brahman even here.
