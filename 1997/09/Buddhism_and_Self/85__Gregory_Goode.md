I haven't ecountered non-dualism in Judaism, even in Kabbala.  Mysticism
and esotericism yes, but the metaphysics seem to me to be intransigently
not non-dual...

In the West, there was a reflection of this in the Theosophical movement,
which also began in the 19th century.  All religions would be explained
by Theosophy, which took most of its material from Vedanta.
