I should not be the one to do this, but leave it to the really knowledgable
ones on the list. But I fear most of them would keep silent mainly because
they're above this.

Is this really necessary? The only purpose this kind of talk would serve
is to fuel more arguments.

It's a traditional Hindu thought that Sankara was Shiva's incarnate and
even today it's maintained. This is hardly a responsible statement for
somebody who wants to preserve amity on this list.

However you define it, if Advaitam isn't orthodox Hindu philosophy,
nothing is. In Advaitam, the shruti is considered the final authority and so
discussion on Advaitam would definitely reflect orthodox Hindu thought.
Though I don't remember anybody objecting to anything SENSIBLE,
irrespective of the source.

Does it really matter how anybody defines Advaitam? Truth is Truth,
whatever the definition.

Infact, I was the first to object to Ramakrishnan's objectionable tone in his
postings. But the members should understand that there're quite a few of
us on this list who're very new to this and trying to learn. And if the
contributor's on this list aren't responsible and careful about their
postings, we could easily be misguided. So Ramakrishnan and Jaladhar
even though are a bit 'direct', they serve to keep the list free from
'misguiding' thoughts.
