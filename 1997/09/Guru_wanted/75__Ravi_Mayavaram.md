Thanks for the beautiful post.  In the verse explaining the
guru lakshaNam,

shrotriyo.avR^ijino.akaamahato yo brahmavittamaH .
brahmaNyuparataH shaanto nirindhana ivaanalaH .
ahetuka dayaasindhurbandhuraanamataaM sataam.h .. 33..

"nirindhana iva analaH" is explained as "he is like a
smouldering fire unfed by fuel". What exactly is meant by this simile?
