        That is a very beautiful thought.   It reminds me of the story of
Agastya rishi who is supposed to have attained realization by learning
about life from all life forms (even an ant) and also from inert forms
like a mountain.  The thing to take from all this (or atleast what "I"
seem to have taken from all this) is that knowledge is a mere reflection
of one's being.  There is really nothing that somebody can give you which
you do not already have (if I sound "impractical" I am sorry, but there is
no other way I can express myself better). The desire to have a
guru of a particular form is just another desire and can only lead
someone on to a "search path" which merely distracts attention from the
present.  The present is where life is, everything else exists in the past
or in the future and is a mental construct.   Therefore, really the guru
is within us.
Regards,
Prashant.
