 In his commentary, Shri. Chandrasekhara bharati dicsusses this verse
in two contexts, one quite straight forwardly and another in reference
to or in relation with another quality. let me quote him, and also try
to say what I think HH is referring to. If you see otherwise in HH`s
quotes, kindly point it out.

Begin quote:
 brahmaNyuparataH: One whose mind has found its rest in Brahman. Hence,
one is at peace like a fire without fuel. A fire not fed by fuel is
without flame. It is " sAnta ", contained in itself. So, one who is
withdrawn into Brahman is not attached to any external activity and is
established in the nirguNa Brahman. Hence he is spoken of as "sAntah"
that is, as one who is not affected by kAma etc.

end quote:

 Apart from the straight forward meaning given in as many words by HH,
I see an implied meaning in the last few words when HH says `not affected
by kAma etc.`.  This is because, when explaining the previous words :
"aVrjinaH" (meaning sinless) and "akAmahataH" (meaning one who is not
subjected to kAma, the promptings of desire for external objects) in the
verse, HH says the "brahmavittama", the eminenet knower of Brahman
has direct realisation and enjoyment of the bliss of self realisation.
In accordance with the Gita sloka:
viSayA vinivartante nirAhArasya dehinaH ||
rasavarjam, raso'pyasya param drsHtvA nivarttate ||
Sense objects withdraw from an abstinent person. But the taste for them
may remain. Even this is annulled when the Supreme Brahman is realised.

So a person who has no worldly desire and he is said to be akAmahataH:
that is one who is not hataH (=struck) by kAma. And also, HH equates, kAma
to inducement of sin.

 So I think that HH here says each one of the qualities is summed up
and is also superceded by the statement that he (the Guru) is like:
a fire unfed by fuel. and that (quote) "by their cumulative existence,
they remind one (the disciple) of his nature and are to be considered
as his essential qualities (svarUpa -lakshana). "  (unquote)

Cheers,
Vaidya.
