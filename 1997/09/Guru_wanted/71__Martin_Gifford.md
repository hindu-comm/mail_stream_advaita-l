Hi All !

I thought a guru should appear when there is a need in a seeker. I have the
need but perhaps I'm not ready.

Anyway if someone can suggest a guru that meets the following criteria
please let me know.

_GURU WANTED_

ESSENTIAL CRITERIA:

Must be permanently free of the sense of doership.
Must have fully and finally realised non-duality.
Loving and accepting.
Capable of quickly transforming his/her students.
Must not use guilt.
Keen about ending human violence and suffering.
Must not have an aversion to life in the physical plane.

Regards,

Martin.
