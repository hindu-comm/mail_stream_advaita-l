I had said that the guru "mustn't _use_ guilt". My experience is that the
use of guilt actually increases the self consciousness and sense of
separation in the student. There are much smarter ways of getting a person
to change such as Advaita! I don't think there is a solution to any
spiritual problem within duality. And guilt is within duality.

Then why are you worried about morality? I would say that our interpretation
of the physical plane is illusionary but not the actuality of the physical
plane.

I'm not interested in Vedanta. I heard Vedanta meant "the end of knowledge".
That is what I am interested in.
