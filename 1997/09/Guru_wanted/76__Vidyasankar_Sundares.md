This refers to the jIvanmukta state. When wood or coal is burnt, the fire
eventually reaches a state where all the fuel has been consumed, but the
embers continue to glow for some time. If the embers are stoked and fresh
fuel added, the fire starts up in full fury again. Other similes used
refer to the burnt cloth, in which even after all the threads are burnt,
the residue retains the shape of the cloth till it is disturbed.
