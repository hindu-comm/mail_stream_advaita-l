The atma is not Shunya because atma is the same entity as Brahman.  The
two words are synonyms.

While the Advaitin is not prepared to say much about the nature of Brahman
as in "neti, neti", he can say with confidence Brahman exists.  The
Buddhists are unable or unwilling to even say this much about an ultimate
reality.  This is a big difference.

I don't know if this is true.  If we look at Tibetan Buddhism which is the
nearest in shape and form to what Indian Buddhism was before it became
extinct, it is just as scholastic and rational as any school of  Hinduism.
I don't see how it can be said to appeal to any different temperament.

The bottom line is that Vedanta asserts the existence of one ultimate
reality and Buddhism asserts the existence of none.  It doesn't take any
special knowledge to realize that 1 does not equal 0.
