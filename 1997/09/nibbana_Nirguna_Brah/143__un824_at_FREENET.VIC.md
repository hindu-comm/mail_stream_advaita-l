IMO, the astika shastras would be arguably wrong if they really were
equating buddhist nirvana with nothingness. This leads me to wonder...

What is the epistemological status of the astika shastras?
Is it a tenet of the orthodox faith to believe they are unerring
in their totality? How much can an orthodox follower of vedanta
disagree with explanations and arguments in the astika shastras
without being in trouble? What other parts of the vedic system
are considered to be unerring, which debatable, etc.?

namaste,
