In Vedanta (following Purva mimamsa) the theory is words have intrinsic
meaning and aren't merely descriptions of objects.  (Interestingly this is
another difference with Buddhists like Dignaga who go the opposite extreme
and hold all words are conceptual and have no relation to the objects
they represent.)  So Atma cannot be shunya in the linguistic sense.
