Note that I alluded to this also.  Atma = Brahman, yet if it weren't for the
jiva, the *idea* of atman would be meaningless.  In this *linguistic* sense,
it could be equated to being shunya.  This is the thrust of why Buddha was
silent.  Refer to the post by Prashant Sharma and my reply, below (which is
the gist of the entire point I was trying to make):

Yes, exactly.

Yes, it certainly appears to be the case in all that you're saying.  Buddha
wasn't willing to assert any positive conceptual postulate for a strategic
reason: he was trying to provoke experience as opposed to mentation.
He was called Sakyamuni for this reason.  He did however, reluctantly,
assert that the awakened state was "Bliss, yes Bliss, my friends, is
nirvana."  Hearing such a statement, how can it be concluded that he was
affirming an absolute shunya?  His shunya only applied to the sohamidam.
Moreover, if he refers to nirvana as bliss, doesn't there have to be some
entity in existence to have this bliss?  By inference, mustn't there be a
self present?

Namaste.
