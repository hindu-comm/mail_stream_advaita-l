Ok. I had trouble finding the book I was referring to, so I'll drop the
attempt now!

Yes, but there is the legacy of logical argumentation that all traditions
are burdened with. We can take it or leave it, but little is served by
misrepresenting it. After all is said and done, I'm sure teachers of both
sides will agree with your last statement. After all, the final emphasis
is on knowing the truth, within the depths of one's own being/knowing, not
about quarelling.

I'm not sure how this can be done, or if it will succeed. The world as it
is now, emphasizes an extroversion, while all spiritual paths emphasize
intense introspection.
