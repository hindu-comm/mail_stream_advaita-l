Does my tune or tone require changing?

Caveat: I don't know anymore about Buddhism than is explained and argued
against in the astika shastras.  I have no reason to suspect they
misrepresent Buddhist views but it could be the case.

I believe what the Buddhists mean by Nirvana is the cessation of
everything.  That's not the same as one ultimate reality.  For the
Buddhists the main feature of consciousness is that it only exists from
moment to moment and constantly changes.  So when that consciousness stops
there is nothing.

For Advaita Vedantins what is meant by Brahman is pure consciousness which
_never_ changes.

Any similiarity in language is probably due to the fact the two religions
grew in a common environment.
