OK, I'm not afraid of you...I'll fight you anywhere, anytime!  hahaha!

Seriously, you haven't disproved what I said, if anything you indirectly
supported it.

Also, if you're so settled upon the belief that you or anyone else is a
'mortal,' you're adhering to a pretense.  Self-enquiry should shatter this
myth.  If it doesn't, it's not being honestly applied.  The existence of
the separative jiva thrives as long as it's left uninvestigated.

Who or what is the essence of Ramakrishnan?  or "egodust'?  or anyone?


Namaste.
