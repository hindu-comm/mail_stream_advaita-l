If the eye is sensitive enough, the light revealed in that countenance is
factually beyond brightness.

He has worn vibhuti on occasions, as well as in the latter years sat on a tiger
skin.  These were "forced," as it were, on him by his followers.  He didn't
object because ultimately it didn't matter to him either way.  He wanted also
to set an example for those who relied on such observances, since he sanctioned
*all* paths as suitable to those individuals with [such] corresponding
temperaments.

Namaste
