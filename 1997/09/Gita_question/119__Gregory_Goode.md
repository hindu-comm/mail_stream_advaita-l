I would like the Sanskrit for this verse, if anyone has it handy...

Bhagavad Gita 4.24
-------------

The offering is Brahman, the oblation is Brahman,
poured by Brahman into the fire that is Brahman,
Brahman is to be attained by that man who concentrates
intensely on the action that is Brahman.

   -Oxford University Press, c1994.
   -Trans. by W.J. Johnson

Thanks!  --Greg
