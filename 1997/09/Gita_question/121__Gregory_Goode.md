Thanks!  I've heard some of Ramana Maharshi's devotees say this as a
before-meal offering.  I like the idea, I guess if I want to say this, I'll
say it in English until I learn how to pronounce it correctly!  It has a
nice way for me of concentrating the mind on the fact that what we see,
eat, offer, etc., is Brahman.
