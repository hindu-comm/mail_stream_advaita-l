Sorry for responding so late.
The second version is ITRANS which is widely used on the net as transliteration system for Devanagari, and yes, as Thakur says, it can be converted into Devanagari. There are several ways to do that which you can find at ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/private/sanskrit/sanskrit.html. You can also download a free utility for converting ITRANS to Devanagari from http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/5105/Itrans.htm

Om Om Om

Thank you.  What is the difference between the two?

Raghavendra's from 19 September, 1997:

>  BrahmaarpaNam Brahma Havi-rBrahmAgnou BrahmaNA Hutam-h  |
>  Brahmaiva tena gantavyam Brahmakarma-SamAdhinA ||


and yours:

>OM brahmaarpaNaM brahmahavirbrahmAgnau brahmaNAhutam.h |
>brahmaiva tena gantavyaM brahmakarma samAdhinA ||
