There is a place called Vaidheeswaran Kovil in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.
Lord of the temple is Vaideeshwarar, also known as vaidyanaatha.  That
may be the reason why the name Vaidyanathan is common among aiyars. In
fact that name is very common in our family line as shrii vaideeshwara
is our family deity.
