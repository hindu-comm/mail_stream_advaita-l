     About Nagnath: There are three claims to the jyotirlinga called Nagesh.
    One is about 64 kms. from Nanded in Maharashtra. This jyotirlinga at Aundh
    is claimed to be the aadya (the first) of the 12 jyotirlingas.
    The second claim to the naagesha title is at a place about 27 kms. northeast
    of Almora in Uttar Pradesh. This linga is also called Yaagesh or Jaageshvar.
    Another linga, perhaps in Gujarat, is also called naagesh. Details on this
    linga are scarce.

Harih Om,

There is one Lingam in Thirunageshwaram, Tamil Nadu, which is said to be a Jyotirlinga. It is situated in the Temple where also the shrine of Rahu, one of the famous nine Graha temples in the area, is. Do you know whether this is another claim to this same Jyotirlingam?

Greetiings, Om
Vishvarupananda
