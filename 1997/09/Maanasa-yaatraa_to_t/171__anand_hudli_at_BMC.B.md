  About Nagnath: There are three claims to the jyotirlinga called Nagesh.
  One is about 64 kms. from Nanded in Maharashtra. This jyotirlinga at Aundh
  is claimed to be the aadya (the first) of the 12 jyotirlingas.
  The second claim to the naagesha title is at a place about 27 kms. northeast
  of Almora in Uttar Pradesh. This linga is also called Yaagesh or Jaageshvar.
  Another linga, perhaps in Gujarat, is also called naagesh. Details on this
  linga are scarce.
