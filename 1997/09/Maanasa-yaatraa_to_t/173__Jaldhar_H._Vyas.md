Again according to the Kotirudra Samhita of the Shiva Mahapurana, this
Jyotirlinga is in the forest called Darukavan.  I don't know where this
is supposed to be located.  It could be in Gujarat because Gujarat is
technically in the "South" (The Vindhyas being the line of demarcation.)
On the way to Somanath I remember we stopped at a Nageshwar Mahadeva but I
don't remember there being anything really special about it.
