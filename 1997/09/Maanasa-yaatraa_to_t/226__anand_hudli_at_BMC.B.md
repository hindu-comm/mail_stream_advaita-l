 I praise Shiva known as Lord Kedaara, the One without a second, who
 sports on the banks of Mandaakinii, near the Himalayas, and who is ever
 worshipped by the foremost of the sages, the gods and demons, and even by
 the Yakshas, the great serpents (such as Vaasuki), and other beings.

 About Kedarnath: This is one of the most important shrines of Hinduism.
 The deity of the temple, Shiva is said to have assumed the form of the
 rump of a bull. He is said to have done so in order to elude the PaaNDavas
 who approached Him so that they could wash away their sins committed due to
 the killing of their cousins, the Kauravas, and other relatives in the battle
 of Kurukshhetra.

 At the entrance to the temple is a statue of nandi, the Divine Bull and the
 vehicle of Shiva. The temple is home to the jyotirlinga, recognized as one
 of the sacred 12 such lingas.

 Kedarnath is about 240 kms. from Haridwar and about 212 kms. from Rishikesh.
