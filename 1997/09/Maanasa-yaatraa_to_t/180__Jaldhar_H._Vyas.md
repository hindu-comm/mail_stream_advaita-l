Thanks for the info.  If you're familiar with the area, is there a
Vaidyanath Mahadev there?

Then I have no problem with it.  My objection is to the suggestion that
all four are valid definitions of Advaita.

You're perfectly right.  These other definitions of Advaita are in wide
use.  But a thing doesn't become true just because a lot of people think
it should be.

I also think you're right that those type of views are spreading widely.
But I think there is movement in the opposite direction too.  If my Father
had wanted to study when he emigrated to the West in the '60s it would
have been impossible.  For me it was rather difficult.  I'm confident that
my future children will be able to get an education that will make them
the equal of anyone in India.  More educated traditionalists will make it
harder on the sillier claims.  It's been my observation that most of the
foreigners actually have a very superficial interest in Vedanta.  They are
are attracted by its exotic nature.  Will they still be interested when
its the religion of doctors, and lawyers, and computer programmers instead
of mystical sages of the East?  It's much easier to believe in aliens
riding comets or Egyptian Pharoahs reincarnating in middle-aged
housewives.  At least Pharoahs don't argue or insist on logic and morality! :-)
