Ganesha chaturthi (known in Tamil Nadu as piLLaiyaar chaturthi) is
celebrated on shukla paksham chaturthi  of bhaadrapaada month ( 4th day
of the bright half ). According to some traditions, the chaturthi thithi
should be there at 12:00 noon of day of celebration. Hence Ganesha
chaturthi is celebrated (by some) on 6th September 1997 (Saturday). But
some other traditions celebrate it on 5th as well.

If someone is interested in doing the complete puuja , Hindu Puja &
Bhajan Home Page has a beautiful document for that. It can be obtained
from
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/8891/ganesha.ps  or
in text format
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/8891/ganesha.txt

Even if all the items are not available in the place one is staying, one
can do the puuja with available facilities and do the rest in a
maanasika style. The text maintained in the Hindu Puja & Bhajan Home
Page is very elaborate and complete.

With respects
Ravi
