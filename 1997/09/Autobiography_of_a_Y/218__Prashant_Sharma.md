        I happened to talk to a relative of "Lahiri Mahasaya" who was a
Professor of Chemistry (until he retired some 20 years ago) at Banaras
Hindu University.  He told me that even though the book doesn't say
anything wrong (a very general comment) one should beware of taking it too
literally as it has been written with the intent of making it sell.

Prashant.
