I think I remember reading the same thing about Govinda and Babaji in
the AUTOBIOGRAPHY text.

I've seen photographs of Babaji!  He's still alive.  There is an ashram of
Babaji devotees in California.  It's called Haidakundi Universal Ashram in
my vague memory.  They advertise the On Namah Shivaya bracelets in Hinduism
Today.  You can purchase Babaji photos for your altar.

I have Sri Yukteswar's SCIENCE OF RELIGION (title from memory), which argues
for a different mathematical calculation of yugas.  I think as he sees it,
all time periods come out shorter than on the conventional view.
Anyone have any info?
