I just ran across an example yesterday of an edit that removed someone's
name who Yogananda had dealt with, which resulted in a false statement,
according to one writer.  I can write up the details tomorrow if anyone
is interested.  I'd heard of other edits too that end up giving an
erroneous impression.  There are other teachers of kriya yoga who are
critical of Yogananda's approach, and count themselves as the true
followers of Lahiri Mahasaya.  I'd seen such critical material in
one of their books.
