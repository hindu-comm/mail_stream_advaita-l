To explain the comparison to the quantum field refer the
following,from the book "The Tao of Physics" by Fritjof Capra.;

"The same idea about mater is conveyed, for example, to the Hindu by the
cosmic dance of the god Shiva as to the physicist by certain aspects of
quantum field theory. Both the dancing god and the physical theory are
creations of the mind: models to explain their authors' intuition of
reality."

Nobody can *know* reality as Sankara says in "Vivekachudamani"
"The Suprema Self is self-efulgent with manifold powers, incapable of
being known by anyone, and yet experienced by everyone as "I-I" in ;the heart."

>From a translation by Ramana Maharshi in the book "The Collected Works of
Ramana Majarshi by Arthur Osborne

I meant no disrespect to Mr. Prashant. I am only trying to show that the Idea
of Oneness and of nothingness are only mental and both Ideas are common to
Advaitists, Bhuddists and Physicists.

Be Joyously Awake! :)

Re: The Riddle of Fate and Free-will

        Yesterday, I saw this beautiful statement on a bulletin board:
" Every morning in Africa a Gazelle wakes up. It knows it must run
faster than the fastest Lion or it will be killed. Every morning a Lion
wakes up, it knows that it must outrun the slowest Gazelle or it will
starve to death. It doesn't matter whether you are a Lion or a Gazelle;
when the sun comes up you had better be running!!!" The Upanishads has a
quotation in a condensed form: "Life is a bridge; enjoy while crossing
but don't build a castle on it!"  The riddle of fate and freewill will
begin immediately when mind starts building the castle! As long as the
illusionary castle stays in the mind, the riddle of fate and freewill
will continue to exist. If and when we realize the full Truth of Life,
identity and consequently fate and freewill will disappear.
        According to oxford dictionary, the word "contemplation" means a long
and thoughtful observation.  We can see why Ramana Maharishi never gave
verbal replies to questions that required contemplation! The great sages
have understood that a moment of silence is more than million words.
They have also understood that no satisfactory answers can ever be found
from outside sources.
