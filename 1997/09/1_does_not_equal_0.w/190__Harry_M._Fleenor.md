Sankara doesn't put the Ultimate
into or ideas words such as 1 or 0.
Both ideas are wrong.
Ideas or words cannot express That.
It is not one and not un-one.
Or It is not zero and not un-zero.
Is the Quantum field zero or all?
both are ideas and not the Quantum field itself.

But again these are only conditional expressions
of the unexpressable.
The pithy saying "I am That" is not ultimate reality
only a finger pointing.
All the arguments fade to nothing
with the experience of Being.
