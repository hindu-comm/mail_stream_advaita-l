Hari Om!

In Sri Swami Sivanandaji's essay on Buddhism, he says, "The word 'Nirvana'
literally means 'going out'. It signifies a spiritual experience full of
peace and bliss, which is characterized by the 'going out' from the heart
of the three fires of lust, ill-will and dullness.  Nirvana is not utter
annihilation. Nirvana is total extinction of all that is base in us."

The Buddhist scholars may not agree with this but I just thought I will
share Swamiji's viewpoint with the seekers on this list.

Om Shanti!
