Agreed.

Is there a Quantum Field itself?  I do not think so.  As a practicing
theoretical physicist aware of the way the ideas of field theory have
evolved I do not think that there is anything besides the "idea" here.
I wonder what you mean by saying that there is a quantum field by itself.

If there is an experience of this "Being" then surely one can form an idea
to represent that experience.  If realization is just another experience
then what you are saying is to modify "I am That" to "I am That
experience" would be a correct statement. On the other hand the saying "I
am that" is not saying that "I am That thing" (my opinion).
