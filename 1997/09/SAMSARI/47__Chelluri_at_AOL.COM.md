NAMASTE!

I am begining to think that what Sri Gummuluri and Sada expounded may be
correct. I have not madeup mind yet.   Waiting for the time.

I will tell why I came to this..

There is a man in Bhimili A.P (they call him Guru).  He came to visit U.S.A.
 His daughter  lives here.  He came here with several other rich people in
India (in Indian Standards).     I came to know about him thru a friend who
knows my buddy who is professor in Andhra University.   My wife visited him
in Bhimili when she went to Vizag this past May.  This Guru has a diciple
whom I contacted.  He is a very nice man and  very devoted Shiva Bhakta.
  Whatever he (diciple)  told me came to pass . You know I am still a samsari
and have questions about children and my future, like many of you do.

I am going to India to perform my 12th Chandi Homam in November and at that
time I want to go visit the Guru.   The Guru himself came here and he
supposed to visit Chicago area next week.   I am hoping to meet him either in
Rama temple or Balaji Temple.   If I meet him (I hope I will) I will post so
you all will know.

What is right i.e., Samsari or Brahmachari.


Shubham                                                           Nageswar
