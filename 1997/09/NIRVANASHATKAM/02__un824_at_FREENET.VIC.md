What I was trying to say was that any "Atman" that can be thought about
is a concept. As long as we cling to concepts *about* Atman, we are still
dealing with fiction.  What is the  case in the abscence of thought is my
real concern here and (IMO) it just does not matter how anybody likes to
think *about* that. It only matters that it is directly realized
(without the mediation of thoughts about it).
