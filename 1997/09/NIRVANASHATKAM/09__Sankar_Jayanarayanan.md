This is a bad (mis)interpretation of Buddha. The Buddhist philosophy which
begins with Buddha and proceeds through Nagarjuna and others is *not* an
ontological thesis, but rather a linguistic philosophy. The "void" in
Nagarjuna's writings refer not to a "reality" (as Nagarjuna himself says,
"If one believes these writings to refer to a treatise on reality, he's lost").
The main thesis of Nagarjuna is that the words that we use are *void* of
meaning.

According to Nagarjuna, there are two truths: the vyavahAra and the paramArtha.
Words like "This horse is grazing here" makes sense at the conventional level,
but at the ultimate level, it makes absolutely no sense. Nagarjuna says,"Those
who do not understand the distinction between the two truths, do not understand
the profundity of the Buddha's message."

This is the heart of Nagarjuna's interpretation of Buddha's silence:
that reality cannot be described.

Any way to describe it only results in nonsense.

As Karl Jaspers says in the chapter "Nagarjuna" in his book "The Great
Philosophers" : "The search is for a geniune truth which is beyond the
scope of words."

Richard King says,"Shunyavada is not the correct way to describe this
philosophy, unless it is used to mean that 'All doctrines are Empty' ."
(In the best book on the KArika, "Early advaita Vedanta and Buddhism").

Not true of the mADUkya kArikA. There are several passages where the claim is
made that people "cover THAT up" by saying things like "sat" "asat" "sadasat"
and "asadasat."

That is far from being clear. There is nothing whatsoever in the KArikA that
can establish the above claim. And there is way too much to the contrary.

Kalupahana tries to Bring out a "new interpretation" of Nagarjuna by presenting
ideas that don't seem correct. He is correct in saying that Nagarjuna's thesis
is that "All this is empty," but incorrect in not observing that the "this" in
the sentence refers to the philosophy of emptiness itself (that no philosophy
can describe reality), which is what Cheng says in his book "Empty Logic" which
I think is a better book on Nagarjuna.

Which is so very nearly similar to Nagarjuna's own words, which is
"samsAra is nirvANa and nirvANa is samsAra...between the extremities of
samsAra and nirvANa, not the subtlest difference is evident."

What Nagarjuna wanted to say was that seeing differences, (seeing duality)
is not reality.
