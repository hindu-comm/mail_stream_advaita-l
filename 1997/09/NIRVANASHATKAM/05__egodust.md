True enough, yet it also asserts "no liberation, no-one to be liberated,"
which suggests the *idea* concerning atman can itself be self-defeating if
it is adhered to as a concept vs the actual spirit of the thing [atmanishta].

It's well known that he sanctioned the state of nirvana.  Obviously there
has to be someone or something as a backdrop to [or substratum of] this state,
or why is it thus named?  Shunyata (tantamount to nihilism) applies only to
the modifications within the changeable mind that need to be diffused in order
to realize or enter into nirvana [which is only a void relative to cognition].
Thus, who or what is in nirvana?  This should lead one to believe that--
semantics and lexicologies aside--the esoteric intent of his teaching is
equivalent to advaita.

Nisargadatta could be interpreted at times to be *off* the "asti" bandwagon,
yet the spirit of his teaching is unmistakably on it.  This is why it's
important to catch the intent implied rather than allow words to perhaps
mislead.

Only on this one point [viz. the existence of the atman] to my knowledge,
in his Karika (IV.99).  And didn't his refutation have more to do with the
resurgence of vedic philosophy (culminating with Sankara) in the face of
the revolution of Buddhism at the time (i.e. he was necessarily polarizing
Vedanta and Buddhism for the purpose to reestablish the sanatana dharma)?
Anyway, being a jnani isn't a guarantee their relative knowledge is flawless.

Namaste.
