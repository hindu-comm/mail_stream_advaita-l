Atman - _not_ a concept. What you state is the viGYAnavAdi position,
which says that the cognizer, cognized and cognition are all
modifications of the intellect, which is momentary and unreal. However,
shrI sha.nkara shows clearly in the upadeshasAhasrI that this leads to
regressus ad infinitum, which is solved only if a real cognizer is
allowed. He points out the fact that the intellect is unreal must be
known by someone and cannot be the intellect itself. A lamp does not
illuminate itself, he says. Other pUrvapaxa views are also stated and
refuted. However, the cognized and cognition are indeed the
modifications of the intellect and appear to be sentient (though not so)
since they are pervaded by Atman (by means of reflection only). This has
also been clearly shown by shrI sha.nkara in his chapter on dream and
memory, svapnasmR^itiprakaraNam (can't recall the chapter number now).

ekAtmapratyayasAram says the mANDUkya. shrI sha.nkara in his terse
commentary gives two interpretations, one being that the valid proof of
the existence of the Atman is the fact that it persists in all three
states.

shrI sureshvara also points out in his naishhkarmya siddhi that Atman
alone requires no proof or pramANa.

The rest are indeed concepts, but serve as an explanation for those who
believe in causality.

Taking up a position implies conceptual thought.
