Re: list of books from Amazon -

Swami Gambhirananda's translations are quite good. Trevor Leggett is
also a very rigorous translator, and brings a very catholic outlook to
his work. He has studied yoga and Zen from accomplished masters of both
traditions.

You won't get much philosophy out of William Cenkner's book. I didn't know
it had been republished in 1995. The 1983 edition had many factual errors.
Hope he has corrected them in the new edition.
