OK, so let's assume Eckhardt's writings and realization are "acceptable" in
that they do not contradict vedas. Let's also assume Eckhardt had no access
to written copies of the vedas and he made no mention of anything literally
identifiable with them. We then seem to have the situation where the
essential universal truth was directly realized outside of literal contact
with the vedas. So, part of my original question remains to be answered,
which was...

>>If the essential universal truth can be directly realized outside of

If the vedas are maintained to be "the only source by which Atman = Brahman
is known" (and Eckhardt's realization is "acceptable" in that it does not
contradict the vedas) then in what way were the vedas the source of
Eckhardt's realization?
