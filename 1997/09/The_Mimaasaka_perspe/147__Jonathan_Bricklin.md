My understanding is that the Buddhists that Kumarila had to contend with
(like many practicing Buddhists today)  based their arguments on perception
and reason only, without recourse to scriptural authority.  Insofar as the
Vedas supported their perceptions and their reasonings they would be
considered valid.    If that is true, then the fact that they saw the Vedas
as products of human beings would not, in itself, render it invalid.  Just
the opposite in fact.
