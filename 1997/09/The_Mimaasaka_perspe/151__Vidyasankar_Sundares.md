vAk should be seen in a general sense, and is not restricted to the
Sanskrit language. For that matter, Skt grammarians distinguish between
the language of the vedas (called chandas) and classical Sanskrit of
literature (bhAshA).

I'm not sure what the traditional take on this would be, but the mImAmsA
interpretations spend a great deal of attention to language, so there just
might be some leads in their texts. More simply, the thumb rule regarding
smrti can be followed. The words of smrti are accepted as valid if they do
not contradict the Sruti (vedas). In practice, this gives enormous
flexibility for various traditions, even within Indian communities. So,
someone like Plotinus or Eckhardt would be seen as not contradicting the
vedas, and therefore acceptable. As you may be aware, people like
Radhakrishnan have already pointed out the similarities.
