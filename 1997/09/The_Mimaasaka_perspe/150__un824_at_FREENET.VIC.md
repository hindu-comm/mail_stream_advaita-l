Namaste,

Medeival Christian mystics had no access to Sanskrit works but seemed to
have direct access to their primordial oneness with the ground of being.
They made no mention of "vAk/sarasvatI, the Goddess of speech/learning",
neither did they  say their revelation contradicted "vAk" for the simple
reason "vAk" did not exist *for them* at that time in Europe.  If the vedas
existed during the lifetime of Meister Eckhardt but he failed to mention
them, must we therefore conclude his "realisation" was bogus?  If he spoke
of similar things but used Latin or German names drawn from a different
tradition, are these considered to be "vedic" because of the similarity?
To put it more simply, is everything true ipso facto "vedic" or is
everything not literally found in the vedas ipso facto not "the truth"?

namaste,
