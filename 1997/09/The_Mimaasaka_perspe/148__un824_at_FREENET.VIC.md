What about the direct realization of many mystics who lived during times
when they could not have encountered the vedas?  Is it the orthodox view of
Advaita Vedanta that these people must have been mistaken simply because
they had not heard the vedas?

If the essential universal truth can be directly realized outside of
contact with the vedas then how can the vedas be considered to be "the only
source by which Atman = brahman is known"?
