The Purva Mimamsa darshan is mainly concerned with exegesis of the Vedas.
Kumarila Bhatta wa the greatest of Mimamsaks.  The Buddhist argument was
that the Vedas were invalid as a true means of knowledge being the
product of human beings and the rules therein were not compulsory and
Kumarila did much to topple their arguments.  His major work is called
Shlokavartika.
