It's true that the final objective is the Truth. Various paths exist to attain
this objective. But one has to accept that there exists conceptual
differences amongst these schools, however subtle they may be. So is it
really advisable to jumble up the thoughts of various schools and try to
make some sense of it? Doesn't this widen the scope for confusion and
misinterpretation? Wouldn't it be practical to follow one school of thought
sincerely, to avoid such confusion?

Probably at a higher level of spiritual development, it's can be practiced.
When Aristotle says, 'the mark of an educated mind is to entertain a
thought without accepting it', I understand but am wary of practicing it!
