Ravi:

It's a rainy Monday morning, I've just arrived at my workplace, and this
post of yours is one of the first things I see.  This is a wonderful
reminder of where we need to keep ourselves focused always.  Thanks for
your thoughts.  This is the best service that such an e-mail list can
provide -- practical assistance to each other in actually REALIZING the
truth, while also providing the opportunity to discuss these matters.
I've heard that Sathya Sai Baba once responded to a question about
whether we have free will or not by saying something like "No, you dont,
but you must act as if you do."  I don't know if he really said it, but
that's always struck me as an apt way to think about the matter.

Love to all.
