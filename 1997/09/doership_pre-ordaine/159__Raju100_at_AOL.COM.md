Let me take this opportunity to request Shri. Ramakrishnan to join back
the List and continue his  contribution to the society.  The issues
raised regarding his postings are delicate. The postings on this subject
matter indicates that he has many friends and admirers.
Shri.Ramakrishnan has demonstrated through his postings that he is  an
intelligent and knowledgeable person on Hindu Scriptures.   I am
confident that he will change his writing style and he will focus on the
issues. I don't believe that he is likely to hurt the feelings of his
friends and well wishers in his future postings.   Diamonds  become
valuable only after they are cut appropriately.  It is equally true that
we need to polish our writing style for more effective communication of
our ideas.   We do not have the wisdom to understand the value of uncut
diamonds and unpolished expressions.
        Religion begins where Science ends.  Scientific facts can be logically
tested and either can be rejected or accepted.  There are no logical way
of testing religious viewpoints and we can neither accept nor reject
them.  I do not believe that we can logically convince others to accept
our viewpoints.  Instead, we should try to find a common ground to
coexist as friends.   We can use this forum to reduce inner conflicts
and maintain inner peace.   It is an interesting fact that almost all
religions stress the importance of  the elimination "EGO."    Ten simple
reminders for ego-centered behavior are classified below.  If we take
steps to avoid these ten EGOs, our postings in Advaita-L will become
free from questionable and objectionable style of expressions.

EGO 1:  Emotion - Grief - Overreaction (Perceive emotions from sensory
perceptions that cause grief and reckless actions).

EGO 2:  Exploitation - Greed - Oppression (Direct greedy actions that
oppresses and exploits others)

EGO 3:  Exaggeration - Gimmick - Opportunism (Gain personal profits
through gimmicks and exaggeration of facts)

EGO 4:  Expectation - Glory - Ornamental (Conduct useless actions that
are Glamorous and for personal glory).

EGO 5:  Externalization - Grumble - Opinionated (Accuse others of one's
mistakes, complain and unduly adhering to one's own preconceived
notions).

EGO 6:  Embarrassment - Guilt - Oscillation (Develop unsteady mind filled
with guilt generated from disputed beliefs).

EGO 7:  Extremism - Grudge - Opposition (Express extreme views and
animosity and organize hostile actions).

EGO 8:  Empty-headed - Guesswork - Obnoxious (Exhibit irritating behavior
attributed to ignorance and preconceived notions)

EGO 9:  Enrage - Goof - Offensive (Use offensive language with an
outburst of anger)

EGO 10: Enmity - Gloomy - Obstruction (With gloomy face, show animosity
and obstruct without valid reasons)

         Hindu Dharma carefully defines the limitations of human behavior with
respect to judging others:    " . . . And another  rule  of  Dharma  is
to  refrain from criticizing or  condemning the  Dharma  of  another man
less developed than yourself.  He is  not looking through your eyes.  He
may be living nearer to his spiritual ideal than your are to yours --
how dare you judge him? Are you so  near  perfect  that  you  set your
standard up as absolute?"  (Yogi Ramacharaka in the book on Advance
Course in Yogi Philosophy and Oriental Occultism.)
         Finally let me conclude my viewpoints with a quotation from  Mahatma
Gandhi - " The only change that the world need is YOU!" Let use
sincerely try to change for the better.

The Sanskrit for that is :
  BrahmaarpaNam Brahma Havi-rBrahmAgnou BrahmaNA Hutam-h  |
  Brahmaiva tena gantavyam Brahmakarma-SamAdhinA ||
( Sorry- I do not know the transliteration)

Here is the proper ITRANS text:

OM brahmaarpaNaM brahmahavirbrahmAgnau brahmaNAhutam.h |
brahmaiva tena gantavyaM brahmakarma samAdhinA ||

Om

Ravi's summary of the statement from Swami Viditatmananda Saraswathi is
an excellent framework to understand and appreciate destiny and
freewill. The quotation,"A man's character is his own destiny," by the
Greek philospher Heraclitus (535 to 475 B.C.) beautifully condenses the
same point of view!
