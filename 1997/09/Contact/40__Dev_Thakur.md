 I'm not expert, but such little things are never important in meditation.
In my impression, all that is necessary for isolation is quiet, isolation,
relaxation, and concentration.  If something is to be chanted, it does not
matter what.  The position of limbs and extremities should not matter either
as long as you are comfortable and can keep from fidgeting.
