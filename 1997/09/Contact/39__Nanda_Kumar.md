I hope I'm not asking a trivial question here. Anyway here it is.

When doing meditation, in whatever position, is it necessary to touch
your thumb with the finger next to the little finger? Somebody once told
me that some sort of energy is created by this contact! Another day I
saw on TV that only the primates can do this!

If this is insignificant, just forget it!!!
