It is customary, when counting the number of times one chants a mantra,
to start on the middle knuckle of the ring finger, and count to ten in a
cyclic fashion. Human beings have opposable thumbs, which makes it
possible for the thumb to touch all knuckles on all fingers. Other
primates do not have opposable thumbs. However, talk of some energy being
created by this contact is not very useful. Nothing happens really, by
such physical means. It is the mind that needs to be trained.
