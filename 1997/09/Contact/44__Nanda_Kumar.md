I'm posting this on behalf of Udhay Thatte, though a list member, seems to
have a problem posting his mails.

Anybody who has practiced 'Yogasana's will appreciate the importance
of
body postures and limb positions for achieving maximum mental
efficiency. Although it is easily discarded by advocates of 'mind over
matter' such as Deepak Chopra et al. which is definitely valid beyond a
certain level, there is a very important use of it.

Basically yogasanas and yogamudras are simply about stimulating
specific
glands and controlling their functioning. Even the chinese practices of
acupuncture and acupressure are on similar lines. After all, thinking is
nothing but an electro-chemical process and increased secretion of
certain enzymes can definitely enhance the functioning of brain (as
alchohol, nicotine or some other substances can have a powerful effect
on your thinking ability - either positive or negative is a matter of
debate!!).

I feel that although these gestures seem hardly important from a
philosophical point of view, they have gained importance simply because
the mind is a part of the body and it is great to improve the
functioning of the mind which is the tool for any Sadhana. Whether you
achieve anything philophically or not is a different matter.

Uday
