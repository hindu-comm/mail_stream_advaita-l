Namaste,


"[...] Therefore he seeks to find and regain his own nature, i.e., his
Self. That found, all is found.

Such inward seeking is the path to be gained by man's intellect. The
intellect itself realises after continuous practice that it is enabled by
some Higher Power to function. It cannot itself reach that Power. So it
ceases to function after a certain stage. When it thus ceases to function
the Supreme Power is still left there all alone. That is Realisation; that
is the finality; that is the goal.

It is thus plain that the purpose of the intellect is to realise its own
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
dependence upon the Higher Power and its inability to reach the same. So it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
must annihilate itself before the goal is gained."
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
