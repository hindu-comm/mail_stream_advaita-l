I have known Rama for quite some time through emails, and have had the chance
to meet him too. I completely agree with Sista: Rama's words may sound harsh,
but he really does not mean to hurt anyone.

Moreover, his contributions to the advaita-l list in terms of substance is
far more than anyone else.

It's not right to bar such a person from this list.
