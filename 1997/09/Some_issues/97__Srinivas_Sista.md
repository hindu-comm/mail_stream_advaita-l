I would like to take the liberty of expressing my feeling about the
language occasionally used by Ramakrishnan Balasubramaniam (Rama).
I was a room mate of Rama for the past 3 years. I am sure people
who know him personally agree with me that he has a unique way of
expressing his opinions. He is not the one who goes for euphemisms,
politeness or even being silent at the expense of diluting or
misrepresenting the content. I can understand that the list members
do not have any idea regarding the humorous/jovial side of Rama and
his insistence on the `no nonsense' approach. So it is very easy for
people who dont know him to construe that he is being rude when he
OCCASIONALLY expresses certain opinions in the way he does. He is not
the kind of person who wants to hurt others verbally.

I personally feel that a person should be able to separate the content
from structure for any intelligent debate to occur. Especially in a list
like the current one, where we are not only exploring the knowledge
passed on by the great teachers, but also our own personal stupidities,
narrowness and prejudices. Also it is worthwhile to do some self
examination to separate out the ego based reactions when evaluating
the statements made by others; to examine the hidden assumptions we
make in deciding what we think the other person is saying.

Asking Rama not to join the list will only be a loss to the list. So
if my opinion matters, it is not a wise decision to ask Rama to
withdraw from the list if he wants to join.

with sincere regards,
Srinivas Sista.
