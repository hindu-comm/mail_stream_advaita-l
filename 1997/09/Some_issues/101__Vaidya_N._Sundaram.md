namaste.

I was listening to an audio casette of the disourses given by His Holiness
Shri Chandrasekarendra Sarastwati, the previous head of the Kanchi madam.
Let me briefly repeata portionB here as I feel it is relevant.

The cause of all suffering,ill-will and hatred in this world is because
of EGO. for example, consider throwing a ball. If there is nothing in
front of you when you throw the ball the ball keeps going and we feel
nothing or joy. We then try to throw it faster and further away. Now, all
of a sudden there is a big wall in front of us. The wall merely reflects
the ball back at us; for that is its nature. it does nothing. All it did
was stop the ball we threw, and the force of our throw has resulted in the
ball bouncing back at us. Similarly, our ego is the ball. the mind throws
it and whenever it is stopped, the ego is sent flying back at us. What we
perceive as being the work of another and imagined attack is merely
our own ego coming back. The moment we give up trying to throw balls,
no matter how many walls there are, no ball comes flying at us to bother
us. So we should all try to shed the ego ....

 I am really amazed that with such a simple example, HH has been able to
convey so clearly and so eloquently a fundamental thought that troubles
every born entity. If only we could all be like that ...!!

 On the issue of language used in the postings by Rama, I fully agree with
Srinivas Sista. Having been here and interacted with Rama, I do think that
it is just his way of doing things and he holds nothing against anybody.


Cheers,
Vaidya.
