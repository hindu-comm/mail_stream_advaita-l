Seems to me there must be a standard or there is no standard by default.

I most emphatically object to anyone being allowed to take cheap
shots on this list, for any reason whatsoever, not the least of which being
because that person also tows the "party line". If you want this list to
resemble the rest of the internet then don't moderate it. In six weeks
it won't be worth reading.

If anyone calls anyone else insulting names, impugns their intelligence,
etc., etc., then you allow a "free for all" or you kick them out (after
repeated warnings from the moderator). You can't have it both ways, can
you?  If it's such a good thing to be insulted then why should we not all
be allowed to extend this "gift" to whomever and whenever we choose on this
list? That may not be what you want but that's what you'll get if you don't
moderate the list in a meaningful way. For instance, I doubt you all would
like to hear what I *really* think of people who give "high-minded" advice.

Some people offered personal testimonials to the intrinsic goodness of R.
I'm quite convinced R.,J., etc. are all good people. So am I (according to
my wife, at any rate), but this hardly gives anyone a right to issue
magisterial and vituperative fiats about what is and is not intelligent,
moral, true, etc. I think Ravi has shown responsibility, wisdom and courage
as moderator in this instance. IMO, we will all be the benificiaries of his
effort, whether we realize it or not. So, my vote is "stay the course,
Ravi"...
Your first instinct was correct.

best to all,

Allan Curry
