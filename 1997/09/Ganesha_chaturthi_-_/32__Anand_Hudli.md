May we worship Ganesha who is the Unborn, the Undiffentiated, the
Formless One, who does not have Bliss (as an attribute but) who is
Bliss itself, who is the Nondual Infinite, the Supreme, who is
without attributes or qualities, without desires, and who is the
(visible) form of the Supreme Brahman.

Ganesha Chaturthi which marks the birthday of Lord Ganesha is
 celebrated on the fourth lunar day (tithi) in the month of bright
half of the lunar month Bhaadrapada. More precisely, the
celebration is on the day when the fourth tithi prevails during
the Madhyaanha Kaala (noon).

Since this  tithi began at about 2:30 AM EST today (Sept. 5)
and will end at about 4:30 AM EST tomorrow (Sept. 6), Ganesha
Chaturthi should be observed today (Sept. 5) in North America and
Western Europe too.

Interested list members may look up the archives for the detailed article
on Ganesha that I posted last year on September 16th.

Anand
