It's much older than Shankaracharya.  According to our shastras All
Brahmans should wear Rudrakshamala.  (Even some Vaishnava authorities
agree about this.)  They should also wear tilak every day though in
Gujarat we only wear tripundra in Shravana and on utsavas.  Other castes
can wear vibhuti and rudraksha mala if they believe in Shiva or Shakti.

For vairagis it is not required though they often do out of love of God.
For grhasthas it is required by the shastras.
