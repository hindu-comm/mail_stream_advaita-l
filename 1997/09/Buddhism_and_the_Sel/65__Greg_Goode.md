Martin's post seemed to be sort of an empirical collection of the way the
term "Advaita" is used, probably mostly in the West.  Not prescriptive
list, but a descriptive list. Just from the mere presence of this
definition (2) in the list you can't justifiably conclude that he is or is
not familiar with the traditional scriptures.  Definition (2) can be listed
equally validly by someone familiar or ignorant.  He's not saying (I
think!) that it's a TRUE definition, he's primarily saying it's in use.

These non-scriptural definitions of Advaita really ARE in use (listing
Martin's other two below, see [1], [2]).

Whether or not these latter 3 definitions correspond with the traditional,
historical definition (1), the term "Advaita" really IS used in these
several ways.  And the word "Advaita" is gaining currency every day in the
West, primarily in ways having NOTHING to do with the scriptures.  Right or
wrong.  You can see this if you do a web search or check out some American
or British bookshops.  Or check the mushy health/holistic/new-age
catalogues.  There are more and more teachers (they say) of "Advaita" on
the road all the time.  Just this Fall/Winter here in the New York City
area, there will be a total of 6 visits from these teachers that I know
about.  Such frequency has never happened before here.

Why would call it Advaita unless it actually was?  And if they are lying
what good are they to anyone else?

But you will not actually be helped unless you actually understand what
you are hearing.
