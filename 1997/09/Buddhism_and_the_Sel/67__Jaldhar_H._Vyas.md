I certainly don't think its impossible for foreigners to understand
Vedanta but it does require more effort.  And I don't see that many making
the effort.

Yes that would be a good example.  A number of the medieval "sant"
movements such as the followers of Kabir or even Sikhism could be
considered non-dual though they don't call themselves Advaita.  The
Vaishnava teacher Vallabha and his son Vitthal called their philosophy
shuddhadvaita (or "pure" advaita) because they believed they had purified
Advaita Vedanta of the "fallacy" of the Maya doctrine.  But even there it
is clear that they and there audience knew Advaita refers to
Shankaracharyas school.

I should clarify.  I didn't mean (non-Advaita) Vedanta i.e schools of
Vedanta other than Shankaracharyas.  I meant non-(Advaita Vedanta) i.e all
schools except Shankaracharyas including non-Vedanta schools.  Sorry for
the confusion.
