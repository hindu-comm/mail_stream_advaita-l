No one said they are the same in every respect, only that it is argued by
some distinguished Buddhist scholars that Buddhism does *not* deny the Self
or "substratum" as was so vehemently claimed by some Advaitin `experts' on
Buddhism. Of course there *are* differences between the two religions, for
instance, as you point out...

If karma kaaNDa refers to the efficacy of ritual, then I think Buddha did
claim believing that is a "fetter to liberation" which is automatically
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
given up when one directly apprehends the truth, even for a moment. But if
Buddha contradicts the Vedas on this point then he *must* be wrong, right?
