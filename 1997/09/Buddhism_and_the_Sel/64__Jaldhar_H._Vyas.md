Your purposes maybe.

This is the only acceptable definition.

How can you know "Non-traditional" works  are similiar unless you first
understand the traditional ones.

Why would call it Advaita unless it actually was?  And if they are lying
what good are they to anyone else?

But you will not actually be helped unless you actually understand what
you are hearing.

And in which fantasy land did you find these people?  In real life, the
tradition is for the Guruji to read from the shastra.  (Until very most
people couldn't afford an "inanimate" scripture of their own)  The
students read after him and memorize the text.  Then they discuss it
arguing for and against the position and at the end the Guruji explains
the siddhanta.  No lack of energy or cherished assumptions there.

Do yourself a favor and  actually read what "real gurus" have actually
written on the subject.  You'll find that they discuss many different
views accepting some and rejecting others.  In fact most shastras are
structured as conversations leading to definite conclusions.
