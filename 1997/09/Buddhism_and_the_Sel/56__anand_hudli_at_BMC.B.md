The issue of whether or to what extent Buddhism and advaita are alike
has been very controversial for quite some time. I have expressed some
of my views earlier, so I won't repeat them. I agree that Buddhism and
advaita have something in common, but I don't agree that they are
equivalent.
They are two different philosophies, inspite of the perceived similarity.

Let me explain. Buddha borrowed heavily from the Vedas, especially from the
upanishads, in formulating his philosophy. Even academic scholars agree that
many of the upanishads, and the celebrated Giitaa too, are from the
pre-buddhist era. So it is possible, nay very likely, that Buddha explained
many of the concepts from the Vedas, but in the language that people could
easily understand. He condemned violence and preached compassion. There is
no doubt that he was a great man. In fact, Hindu mythology elevates him to
an avatar of Vishnu. But we should remember that great men (and gods!)
may make mistakes too, just like us.

The mistake that Buddha committed was that he _selectively_ accepted some
portions of the Vedas and rejected others. He rejected the entire karma
kaaNDa. For the most part, his was an anti-vedic philosophy. He essentially
agreed with many upanishadic conclusions, especially the "neti neti"
principle. What he was trying to do is somewhat similar to "have the cake
and eat it too." You cannot manufacture a philosophy by partly accepting
the Vedas and partly rejecting them. You have got to explain the Vedas
_as_a_whole.

Advaitic conclusions are undoubtedly the conclusions of the Vedas, ie. the
upanishads. But advaita also explains the other parts of the Vedas,
including the karma kaaNDa, with remarkable consistency. What advaita
does reinforce is the idea of an Absolute Reality. This kind of
Absolutism is missing from Buddhism.

Unfortunately, many people who read Shankara and GauDapaada come to the
conclusion that their ideas were similar to those of the Buddhists. This
erroneous conclusion could be due to many reasons. Shankara, for example,
is perceived as being vehemently opposed to karma KaaNDa, the ritual
portion of the Vedas. This is a wrong perception. What Shankara opposed
is the Miimaamsakas' claim that karma  is the real purport of the
Vedas and that the upanishads are merely auxilliary or explanatory in
nature. Shankara claimed all along that the jnaana kaaNDa, ie. the
upanishads, represent the true import of the Vedas, and it is the
karma kaaNDa that is auxilliary. Shankara never said karma kaaNDa
should be abolished as the Buddhists did.

People who read just the GauDapaada kaarikas and Shankara's commentary
on the upanishads come to erroneous conclusions about advaita. To get a
correct understanding of advaita, one must study the prasthaana-trayi,
the three prasthaana's - Upanishads, the Brahma Suutra, and the Giitaa.
The advaitic position on karma kaaNDa is clearly brought out in the
Giitaa Bhaashhya of Shankara, and to a lesser extent in the Brahma
suutra Bhaashhya.

When one considers all the three advaitic interpretations, ie. those
of the upanishads, the Brahma suutra, and the Giitaa, it becomes amply clear
that advaita and Budhhism are different.
