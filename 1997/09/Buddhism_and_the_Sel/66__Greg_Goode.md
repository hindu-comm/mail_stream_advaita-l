As a "foreign and assimilated member of this list" I am listening carefully
for context, you can be sure.  Though most of the context you speak of has
nothing to do with e-mail.

You mention other "non-dual," non-Advaita Vedanta philosophies.  Could you
list some various forms, schools?  Is Kashmir Shaivism one of them?

I thought most non-Advaita Vedanta was also NOT non-dual.
