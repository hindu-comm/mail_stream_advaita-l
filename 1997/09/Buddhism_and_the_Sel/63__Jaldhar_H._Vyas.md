Exactly.  This why the study of linguistics and logic became so important
early on in India.  Given the slippery nature of our subject matter here
we should endeavor to be as precise as possible.

This is the problem that foreign and assimilated members of the list face.
You know the words but you don't always understand the context.  While you
are indeed correct that Adwaita means non-dual, it is usually used to mean
Advaita Vedanta.  There are other "non-dual" philosophies of Indian origin
but they are not usually labelled Advaita.  Only Vedanta.  This Advaita
Vedanta, has a history, tradition and dogma of which it is quite possible
to make meaningful comparisons.
