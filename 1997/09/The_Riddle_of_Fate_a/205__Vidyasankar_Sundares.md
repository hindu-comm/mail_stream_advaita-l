Very pertinent indeed, Charles, for this never-ending question of fate
and free will. Swami Sivananda explains the advaita viewpoint of prArabdha
and karma very well. Coming from the mouth of a sannyAsin, it should carry
weight for at least some members on our list. And it should also come as a
revelation to many, that such Hindu teachers do not teach a blind fatalism
that many of them have been accused of.

I found this page extrememly well-written, for the overview of various
philosophical views it presents on causality gets right to the point. In
general, the Darshana page is an excellent resource for learning about
Indian philosophical systems.
