Science is the rational study of empirical phenomena.  So you are correct
that Religion is not scientific as it is based on faith not observation.
But it can certainly be logical even if it is not scientific.  In the case
of this list we have history, tradition, a living lineage of teachers and
a set of beliefs which we can use to make meaningful logical statements.

I find it interesting that Dharmaraj in Hinduism is Mrtyuraja or death.
Just as the danda of death is unavoidable for any inhabitant of Earth the
danda of Dharma is inescapable.  I don't know who this Yogi Ramcharaka is
or where he got his information from, but Dharma certainly involves
setting standards of conduct and belief and judging those who fail to live
up to them.  Take a look at one of the dharmashastras sometime.
