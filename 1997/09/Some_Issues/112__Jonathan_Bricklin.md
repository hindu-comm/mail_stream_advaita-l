I understand.  My point is that practices like Vipassana and Hatha Yoga are
something of a bridge between science and religion.  One guru, in fact, has
gone as far as to claim that the Patanjali of the Yoga sutras made
religion a science of bare laws.  I don't know if I would go that far (my
sister, incidentally, teaches Hatha Yoga at Satchidananda's Integral Yoga
Institute in New York) but it's worth noting that the reason the practice
of Vipassana and Hatha Yoga have become the spiritual practice of many
Westerners precisely because their protocols are similar to science.  And
these protocols are, as well, an aid to understanding Advaita.
