I thought it was a cardinal principle of Buddhism that all *condtioned*
things were momentary. The "Unborn" (ie. Nirvana) is not conditioned, not
compounded and any relative concept cannot be applied to it.  As I see it,
Buddhism is simply denying the validity of all concepts about ultimate
reality, it is not denying ultimate reality. This is a significant
difference that seems to be frequently missed.
