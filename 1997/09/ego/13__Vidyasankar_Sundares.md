Yes, there is a passage in the udAna section of the pAlI canon that says
that nirvANa is unconditioned etc. And yes, Buddhism also does not deny
ultimate reality. Note however, that the theravAda schools of Buddhism do
not emphasize this at all. Only the vijnAnavAda and later madhyamaka
schools do.

Also, the specific equation of Atman with this ultimate reality is not
acceptable to any school of Buddhism. Probably because Buddhism starts
with the notion that there is no eternal Atman.
