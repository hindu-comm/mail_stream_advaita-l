 "ekaM sadvipraa bahudhaa vadanti" does not assert that there are
  multiple paths to Sat or Reality. Rather it says  that the sages call
  the one Reality by different _names_. This becomes clear if you look at
  the context of the mantra from the Rg Veda:

   indraM mitraM varuNamagnimaahuratho divyaH sa suparNo garutmaan.h |
   ekaM sadvipraa bahudhaa vadantyagniM yamaM maatarishvaanamaahuH ||

   Sages speak of the one Reality in different ways; they call It Indra,
   Mitra, Varuna, Agni, the heavenly bird Garutman, Yama, and Matarishvan
   (wind).
