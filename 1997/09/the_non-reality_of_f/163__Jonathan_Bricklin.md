I think it is a good working model, too.  A good start, at any rate.  But
after awhile,  if it is sincerely practiced, I would imagine it would start
to collapse as a model.  It does all depend on who you talk to, and the
Swami seems to be talking to, indeed helping to fashion, a strong jiva I:
"*you* have to assume, *you* have the sole responsibility to shape *your*
future.  At the same time, the Swami is removing one of the props of the
"I":  the sense of a self-created past.   But who believes that s/he can
create a future unless s/he has been creating a past?  Why not just drop
the myth of self creating altogether and let the impersonal interplay
between thoughts that gives the illusion of will shine through?
It's not that you *have* to assume an "I," the assumption *is* the "I".

The "past" and "future," agents of localization, do not need to be
emphasized anymore than they already are.  Seeing the past as fated is a
move toward delocalization.  But why emphasize the future so much?  Having
removed the illusion of an agent self from the past, why bring it back to
*face* the future?  Perhaps a next step in this "working model" might be to
turn around.  Instead of "facing" the future, walk backwards in time, not
moving forwards into the future as if we were crossing through a vast field
laid out before us.   We cannot move forwards into the future since we
cannot know what the next moment will be until *after* it has occurred.
The only way we can move into the future is backwards, with our eyes facing
the direction opposite from that toward which we are moving, seeing the
next moment only after we have passed through it, just as scenery comes to
a train passenger sitting with her or his back to the engine car.

A fair question.  We are all salespeople on this list server, trying to
convince others to accept our way of seeing things.  For me, the
non-reality of free will is a touchstone thought that (when it arises)
helps de-localize the sense of "I".  It also helps me to give a coherent
interpretation of the great sayings of Advaitism such as Tat tvam asi.

Yes!  Unfortunately it is a belief more touched upon than embraced.  But
without grace, a full embrace is not possible.  Don't you think?
