I have.

This is probably tantamount to enlightenment itself.

Not sure I understand the meaning of the following:

>that they may not ultimately *think* to be a reality.


Probably most people on this list are convinced the future is not a
reality.  It sounds like you are saying that somehow it really is a
reality, even though we think not.

I think it's a nice illustration actually.  Nisargadatta Maharaj spoke
several times about "reversing into the future" which meant (I'd have to
recheck the text to be sure, but) treating the future as though it will
take care of itself just as the past has.  Basically, a way to look at it
so we won't worry.
