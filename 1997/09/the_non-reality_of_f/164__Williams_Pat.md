I agree with the Swami and with Jonathan that it does, indeed, depend on
who you're talking to.  I feel sure this is good advice for many.  But
as we progress on the path our understanding must transform, and the
direction of transformation that Jonathan has outlined is correct, I
believe.  An example is the following statement of his:

I'd like to offer the additional suggestion that a still further step
toward full realization is to leave behind the concept of time, with its
"past" and "future" entirely.  Specifically, as to the "future," instead
of imagining that we're moving into the future (whether walking forward
or backward), perhaps we should seek to  realize that there is no past
or future, only now.  The one-moment-following-another sequence is an
illusion.  What seems to be a sequence of future events is the arising
of one's prarabdha as it shows itself to us.  The conditioned mind
either responds reflexively or thinks that we are responsible for
choosing and executing a response, which it then imagines that it does.
Only when we simply witness this arising do we avoid further
entanglements and so come a little closer to release.  If we seem to
have free will, it's a much subtler situation than our seeming
capability to choose how to act in various circumstances.  The free will
which we seem to have is the choice of whether we will (1) respond in
any way whatsoever to that which arises before us, or (2) simply witness
what arises.

As is often the case when we think and talk about things like this,
words, and even the concepts they name, fail.  So I realize that some of
the words I've used above are contradictory.  If we have no free will,
then we have no free will for choosing whether to react or witness.  I
know, I know.  Anything we can say about such matters is, at best, a
pointer toward the truth, so hopefully we'll gaze in the direction of
THAT rather than fixating on the pointer.
