    In the context of advaita, blesssings such as aayushhmaan bhava, are to
    be interpreted as follows. Shankara says in his VivekachuuDaamaNi that
    obtaining a human life is extremely difficult. But even after obtaining
    a human body, if one does not endeavor toward Atma-vidyaa, then an
    extremely rare opportunity has been lost. Who knows how many rebirths
    we will have to experience among animals and other species, before
     we get a human body? So it is extremely important to not waste time
    in useless pursuits while we have a human body. Because, ultimately Time
    is an important factor. If we spend our life time in making even a
    little progress toward Atma-vidyaa, we may or may not attain Mokshaa in
    this life  time, but we have made sure of getting a human body in the
    next birth and that too in a good family.  This has been confirmed by
    Lord Krishna in the Giitaa.

    It follows that if our life time is prolonged, we will have
    more time   and hence a better opportunity to learn Atma-vidyaa,
    provided, ofcourse, that we have rightly resolved about Atma-vidyaa. It
    is in this context that "aayushhmaan bhava" is to be interpreted. The
    intended meaning is "May you live long so that you will have the fullest
    opportunity to acquire Atma-vidyaa." It does not mean "May you live long
    and enjoy all sense pleasures to the fullest."

    Of course, many Mahaatmaa's did not live long and still achieved
    Brahma-saakshhaatkaara. These are to be taken as exceptions or as
    persons who had almost attained Brahman in their previous lives
    and who needed just a little more extra time as human beings to
    complete the process.

I have changed the subscription option from "open" to "By_owner". Change
was motivated by an unknown hacker, who arbitrarily  added many users to
advaita-l. Initially I changed the option to "open, confirm" but problem
persisted, hence decided to make it "By_owner".

This may not directly affect you. But indirectly it can. For instance if
you are going for a vacation and want to stop the mail temporarily,
instead of getting out and getting in, now it is better to use
"NOMAIL" option.

To do that you should send a mail to
listserv at tamvm1.tamu.edu with a blank subject line and body of the
message containing,
SET ADVAITA-L NOMAIL
to revert back, you can send a mail again to same address with
SET ADVAITA-L MAIL

Soon I will prepare a file explaining these commands and post it
regularly on the list. In case you have any problems with list, please
send a mail to aum at unix.tamu.edu, I have this address for dedicated use for
advaita-l and the associated error messages.

Thanks for your patience.
Sincerely,
Ravi
