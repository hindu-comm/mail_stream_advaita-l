I fully agree with comments made by Shri Vidyasankar on the topic of
cloning, particularly his comments re "progress".

As its implication to karma, if a person is "willing" to be cloned, I
think the person has a long way to go to recognizing to what he/she really
is. It does not matter whether the cloning is for spare parts, for seeing
an image of oneself for pure ego-gratification, or for pure "enjoyment" of
the individual, in my view, it implies only one thing: "That person's
misery is not over and it is destined that it continue for a long time to
come.  Not only that, the person thinks he/she is doing something. He/she
is not doing anything. Whether the re-production is by cloning, or by
standard sexual impregnation, or by taking life of an insect or a tree or
an animal (or a human) in later form, it makes very little difference. By
opting for the cloning, the individual is agreeing for further misery in
this life itself.
