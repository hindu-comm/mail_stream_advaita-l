But I did not say _anything_ about long e-mails. I myself have posted
long messages. If it takes a long message to explain something then it's
got to be long. I merely made a comment about appropriate material.

If you do not have time to read long mails, I suggest you set a filter
to kill messages by size. After all this is a list for discussing
advaita, but not for discussing advaita within X lines :-).

Sorry for writing one more mail on this. I did not want to be
misrepresented as opposing long mails, when I myself have posted many
such messages. This will be my last one on this topic.

Ramakrishnan.
