[mail on "ancient aircraft" deleted]

A small request to members. Please do not post stuff which are obviously
un-related to advaita. Whether there were ancient aircrafts or not is
absolutely irrelevant to advaita. A better place for this may be one of
the soc.*.indian groups or perhaps srh. Thanks.

Ramakrishnan.

I fully agree with you. Members should not pour long explanations
on topics under discussion  as there are limitations on the internet and
individuals time.

Let us have fruitful knowledge shared rather than fill up email messages
since media is available.
