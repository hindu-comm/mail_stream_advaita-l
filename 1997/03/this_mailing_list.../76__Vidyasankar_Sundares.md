No, no, the credit for starting this list must go to Ravishankar Mayavaram
at Texas A&M. I have put up a website for advaita vedanta, but I did not
start the mailing list. Also, I don't have much information about the
ITRANS encoding at this site. I have followed a slightly different
transliteration scheme, because I did not intend the text of the webpages
to be actually output in Devanagari script. For proper info about ITRANS,
please check the relevant websites, like the Sanskrit ftp site, or Giri's
pages. There are links to these pages from the pages at the site mentioned
below, but that is all.

Thanks for the vote of confidence. If the home page helps readers to
understand some of the issues related to advaita vedanta, I would consider
it worth the effort.
