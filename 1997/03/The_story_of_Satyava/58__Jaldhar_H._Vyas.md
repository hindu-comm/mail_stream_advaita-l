It has nothing to do with Vedanta.  The katha is in praise of pativrata,
the fidelity a wife has to her husband.  This is the highest dharma for a
woman and Savitri fullfilled it with such perfection Yamaraj (who is
Dharmaraj) was compelled to grant her wish.

Advaitins and Dharmic people in general are not suicidal.  If lives can be
saved (including ones own) there is no reason not to do so.

All the various stories in the shastras are for the purpose of teaching us
how to act.  Sometimes what is enjoined is quite simple and doesn't need
to be encrusted with weighty meaning.
