        Yes. Unless one is "realized" one has to follow Dharma.

        I am not so sure about this, but maybe I am just misunderstanding
your statement. Even if the sense organs don't work (coma is a good
example) the person is still alive, since his central nervous system and
brain are functioning (atleast partially). Even if the person is
"unconscious" the person can be alive. I believe that a person is alive
so long as the "soul 'is in' the body."

        I would say, than it in cloning you are just creating a body, just
like 'creating' a child, not "giving life" to it. If one is capable of
giving life to another, then surely, we should be able to revive all
corpses.
        However, I do agree with you and Vidya that the issue of cloning
has much more ramifications than, say, donating blood to an
already-existing body.

Namaste.
