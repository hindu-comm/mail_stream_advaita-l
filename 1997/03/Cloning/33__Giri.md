        I thought Vidya had answered this question [of karma] in his
informative e-mail. As he said, a person desiring to clone himself is
making a conscious decision similar to that of having a child. One is
responsible for the actions of the clone as much as one is responsible
for the action of one's children.
        Thinking about it, the decision to clone himself/herself is very
similar to that of having a child except that a partner need not involved
be involved in the process.

Namaste.
