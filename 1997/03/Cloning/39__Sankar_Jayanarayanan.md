What are the ethical implications on artificial insemination through
semen-donation? Suppose a man donates his semen to a woman whom he has never
met, and a baby is born to the woman, is the man duty-bound to bring up the
child like a father? I have no views on the subject of ethics in cloning or
artificial insemination and would like to know if the two issues are related
in any way. Thanks.

This is a much more common occurrence: there are people who bring up others
children as their own (e.g. Karna was the son of Kunti, but grew up in the
house of a charioteer, and Sita was "born of the earth" but was brought up by
king Janaka). Who exactly is the "real" parent: one who is genetically the
parent, or the one who looks after the child? Sita is often called Jaanakii,
but Karna never publicly acknowledged Kunti to be his mother. (These cases may
or may not include child adoption).
