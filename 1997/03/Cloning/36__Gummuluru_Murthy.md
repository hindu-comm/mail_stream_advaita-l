I am most surprised at the above statement. Shri Vyas seems to be saying
that cloning is just like donating blood. I would like to ask the question
Why the cloning ? What is the purpose ? Is it for spare parts ? Is it for
ego-gratification ? Is it for creating a "superior" human race ?
Any of these "actions" or "thoughts" have a karmic consequence
associated with it.

Unless and until we believe and accept that our thoughts and actions are
not ours but we are simply playing the role allotted to us in the supreme
scheme of things, in that state, there is no karma associated with the
thought or action.

Until then, any "action" or "thought" however trivial it may look like,
or however trivial one may try to make them out to be, has karma
associated with it. It is inevitable. Donating blood or a kidney has
its associated consequence. Certainly cloning or even the thought of
wishing to be cloned is not as trivial as the examples cited.

Now, the advaita literature is full of statements that the body is a
corpse powered by the sense organs. In cloning, you are giving life
to a body. Thus, you are "donating" more than the body.

However much one wishes to trivialize the (karmic) consequences of
cloning, I think the consequences are humengous and grave, both on
moral and philosophical grounds.
