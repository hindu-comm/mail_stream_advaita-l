You have put it in a much better way than what I did. The general point to
be made is the same.

It is nice to know that you have the same viewpoint on this matter.

I regard cloning as a more sinister way of bringing a child into the world
than the standard sexual impregnation.

In the standard procedure, the child happens to be a product of a mental
and physical union between a husband and a wife. It is not the objective.
Because of the mental union, the child is accepted with any deformities
and there is a natural love towards the child. In the cloning procedure,
the objective is to produce this product, which, if found defective, can
be destroyed with the least inhibition. The only objective of cloning
(apart from scientific ego-boosting) and the willingness to be cloned
is that there are spare parts available if any are to be replaced in
the donor without rejection. I am sorry to put it so cynically, but I
cannot see any worthwhile reason to pursue this procedure on moral or
ethical grounds. If there is, I would like to know.
