I'd have to agree.  From what I've read of the cloning process, I don't
see how this is any different from donating blood or even a kidney.  If
the person you donate blood to goes off and commits crimes you can hardly
be held responsible can you?  In this case you have donated a whole body.
The personality in that body will have no more relation to you than any
other random one.  If you choose to raise the clone it may have some
feelings for you much as a son or daughter would (and if you reciprocate
you would also then have the obligations of a father or mother) but you
could just as easily choose not to without any moral qualms.
