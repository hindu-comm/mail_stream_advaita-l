Consider the case where I have a book or an article and somebody wants to
copy it. Do I debate with that person why he or she wants to copy or what
they are going to do with that copy? Does my lending it out mean that I am
agreeing for further misery? What the other person does with the copy (makes
further copies, worships it, burns it ...etc) is absolutely of no concern to
me. I may not even care to identify with my book (but that is another issue
altogether :-)). I fail to see how there can be any attachment to the copy,
which rules out any karmic consequences.

regards,
Srinivas Sista.
