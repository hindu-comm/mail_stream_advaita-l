Hari Om Tat Sat!

Swami Sivananda has given an explanation on Shivaratri in his book "Hindu
Fasts & Festivals". Swami Krishnananda (a disciple of Swami Sivananda)
has given a more philosophical explanation in his book "Spiritual Import
of Religious Festivals". These discourses are pretty long. If you would
like to read these articles, you can send me an e-mail and I will e-mail
them to you.

Om Namah Sivaya!

Pannir
