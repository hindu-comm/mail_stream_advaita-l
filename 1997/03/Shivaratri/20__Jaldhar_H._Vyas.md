I wasn't able to get through to this site.  But I'm actually at work still
and we have a funny proxy setup here.

Anyway, one stotra which I'm sure up there and which I always think of at
Shivaratri is callded Shiva Manasa Puja. (It begins "Ratnaih kalpitam...")
It is is traditionally ascribed to Shankaracharya though we cannot prove
his authorship for sure. It describes in beautiful words the perfect puja.
As Bhaktas we can imagine all the things we would offer Bhagawan were it
not for our earthly limitations but no matter how humble, Pashupati the
dayanidhi will accept them all.  I encourage everyone to read it tomorrow.

(Shivaratri is tomorrow night, March 7th as Giri said.  One should fast
and maintain a vigil all night.  One should also visit a Shivalaya and do
abisheka to the Shivalinga with Rudri or Shiva Mahimna stotra if you are
not eligible.)
