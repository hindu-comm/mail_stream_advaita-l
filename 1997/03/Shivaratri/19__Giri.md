Namaste.
        On the occasion of Shivaratri (the holy night dedicated to Lord
Shiva) [March 7], please try to visit the sanskrit document site
        ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/private/sanskrit/sanskrit.html
which contains around 20 stotra-s on Lord Shiva, some of which are
translated. If you like to add some more, please let me know.
        Another interesting site to visit is on saiva siddhanta
        http://www.geocities.com/Athens/2583/
The site also has links to other sites on kashmir shaivism, viira shaivism
etc. May Lord Shiva always make us aware of His ever-present grace.
