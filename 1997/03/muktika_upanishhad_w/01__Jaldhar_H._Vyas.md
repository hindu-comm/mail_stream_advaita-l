And they expend a lot of energy and ink on it don't they?  Which means
they must think its important doesn't it?

Abhava or absence _is_ significant in Mimamsa.  It is a pramana.  I'll
give you an example.  There isn't a Vedic text that specifically says
Shudras cannot wear the yagnopavit but in the texts that describe the
upanayana samskara, the procedure is given for Brahmans, Kshatriyas, and
Vaishyas and Shudras are not mentioned.  It's on this basis they are
barred from wearing it.  When the Arya Samaja made arguments similar to
yours to allow Shudras to wear it, all Astikas vehemently opposed the
idea.

I mean is it taken literally or not.

And we, having brains in our heads, should be able to tell whether they
are being truthful or not.

The smrtis and nibandhs I've quoted are the ones which have been in use
for knowing Dharma for hundreds of years.  Now out of the blue this
unheard of work comes along making outrageous claims.  Of course I'm going
to compare it with what I already know.

My point is there aren't 100 foot walls between "western" and "eastern"
scholarship.  Quite orthodox people have made use of indology to some
degree or the other.

You are standing things on your head if you start off with an advaita
tradition or a dvaita tradition.  All the sampradayas are based on the
Vedic tradition.  They have to justify themselves in terms of that.  After
all advaita and dvaita are just adjectives and the noun they modify is
Vedanta.  So even if the opposing camps don't want to accept what the
other has to say, they should be aware of it.  Otherwise they are
needlessly blinding themselves.

Then listen to my shastric ones.

So now one has to be a sarvajna to be a scholar?  We might as well disband
the list then.  No one here qualifies.  I'm right far often than I'm wrong
and you know it.

Shankaracharya isn't St. Peter and his successors the Jagadgurus aren't
the Pope.  They are master teachers and their teachngs should be listened
to and understood.  But things don't become right just because they say
so.  I need to use my brain and look at what the eternal Shruti and its
ancillaries say and compare it to get the full picture.  And if there is a
discrepancy I need to question and explore it.  That's the way I'm the
same as Shankaracharya and that's the only way I'm going to be able to
pass his teachings on to a new generation of Brahmans.

Hmm let's see how about MM Chinnaswami Shastri and his student MM
Pattabhirama Shastri two of the greatest mimamsakas of the 20th Century?
Both wrote original works and commentaries on Mimamsa and were professors
in universities preparing critical editions and the like.  Or the many
Pandits all over India who advise the bhaktas on dharmic matters.  You
don't think they make use of all available resources?  Or how about
the Jagadguru of Sringeri who seems to have read a few books on Indology
in his time?

It would be too late.  While you were ensconsed in your ivory tower the
work had already begun.  (Mimamsa is after all a practical tool.  That's
why its referred to as Bhatta Tantra.)  So I can't found anything but I
can certainly help.  I don't encourage people asking me dharmic questions
because I feel they should talk to someone older and more experienced but
sometimes they still do.  I give answers which my grandfather and even his
grandfather would approve of.  And I do it based on _all_ relevant
knowledge.
