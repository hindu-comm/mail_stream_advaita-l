But that did not happen!  In any case more pathetic is pretending to be have
read the shruti and expounding on them when ignorance of basic facts like
brahma loka is evident.

I thought of stopping replying to you. But _you_ secured _my_ agreement?!!! I
think you are under some major confusion. Let me make myself clear. You secured
my agreement on nothing, nada, zilch (on the topics we argued about). On the
other hand you have been forced to take back statements about the purANa-s and
more importantly brahma loka (with Giri).

No thanks. I thought you were talking about shrI sha.nkara and his views. But
in the last post you made it clear that shrI sha.nkara is not St Peter and it
is your grandfather you have in mind when you elucidate on "dharma"!! Huh, you
can keep that stuff to yourself.

Ramakrishnan.
