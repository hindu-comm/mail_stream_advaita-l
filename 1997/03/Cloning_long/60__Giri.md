        I agree, of course. What I meant was a person is alive as long
as the "soul" is in the body. But who is the Lord of the chariot ?
Atman/Self. I don't have the english translation with me, but am just
translating from the sanskrit transliteration.

[Katha upanishhad.h]

aatmaana.N rathitaM viddhi shariira.N rathameva tu .
buddhiM tu saarathiM viddhi manaH pragrahameva cha .. 1.3.3..

     Know the Self as the lord of the chariot and the body as the
     the chariot, know the intellect as the charioteer and the mind as
     the reigns.

i.e As long as the lord of the chariot, Self, "exists" in the body, one is
"alive."

        I am not sure what translation you followed, but certain books
like 'The 13 principal upanishads' by Robert Hume, which seem to be a
favorite among western readers and web users miss the point completely. He
asks, if the world is unreal, why didn't the sages starve to death ? It is
better not to read translations by such persons since they have not even
understood the basis of advaita/maya/avidya. I am not saying my
translations are any better :-) but I know better than saying since the
world is "unreal," we can all starve to death.

        Atman is always the silent witness. Like the two birds example
in the upanishhad-s. It is not the occupant, but the Lord of the chariot.

>Chariot implies a journey. Whose journey is it ? Atman does not need it.
>Where is this journey to ? Is this journey inward in search of "Who am I?"
>(Atman already knows the answer). Or is this journey into the infinite ?

        Where is the journey ? There is no journey at the paramartha
level. Only what is born, journeys and then dies. Atman, being never born,
can never die and, therefore, never cease to exist.

One who is without knowledge, [for him] the senses are like wild horses
that don't obey the driver of the chariot  (1.3.5) and being without
knowledge and unmindful does not reach the goal but wanders in samsara
(1.3.7). Higher than sense objects is the mind, higher than that is the
faculty of knowledge and higher than that is the self, and higher than
that is the Unmanifest and higher than that is the purusha, who is the
highest goal of the journey. He is the SELF in all existences and is seen
by the seers of perfect understanding (1.3.9-12).
        Who says there is a journey ? Only who thinks he is a finite
individual with certain likes and dislikes thinks he is journeying.
        What exactly is the journey or the sadhana ? It is only the
journey from who we think we are (a body-mind complex) to who we really
are. There is a journey if we think we are the body-mind, but there is no
journey if you already *know* you are the Atman. That is, one has to be
careful at what level one is talking in. In the vyavahaara level, the
senses have to be controlled and restraint placed on the senses to reach a
"goal" but there is no difference between the seeker and the sought in the
ultimate sense.

You raise some very interesting points on cloning:

> Because of the mental union, the child is accepted with any deformities
> and there is a natural love towards the child.

        This may have been true (or it may be still true for certain
people). However, in India, the sex of the child is determined and if it
is female, it is aborted. There are hundreds of cases *every day* Besides
this, in "advanced countries" like the USA, the same thing happens if the
child is deformed or has genetic flaws. I don't see any great love
expressed because the "baby" is in the womb due to physical and mental
union. Of course, I am not saying that this is the case for everyone or
that it is the majority, but if one does not want to love a child because
it is female, or because it is deformed, the options of aborting it still
exist in any civilized world. This does not depend on the manner in which
the baby was conceived. Of course, none of this is dharmic.

        One can argue that a child of "natural conception"  has a chance of
getting more love than a cloned child. Maybe. I don't know. Ultimately,
it depends on the "parents" and the society on how and why it views a
"normal" child as different from a "cloned" child.

        Though certain members of this list may disagree with me, I do
feel that the whole concept of "true human love" is flawed. We certainly
don't love another person for his/her body. If so, we wouldn't burn/bury
their corpse. If we love them for their mind, then we should hate them
when they are sleeping (when the mind is not "functioning") or after they
die. The love of a husband/wife is the love for the Self in that person,
not because of their mind/body.  In a sense, we don't love an "other"
person, but love our Selves, since, in essence, we are all One without
a second.

        What I am saying is that the same thing is happening every day
for normal conception. Not that it is right/wrong.

        I do not think it is as simple as thinking 'spare parts would be
available.' In a world in which a son is unwilling to donate a kidney to
his father/mother (even if it matches), why should the clone behave any
differently ? Given that having a clone is similar to having a child, the
clone would have the rights of an individual who has to make a choice of
donating his/her organs to the family member.

        It is adharmic not to be celibate till marriage. And after
marriage, it is dharmic to be faithful to your spouse. Naturally, these
cases (like donating semen etc) falls under the class of "adharma." Any
action done with the idea of 'I am the body/mind" has its karmic
implications, whether the person is guilty of sin or not. I think Shri
Gummurulu Murthy pointed this out. Atleast that is my understanding.

I would just quote Vidya's original posting on this issue:

"The general Hindu view also attaches a good deal of importance
to those who rear the child. Karna remained Radheya till the end, even
after he knew that he was Kaunteya. Krishna is as much Yashoda's son as he
is Devaki's. Thus, although a cloned child may be an exact genetic replica
of the donor parent, the mother who carries the pregnancy to term, and
those who rear the child are also its parents."

        One of my friends was adopted and followed the gotra of his
adopted parents. Later in life, he came to know of his real parents and,
hence, his "real" gotra. However, during his marriage, he refused to
identify with the gotra of his "real" parents (who abandoned him) though
he was careful enough not to marry someone from either of the above
gotras. This may be an isolated case, but the priest said this was fine.

Namaste.
