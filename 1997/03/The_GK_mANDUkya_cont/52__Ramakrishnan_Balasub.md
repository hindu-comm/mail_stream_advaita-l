Yes, that's the understanding I got. The quote is found in Anandagiri's
TIkA to the GK bhAshhya. Anadagiri seems to be explaining why
shankarAchArya has not quoted the mANDUkya in the BSB at all. His
comment is that there are many upanishhad-s in the atharva veda and
shankarAchArya does not use all of them in the BSB since they weren't
used by bAdarAyaNa.

I checked up with my copy of the muktika and it indeed assigns these two
the kR^ishhNa yajur veda. I also checked up Deussen's 60 upanishads of
the veda and he has listed these two as being in the atharva veda!
However in the previous section he quotes verses from the muktika. He
has also not mentioned any discrepancy between Anandagiri's comment and
the muktika. Perhaps there are two different versions of the muktika and
Deussen's version is a different one?

I'll check up both the lists (your's and Vidyasankar's) with my copy of
the muktika and inform you later.

IMO, the arguments of the modern "scholars" on this are very
unconvincing. First, they are utterly convinced that there is something
fishy about the attribution of the GK bhAshhya to sha.nkara without any
sound basis. Then they proceed to give all kinds of arguments. Of
course, the Indologist camp is pretty divided with Ingall's et al
thinking that the attribution is genuine and Protter etc doubting this.

shankarAchArya clearly explains at the beginning of his bhAshhya that
the first chapter was written by gauDapAda to explain advaita on the
basis of the veda. The second is to demonstrate the falseness of the
world through reasoning, the third is to establish advaita through
reasoning and the fourth is to refute non-vedic schools using their own
terminology. He explicitly states why the four chapters were written.
For me the case is closed based on the words of sha.nkarAchArya: all
chapters were written by gauDapAda.

There are two reasons, IMO:

1. without the passages which dismiss theories of creation and
misinterpreting it as actually supporting creation, the MU cannot in any
way twisted to mean dvaita.
2. A verse extolling prANa is found in GK I. Of course Ananda tIrtha
claimed to be an incarnation of vAyu and named himself madhva (which is
supposedly mentioned in the R^ig veda), and this would prove to be very
convenient occassion to assert that he knows better than anyone else.

The GK hardly advances any dvatic tenet as you say, but neither does
tatvamasi or ahambrahmAsmi. But that hasn't stopped the dvaitins from
giving interpretations like (a)tattvamasi and ah(ey)am brahmAsmi!

He knows that these two are from the atharva veda. Deussen says that
other than the prashna and the muNDaka, all the other atharva
upanishhad-s were "written" later. He thinks so because sha.nkara has
not used them in the BSB. But, to his credit he quotes Anandagiri whose
statement would invalidate his position.

Ramakrishnan.
