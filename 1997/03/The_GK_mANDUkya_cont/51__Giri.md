        I think Duessen is mistaken as he repeatedly remarks that Shankara
does not quote from atharva upanishhads. For example, he says Shankara
does not quote from Mandukya, Maitri nor any of the AtharvaNa upanishhad
(page 32 in his book 'The system of vedanta'). He repeats this contention
in other places also. I, naturally, assumed that he meant _minor_
upanishhad-s, though Deussen does not say that. Deussen, in the earlier
portion of the book remarks that Atharva veda was written down much later
than the three other vedas and still struggles to gain "recognition."
I did not want to think that Deussen may not know prashna and mundaka
upanishhad were from the atharva veda.

Thanks for checking.

        Since I have also made the table in the jaguar site with veda
affliation and subject matter, I will cross check the table with the above
table this weekend. The table in jaguar site follows the order of
upanishhad-s as given in the muktika (which may not be a good way).

        I took some of the information from a book titled '112 upanisads'
and I cross-checked a few of them (I have around 45 of them in sanskrit)
with the beginning of saanthi.

        In the BSB, Ramayana is quoted only once. According to Deussen
('system of vedanta) it is 1036,5 i.e page number 1036 of Shankara's
brahma suutra bhashya published by Bibl. Ind.  (which contains 1155
pages). Cross-referencing this number with the suutra bhashya, it should
be near the end of BS III:4. The verse quoted is ramayana 1.1.1, according
to Deussen. I have read somewhere else that it is in BS III:4:47-50.

        Sure. Markandeya Purana is quoted in 208, 15 and 872,8 of
Shankara's BSB. This corresponds to near the end of BS I:3 (should be near
BS I:2.21-23) and near the start of BS III:3. The reference for both the
quotes in Markandeya purana is 45,64.

        Deussen also notes atleast three different quotes from other
puraNaa-s but fails to mention which those are. Vishnu Purana and Shiva
purana are quoted in the vishnu sahasranama bhashya. I think he quotes
Shiva purana to explain the world rudra. Kartik also told me something
about this. Shankara quotes from the brahmananda purana in the lalita
trishati bhashya. Well, lalita trishati itself is in that purana.

        Please note that some of these numbers are from memory. I will
correct them, if there are some errors, after I go home and check the
book(s). I had prepared the above list to send to Rama in a private e-mail
but now I don't need to :-)

Namaste.
