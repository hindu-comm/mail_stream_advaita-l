I forgot to give some info. GK I.16 seems to be an  important verse in
the tradition. sha.nkarAchArya goes into some detail explaining the
verse in the GK bhAshhya. He quotes it in his BSB. sureshvarAchArya
quotes it in his naishkarmya siddhi. Interestingly enough the same verse
is quoted in the mAnasollAsa (first chapter) also.

Giri quoted from the Apastamba sUtra:

The mAnasollAsa begins with a similar verse:

 AtmalAbhAt paro lAbho nAstIti munayo viduH |

 The sages say that there is no attainment greater than the attainment
of the   self
