There is also an independent bhAshya by Sankara on the praSna, which
belongs to the atharvaveda.

I also have the brahma and garbha upanishads assigned to the kr.shNa
yajus. My information came from Sri V. Sadagopan, a Visishtadvaita scholar
who writes regularly on Tattvaloka, a journal published by the Sringeri
matha. If Deussen's understanding of Anandagiri is correct, there is some
discrepancy somewhere. Many of the upanishads listed in the muktikA are
texts without a living legacy, so it becomes difficult to classify all of
them.

There is another table listing these 108 upanishads at
        <http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~vidya/advaita/upanishad.html>.
The table arranges these texts by veda affiliation and by subject matter.
I would also be grateful for corrections to this table.

Is this quotation "rAmarAvaNoryuddham rAmarAvaNayoriva"? Are any other
verses of the Valmiki Ramayana quoted?

          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That is very interesting. I know that there is a Vishnu Purana quote in
the Bhagavad Gita Bhashya, but the Markandeya Purana quote is unknown to
me. Could you provide the details of this reference?
