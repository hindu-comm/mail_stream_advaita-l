This is a "definition" Ribhu gives Nidagha, from the Vishnu Purana:

"Know this whole universe to be the one undivided nature of the supreme being,
entitled Vasudeva."

...

"Even as the same sky is apparently diversified as white or blue, so Self,
which is in Truth but one, appears to erroneous vision distinct in different
persons. That One, which here is all things, is Achyuta(Vishnu); than whom
there is none other. He is I; He is Thou; He is All; this universe is His form.
Abandon the error of distinction."

-Kartik
