To theorize an ego with a free will is in direct contrast with
Brahman--creating a decided duality.

To imagine the very existence of ego (as seeker) also implies a
duality, whether it requires grace or not to discover its source.

These should be easily discarded by the intrinsic insight of advaita.

Where's the problem therefore?  In diffusing the historic hypnotism?

Atmavichara is the effective counterweapon.


Namaste.
