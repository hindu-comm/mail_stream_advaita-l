A delayed response to Shri Giri's posting.  I am grateful to Shri Giri
for clarifying some points for me on the chariot analogy of the Katha
upanishhad.

Whether the body is a corpse or under what conditions it is considered
"alive" is brought in in the context of the earlier discussion on
cloning and "donation" of the body. This is only of side-interest in
the present topic.

I am following S. Radhakrishnan's "The principal upanishhads". While it
is brief in commentary (on this topic), it is good and helpful with
individual verse meanings and reference to Shri Shankara's commentary.

I find the verses 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 very illustrative.

Oh, I agree that there is no journey at the paramartha level. But Lord
Yama refers to a journey and the question is: what is the journey about
and whose journey it is.

At the paramartha level, there is no journey. Atman is the same as the
nirguna brahman and there is no journey.

But the Atman, in conjunction with the body, senses, mind and the buddhi
becomes jeeva (jeevatma or the soul) and for that entity, there is a
journey. This entity is the enjoyer or the subject of the journey
(atmendriya-mano-yuktam... verse 4).

In my view, the journey referred to by Lord Yama, is not a journey of
one life but a series of lives which the jeeva has to go through before
the jeeva recognizes that it is the same as the Atman. Then it sheds the
extraneous upadhis (body, buddhi, mind and the senses) and recognizes
sameness with Atman. At that stage, there is no journey anymore. The
chariot, charioteer, reins and the horses all disappear.

Am I correct in understanding it in this light ?

Yes, indeed. Like all concepts in advaita, the level at which we see and
talk is the important one: because any concept is correct at the level at
which we speak. The "journey" referred above is a good example.
