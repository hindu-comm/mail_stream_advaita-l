Some verses from bhaja govindaM

self-settledness comes Jeevan Mukti.

Oh mad man ! Why this engrossment in thoughts of wealth ? Is
there no one to guide you ? There is only one thing in three
worlds that can save you from the ocean from samsara. Get into
that boat of satsangha quickly.

        Sat sangh means the company of Sat (Truth). Though sitting at the
feet of an "enlightened person" is a great satsangh, the best satsangh is
abiding in the Atman, which is Sat-chit-ananda.

        Actually there is no journey to "finish." Though we think we are
out in the sun and getting burned, we are only in the shade. It is only
attachment to the unreal which makes us *think* we are ignorant. One of
the obstacles is to think 'I am ignorant.' There never was a time in which
we were not That and there never will be a time in which we will be not
That. This is explained beautifully in upadeshasahasri and can also be
experienced. In fact, there is no "we."

        Thanks for the exact quote. There is a similar quote in Chandogya U.
too.

Namaste. aum shaanti.
