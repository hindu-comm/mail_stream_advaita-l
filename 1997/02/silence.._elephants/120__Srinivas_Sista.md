Reminds me of a story told by our math teacher.

A man is standing at a busy intersection in a big city and waving
polka dots. One of the persons passing by becomes curious and stops
to question him.

Q:"What are you doing?"
A:"I am driving elephants away with my polka dots"

Q:"But there aren't any elephants here!"
A:"See how effective they are!"
