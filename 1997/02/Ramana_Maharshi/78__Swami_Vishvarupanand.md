There was a discussion some time ago on the validity of Sri Ramanamaharshi and his being recognized by a Shankaracharya. Well, a couple of days ago I received the Dec/Jan 1997 issue of Tattvaloka, the official magazine of Sri Sharada Peetham, Sringeri, and I think it is interesting, that 40 pages of the 96 are dedicated to Ramanamaharshi as "offering at the feet of Ramanamaharshi in the centenary year of his advent at Arunachala". One is an article about the Sringeri Jagadguru, Nrisimha Bharati Swamigal recognizing Ramana's greatness, the other an elaborate condensation of three books of conversations with the Maharshi.
This should be ample proof of Math's agreement with Ramanamaharshi.

Greetings and Om,
Vishvarupananda
