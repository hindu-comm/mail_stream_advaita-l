Namaste.
        If there is something Adharmic about Swami Vivekananda's and
Paramahansa Yogananada's behaviour, I would like to know what it is. Right
now I am trying to live up to their standards and I am curious to know
what it is that they have neglected or performed wrongly.

I have not neglected my tradition. In fact I am trying to get established
in the ethical culture and I also perform the rituals, i.e. applying
sacred ash & kumkuma (this has attracted a lot of stares and queries. Is
it the same in your place too or is it just in Kansas?), feeding the
animals, birds, etc. All these I picked up from my parents and my
Paramguru's book "All About Hinduism"  has helped me to understand why we
do these things.  It is in the language department that I am an extremely
slow learner. You are right, after my studies I should go learn under a
qualified teacher.
