namaste.

I was reading the advaita-l archives and have a couple of questions.

Could you please share this with us? I don't have the upanishad with me.

Thanks.

Evidently, Shankara uses the term "Saguna Brahman" to speak of Nirguna Brahman
being (erroneously) conceived as having Gunas.

In other words, when Nirguna Brahman is "seen" from the Vyavaharika level,
it appears as Saguna Brahman, i.e, endowed with Gunas.

I wish to know the Vedantic concept of Saguna Brahman well, since my only
sadhana is daily prayer. I would very much appreciate any responses to my
question: Saguna Brahman is obviously our own (mis)conception of
Nirguna Brahman. So if we do not worship Saguna Brahman or if we do not care
to "think" of Nirguna Brahman, does Saguna Brahman exist?

Shankara agrees that devotion to Saguna Brahman is Vedantic, but still,
he doesn't say that Ishvara is seen as distinct from our own (mis)conceptions
of Nirguna Brahman.

To put my question more clearly: does Ishvara exist if I don't believe in him?

According to the Vishnu Purana, Shalagrama is a sacred pilgrimage spot
for worshippers of Vishnu. But presently, no one knows its location, and
it has remained untraceable for a long time.

Nowadays, Shalagrama is worshipped as a sacred stone.
