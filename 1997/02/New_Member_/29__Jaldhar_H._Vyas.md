I understand were you're coming from.  I was born and brought up in
England and while my parents did their best to give me a good background
in our traditions they were not able to answer advanced questions.
Luckily they were able to steer me to people who could and with their
blessings I can say I know a little today.

That's very interesting about Somerset Maugham.  I'll have to take a look
at that book.  I should warn you however that a lot of people read into
Advaita things which aren't actually there.  It is far better (and not
that much more difficult) to learn Sanskrit and read the shastras than to
rely on Somerset Maugham or the LSE etc.  I think you'll find this list is
a valuable resource too (as long as you ignore some of the nuttier members.)
