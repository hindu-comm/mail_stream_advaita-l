 Dear Friends

   Some questions,

 1) When we look at the Picture of  GOD  what ever the description
    shown ( Shanka, chakra, Four hands etc ....) , Is it just an Imagination
    or the description from a person who has really seen  GOD.
    Any Ref. from great authors ....


2) As i know Shankara composed " Bhaja Govindam" (hope i am right)
   Why do we consider Shankara is against Vishnava philosophy
   Since Shankara composed Bhajagovindam I am sure he was worshipping
   Lord Vishnu.

3)  I don't deny the fact that Ramayana and Mahabarath ocuured on this
    Earth. I want to know how can we relate to Darwin's Theroy and
    Evelution theory. How old is Ramayana some thing like 5000BC or...

    Because Evelution  Theory is based on 2-3 Million years.

    So Can we conclude First is Evolution and Surrvival for the Fittest
    and then Ramayan -. > Mahabharath -> Kaliyug (present).
    I am sure somewhere i am wrong.


  4)  How did Shankara 's life came to an end.

   regards

   srinivas Prasad
