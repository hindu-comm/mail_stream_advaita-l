as religious people our agenda is different from a professor.  Certainly
if our traditions say the vajrasuci is a real upanishad it bears weighty
consideration.  (But have you considered the published work called
Vajrasuci Upanishad is the same as the one mentioned in Muktika?)

A better question might be has any said anythning about them at all?

Which is fine with me.  however we needn't be so restrictive.  For
instance one of the "minor" upanishads Shankaracharya has quoted is
Nrsimhottaratapaniyopanishad.  Ramanuja has I believe also quoted it so we
can be rather more sure of its authenticity than the Allah upanishad which
is quoted by no one.  Similiarly there are other logical methods we can
use to weigh the various claims.

In fact the same thing is true of Shankaracharyas own works.
Critical scholars are only 100% sure four of his works are genuine;
Brahmasutrabhashya, Taittiryopanishadbhashya, Brhadaranyakopanishadbhashya,
and Upadesha Sahasri.  The Vani Vilas edition of his complete works which
most Advaitins consider authoritative contains rather more than that but there
are many works ascribed to him which aren't in there.  Do you the editors
just flipped a coin to decide what to put in or was there some process?

As far as our tradition is considered sannyasa is equivalent to death.
you can't come back from the dead so perhaps suicide is the only
acceptable way out.
