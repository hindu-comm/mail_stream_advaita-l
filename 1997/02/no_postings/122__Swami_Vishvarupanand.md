a day or two ago, I received 4 cyptic messages from listserv telling me 20
requests I never made re: advaita-l were incorrect and all future messages
would be automatically rejected. SInce then I've not received any individual
postings from advaita-l -- is there something wrong with the forum??


Nothing wrong. Someone tried to sing off and, not knowing how to do it, employed a lot of fantasy, making the system send this messages to the entire list. So don't worry. All is well.

Greetings,
Vishvarupananda
