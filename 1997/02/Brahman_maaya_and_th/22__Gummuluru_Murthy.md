Brahman, that is described by negation through the various upanishads
(neti, neti) is well beyond what the human mind can grasp through its
only tool, the logic.

Human mind is in the control of maaya which is anaadi. Human mind cannot
grasp maaya either.

Then what purpose is the intricate explanation by the advaitic sages to
try to make advaita understandable to the human mind ? [I do not mean by
this statement that sadhana or meditation is irrelevant. Meditation is
the only procedure that leads to advaitic experience.]

The only thing that is required is: we should be blessed with advaitic
experience. Tarka or intricate probing into advaitic philosophy is only
of technical interest.

On the other hand, the first Brahma sutra says "athaato brahma jignaasa",
i.e enquiry into Brahman. Will that enquiry utilizing the thought process
of the brain (mind) lead to realization graspable by the mind ?

Do I make sense in the above questions ? If they make sense, I am sure
they were already alluded to in the advaitic literature. I would be most
grateful for any reference.

Gummuluru Murthy
