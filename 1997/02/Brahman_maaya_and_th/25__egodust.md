The only thing the mind is capable of realizing is that it hasn't the
ability to realize [Reality].  Enquiry is the means for the Mind to
discover this.  Once it's discovered, the Mind can no longer hold its
jiva captive and victimized/manipulated [as a leaf at the mercy of the
wind].  And since the Mind is no longer the commander-in-chief attempting
to dictate Reality, the Self (Paramatman) automatically surfaces.  In the
strictest sense, there is nothing (no entity) that realizes anything else
(another entity).  Rather the Self shines unimpeded.  The fogbank of
avarana is isolated in the beam of atmavichara and burned away by the
sun of the Self.  Atman was always there, only the mysterious fog seems
to block it.  Yet such fog isn't in the least substantial.  Here lies
the paradox that would be better left forgotton, for indeed *there is no
paradox* upon honest enquiry!  It simply all crumbles itself into a dream
of perfect void.

Yes, Brahman is all that is.  Doubts are so many fictions...
