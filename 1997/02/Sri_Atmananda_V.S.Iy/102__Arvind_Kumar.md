Hi,

I purchased my copies of Atma Darshan and Atma Nirvriti
(and Atmananda Tattwa Samhita) from

The Inner Directions Journal

Their website is http://www.innerdir.org

Phone numbers as follows: (619) 471 5116 or 619 471 0337 (fax)
For purchases, there is (800) 545-9118

I am not aware of the availability of books by VSIyer from IDJ
but will copy this message to IDJ to find out if these book are also
available from them. I'll also send a copy of this to the original
questioner (Allan Curry).

These books are published in the US by Advaita Publishers,
P.O.Box 5046, Austin TX 78763 but I have had no
correspondence with them to know whether they are still at this
address.

I have been a member of this list for a few months now but this
is my first post. I joined this list at the invitation of
'Egodust' (thanks, Frank) and have been rather enjoying
the postings. I live in a suburb of Dallas, work for
a large Swedish telecommunications company (Ericsson) and
have access currently to this list
only through my workplace. This means that I have almost no time
to post (donot know if that is good or bad:)) nevertheless it is
great to be in Satsang with this list whenever the opportunity
presents itself!

I have corresponded with some on this list via e-mail, but I
want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution
of all on this list, so
Thank you to all of you for being here!

In Oneness,


Arvind Kumar
