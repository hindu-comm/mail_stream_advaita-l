Hello,

I am not at present a subscriber to this list but I am hoping that
some of you may be able to help me obtain copies of books by these
two authors. I believe titles by Sri Atmananda include:

                Atma Darshan
                Atma Nirvriti

and titles by V.S.Iyer include:  Tattva Jnana and Tattva Vichara

I'm finding it very difficult to locate these books so any help you
might give would be greatly appreciated.  Please email me directly
if you know anything about them...

thanks sincerely,
                        Allan Curry
