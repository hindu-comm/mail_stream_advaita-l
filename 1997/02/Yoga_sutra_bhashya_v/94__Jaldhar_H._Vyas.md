I'm saying there are a great many places where it should have been quoted
and wasn't.

He must have his reasons and no doubt they are good ones.  However
stressing this work is his innovation.  It is not an authority of the past
and should not be presented as one.

You're right.  We've taken this subject about as far as it can go.

It is this which leads us to conclude the sectarian statements aren't to
be taken literally.  If it were simply a matter of a Purana contradicting
the Vedas an opponent could explain the situation away by saying the Vedic
worship is lower knowledge while worship of Vishnu Bhagawan is higher
knowledge.  (In fact this is what Vallabha does though with a lot more
sublety.)  He is deprived of that argument if we show that one and the
same purana is self-contradictory.  (Oh and this can't be rebounded back
against Advaita which also speaks of higher and lower knowledge,because
the Vedas explicitely admit to having two topics, Karma and Jnana, and
the statements proclaiming the superiority of one over the other are not
meant to be universal.)

Then I agree with you.

Not so.  I'm arguing the negative side so it is sufficient for me to prove
my point to show that the shastras _don't_ cite the Vajrasuchi and
Muktika. This is abhava pramana and it is perfectly acceptable for
Mimamsakas.  Now one problem is I don't have access to every Dharmashastra
but I do have the ones which are in use today by the learned Brahmans in
Gujarat, Mitakshara, Hemadri, Dharma Sindhu, and they don't mention the
Vajrasuchi, Muktika, or any text that has the notion that Brahmanhood is
based on anything other than birth.  If you like, the next time I go to
the library I'll check other famous texts but I'm willing to bet they
won't mention it either.

Take for example "Tat tvam asi".  Different thinkers have different ideas
about what exactly this means but all agree it means _something_ important.

Then there are texts such as the various sectarian upanishads where there
isn't unanimous agreement and one party or the other feels there is
downright incompatability and is prepared to simply throw the text out.
The Vajrasuchi belongs in this second group.

Exactly.

And I said before I accept the authority of these two great teachers.  But
it's not enough.  Where are the 14th century authorities who vouch for
this work?  The 11th century?  The 9th.  And it would not be remiss to ask
what do the followers of Ramanuja, Madhva, and Vallabha think about the
worth of this work?  After all, they may be interpreting it wrong but they
are no less the inheritors of Vedic tradition.

However considerably more than two are silent on the matter.

Do you think His Holiness believes that ones caste is based on anything
other than birth?  If as I suspect the answer is no, then he doesn't
accept the Vajrasuchi literally.  Perhaps he has some way of reconciling
the words and the tradition but he definitely does not accept it as it is
written.  And if the muktika accepts this not to be taken at 100% face
value upanishad what does that mean?  What is that endorsement worth?

This is that either-or mentality you were previously warning against.
Between tradition and critical scholarship there is an amorphous zone of
ideas both sides take from.

Why not?  It's true.  I am but the latest link in our parampara.
Certainly as a Brahman it is my duty not only to learn all these things
for myself but to teach them to the next generation and to do that I have
to understand them.  The difference between me and Shankaracharya or
Upanishadbrahmayogin is only one of quantity not kind.  As for the muktika
I'm rejecting it as a basis for accepting an "upanishad" that expresses a
view contrary to Dharma.  If that basis is wrong it may well be possible
to accept the muktika.  We'll have to see.

But who says I want to be one!  I bring their arguments up where I think
they are germane but that doesn't imply I endorse everything that has been
said and done in the name of critical scholarship.

That isn't how I feel.  A Vedantin is a Mimamsaka.  I just think a
Mimamasaka can make use of modern scolarship.

As I said above I need not produce any such thing.  Rather the silence of
the majority of the Advaita tradition is my proof.

No confusion on my part.  It is precisely because I respect tradition that
I don't want to see texts fraudulently attach to it.

One piece of evidence is usually not enough to clinch a case but it should
make us more suspicious.

It is perhaps arbitrary.  But the difference between me and a skeptic is
my choices aren't just the product of my own mind but of all (not just
two) of those who have gone before me and their (arbitrary?) choices.

Not true.  We can look at the Upanishads Shankaracharya quotes and compare
them to these other works for content, style, terminology etc. and see if
they match.  If they do we can infer they are real also.  If not we have
good cause to believe they are not.

The _entire_ Advaita tradition.

The matter of what constitutes Shruti is more important than any darshana.
All astikas must agree on what constitutes the Vedas or none of them will
be able to use it as a pramana.

Once again let me make clear my problem with the Muktika is based on my
problem with the Vajrasuchi (specifically to one sentance in it.)  If some
way was found to remove the problem with vajrasuchi then I would have no
problem with muktika but I cannot accept any work which is contrary to
Dharma.
