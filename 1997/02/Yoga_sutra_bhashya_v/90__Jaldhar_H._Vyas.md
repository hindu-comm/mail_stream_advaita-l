As you know there are also a number of scholars who doubt the works
authenticity.  There is a synopsis of the various arguments in the
Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies edited by Karl Potter.

Oops, typo on my part.  I meant the vivarana.  (And you meant Vyasa :-)

So let me get this straight, Advaitins considered this work to be so
important it got completely lost for 1100 years?

I must confess I haven't read the work at all.  I'll take a look at
it and the other references you suggest next time I go to the
library.  Prima facie I find it hard to believe Shankaracharya would want
to comment on Patanjala Yoga considering how vehement he is against
Samkhya ideas in the BSB.  Also if did want to write about Yoga it would
have made more sense to do it in his Shrividya works.  Doesn't the
Saundarya Lahari mention some yogic concepts?
