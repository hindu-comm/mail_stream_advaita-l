The words of any Acharya whether they are of the past or of modern times,
are to be treated with the utmost reverence but any statement of theirs
that contradicts Shruti cannot be accepted as siddhanta.  This would be
the case if the literal equivalence of the dream and waking states were
accepted as the Mandukyopanishad enumerates them seperately and shruti is
not subject to the defect of redundancy.  However on closer examination we
will see  that there is no real contradiction.

If I were suggesting the waking state was real that would be a
misinterpretation.  However that isn't what I'm saying.  Both the waking
and dreaming states are unreal.  They differ in their _kind_ of unreality.
The dream objects are purely the products of the ahamkara of the individual
jiva.  (Which itself is unreal.)  The waking objects are on exactly the
same level as the jiva.

The arguments are indeed subtle and worth a look (or a second look) by
everone on the list, particularly the ones overenamored with Buddhism.
Because Shankaracharya is walking a fine line here.  He wants to refute
those who believe the world is real but doesn't want to fall into the trap
of shunyavada.  So he restates more clearly Gaudapadacharyas arguments
explaining things his paramaguru left unsaid.  Take a look at the bhashya
on II. 32 (p.257-258)  Talking about the illusion of the rope appearing as
a snake, he says the illusion does not originate from the rope or the mind
(of the jiva) or both.  When the objector says the substratum of the snake
(i.e. the rope)  is itself an illusion, he replies that the rope remains.
Actually it is the imaginer of the snake that remains.  Obviously this
imaginer is also an illusion to be dispelled but this rather harder than
looking at a piece of rope don't you think?

All the more reason to spell it out.  The phrasing of the bit you quoted
leaves room for doubt.

Perhaps I should rephrase what I said.  Swami Abhinava Vidyatirtha
Maharaj's phrasing was meant for someone who was no a scholar.
