Good point! It is quite clear that shrI sha.nkara has addressed two different
classes of people in the BSB and the upadeshasAhasrI. That is also confirmed by
advaitins of today. Instead of realizing this, arguments like "gauDapAda was
wrong" are quite ridiculous, and that too with nothing to substantiate such
arguments.

BTW, Jaldhar, Can you tell us who you learnt vedAnta from and what
authoritative text he was following and whether he had the gall to claim
gauDapAda was wrong? Initially you claimed that you had read the GK and that it
agreed with you. When I gave relevant quotations now you are actually saying
"gauDapAda was wrong".

Ramakrishnan.
