    The following verse occurs early in the first chapter. Note the
    use of the word `kriyaa' (activity) which is typically found
    in Kashmir Shaivism.

   jnaanam na chedsvayaM siddhaM jagadandhaM tamo bhavet.h |
   kriyaa na chedasya kaachit vyavahaaraH kathaM bhavet.h ||

   If Knowledge (Consciousness) were not Self-established, then
   the world would have been in darkness.
   If it were without activity, then how would there be action
   (in the world).

   I have seen some people interpret the second line as "If there were
   no activity of Ishvara, then how would there be action in the world."
                  ^^^^^^^
   This interpretation would be consistent with advaita. As you said,
   the rest of the chapter is typically advaitic and its treatment
   of the waking and dream states is similar to GauDapaada's.

  Same here. I have to find out more about Kashmir Shaivism, before I
  make further comments. I have read that Abhinavagupta did not explictly
  deny the reality of the world, as advaita does. Perhaps there is a
  connection between kriyaa being in Brahman (Shiva) and this. If Shiva
  is engaged in the activity of creation, preservation, and destruction of
  the world, then denying the reality of the world would mean denying the
  kriyaa of Shiva.

  Also, Kashmir Shaivism seems to think that advaita's calling the world
  unreal, makes the world tuchchha (insignificant). This leads to a
  negative attitude towards life.

  This criticism is probably of ideas such as the one in the following,
  a verse from Shankara's aparokshhaanubhuuti:

  brahmaadisthaavaraanteshhu vairaagyaM vishhayeshhvanu
  yathaiva kaakavishhTaayaaM vairaagyaM taddhi nirmalaM ||

  The objects of sense-enjoyment in all worlds from Brahmaloka upto
  this world should be viewed with the same indifference as one would
  view the excrement of a crow. This is pure vairaagya (dispassion).

  The criticism may be answered by noting that vairaagya has more to do with
  maintaining a neutral attitude (samachitta) towards life and not a
  negative attitude. The Giitaa talks about yadR^ichchhaalaabhasantushhTaH,
  one who is content with what he gets by chance. If there is no desire
  or passion for sense-enjoyment, then it is the same as dispassion.
