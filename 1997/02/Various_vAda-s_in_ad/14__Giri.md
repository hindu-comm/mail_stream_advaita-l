        The key word here is "some points"

        I was quoting from Prof. Nakamura of Japan. He has investigated
and written about the authencity of Shankara's vivarana of the yoga suutra
bhashya (ysb) and on the adhyatma patala of the apastamba sutra. As he
correctly notes, just because Shankara disagrees from the Samkhya
philosophy in his brahma suutra bhashya (bsb), it does not mean Shankara
disagrees with all of samkhya philosophy. Trevor Leggett points out some
research papers by western scholars who were shocked that Shankara
actually practiced some yoga, and was not just a philosopher. Any
advaitin from India will know that Shankara was not *just* a philosopher.

        And this is again obvious to anyone who has studied under a Guru
in India.

Namaste.
