Where does Gaudapada assert there are three and _only_ three states of
consciousness? The entire context of the mANDUkya upanishad and the
kArikAs is in the discussion of the turIya state.

As I see it, if a work is included in the Vani Vilas edition, it argues
for its authenticity, as far as the advaita tradition is concerned. But if
a work is not included in it, it does not mean that it is not authentic.
To the best of my knowledge, the Sringeri matha has not claimed that
_only_  the works included in the Vani Vilas edition are authentic.

Read the Upadesasahasri. There is no disagreement between Sankara and
Gaudapada in this text.

Part of the reason there seems to be diasgreement is that Sankara is
writing commentaries to various texts, and he is necessarily operating
within the parameters laid down in the source text. In the kArikAs, after
the first book, Gaudapada is pretty much writing an independent treatise
on advaita, and he is not following the issues laid down in another work.
In his independent works like the Upadesasahasri, Sankara is also not
limited by another source text, and you can see that he follows Gaudapada
closely.

Sure, but consider that the differences of opinion are rather minor and
everybody's opinions revolves around the same central thesis. The basic
issue of advaita is one of asserting "One" when confronted with the
"many". There is necessarily a leap of logic involved, and depending on
one's own logical predilections, varying conclusions may be reached. There
is nothing specifically wrong with that.
