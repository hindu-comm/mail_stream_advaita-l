No offence intended, but it is quite clear that you have no idea of what
vivarta vAda and pariNAma vAda are and it is quite clear that you have not read
the GK either. In spite of the fact that I quoted gauDapAda who is considered
the last word in the advaita circles, you are persisting in your arguments
without even making an attempt to read either gauDapAda or his interpretation
by sha.nkara.

I'll post an answer if you make an attempt to read the works of the two prime
AchArya-s I quoted. Let me leave it at that.

Ramakrishnan.
