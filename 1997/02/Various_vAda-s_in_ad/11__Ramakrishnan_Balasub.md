No difference. gauDpAda has shown the way with shruti and reason and hence he
_is_ the last word. Perhaps since you have not been in India you may not know
that in the advaitic circles gauDapAda is indeed considered the last word
precisely because of this very reason. One should not forget to mention  his
asparsha yoga also.

Well, pariNAma and vivarta vAda-s are completely different and you could
hardly call pariNAma vAda a subtle modification of the latter.

You are utterly confusing the bhAmati with what vivarta vAda means. vivarta
vAda in fact preceded pariNAma vAda (gauDapAda talks nothing other than vivarta
vAda).

I am afraid you do have some news to hear. pariNAma and vivarta vAda-s are
quite different and it's quite fanciful to say that the former is a subtle
modification of the latter to safeguard vedic tenets. I have no use for the
views of Western scholars on gauDapAda and buddhism. The sub-commentary to
vyAsa's commentary on the pata.njali sutra-s attributed to sha.nkara is
considered a genuine work, even by the ever-doubting Western scholars. In this
sha.nkara _openly_ disagrees with both pata.njali and vyAsa on some points.
If he disagreed with gauDapAda he'd have made no bones about it, he has made no
bones disagreeing with the commentary attributed to vyAsa. Before some of the
non-advaitins think that sha.nkara was against vyAsa's views in general, I'll
clarify that this is not so. The disagreements are points where the pata.njala
school and the advaita school disagree.

Misunderstandings of the sort like "subtle modification" etc is what happens
if one has the "either in or out mentality" (criticism of Western scholars by a
Japanese Indologist, thanks to Giri for the quote). The Japanese scholar also
recognizes, no doubt because he is from the East, that what is said is with the
disciple's capability in mind.

The same point has been repeated by shrI abhinava vidyAtIrtha mahAsvAmigaL and
I prefer to believe that since it seems more logical to me than some vague
explanations that vivarta became pariNAma (when in fact the two are utterly
different!), gauDapAda flirted with the buddhists and such. Indologists are
also slowly, but surely recognizing the fact that there are various teachings
given to people of various capabilities.

I was tied up with work for some time, but all points which I wished to make
have been said and this will be my last post on this. You should either re-read
all the books which you say you have read, more carefully, or get some
proper scholar to explain to you the differences between pariNAma and vivarta
vAda-s.

Primary text for vivarta vAda: mANDUkya upanishhad and the kArikA-s.
Primary text for pariNAma vAda: pa.nchadasI of shrI vidyAraNya.

But note that even shrI vidyAraNya recognized that vivarta vAda was equally
valid (if not more) by writing a commentary on the yoga vAsishhTa (vivarta vAda
text).
