You are right. I should have made it clear. gauDapAda declares that the truth
is that there is no birth or ajAti. But DSV and SDV are both only theories of
creation. The point was whether DSV is acceptable or not. gauDpAda gives DSV
for those who cannot get beyond the notion of causality as the "best"
explanation, since it agrees with reasoning and shruti. Other wise there would
be no point in going through the analysis of the states and so on.

Both DSV and SDV agree that the final truth is only ajAti.

Ramakrishnan.
