Let me give you an example of what I mean.  Gaudapadacharya at one point
refers to Jnanis as Buddhas.  If his work is the "last word" why has no
later Advaitin picked up his terminology?  One obvious reason is that
people might get confused and think he was refering to a Tathagata when
really we know he is just using it as a generic term for a wise man.

I don't believe I was.  For me the issue is quite simple.  The Shruti
explicitly says there are _four_ states of consciousness.  For
Gaudapadacharya  to assert there are  three because two of them are the
same can only lead to two conclusions.

1.  Shruti is wrong.

Which is completely untenable. Or

2.  Gaudapadacharya is wrong.

Which might be ok with some Vedantins but is not acceptable to us who
belong to the Advaita parampara.

So the various theories come up to explain discrepancies and not all come
to the same conclusions.  We do not have to accept every crackpot idea
that comes along but neither do we have to believe in exactly one idea.

Neither do I.  It doesn't mean I want to be ignorant of them though.  And
the charge of crypto-buddhism was hardly invented in modern times.

Who exactly?  Hacker did but I don't think the consensus is in favor of
the works authenticity.  Indians aren't free of doubt either.  The
Yogasutrabhashya isn't in the Vani Vilas edition which was hardly
motivated by western interests.

Then again I ask you why hasn't Shankaracharya adopted the terminology of
his paramguru?  Why is his emphasis on different issues?  One doesn't need
to get into a violent argument to disagree with someone.  There are
subtler ways.  The fact that cannot be ignored is there are differences of
opinion betweendifferent figures in the Advaita parampara.  There can
hardly be differences of opinion if everyone believes exactly the same
thing.

Nothing I've said contradicts the notion that there are different teachings
for disciples at different levels.
