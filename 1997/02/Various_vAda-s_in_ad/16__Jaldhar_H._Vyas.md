Remember how this whole thing started?  An assertion was made that the
waking state and the dream were at the same metaphysical plane of reality.
(Actually non-reality.)  I pointed out that this cannot be right as shruti
enumerates them seperately and it would be guilty of redundancy if it
spoke of four when there were really three.  Gaudapadacharya was brought
into the picture to defend the idea that dream and reality are the same.
I then pointed out that even if he did believe that (which I don't believe
for a minute.) this view was discarded by the mainstream of later Advaita
tradition.  I see no evidence in the Upadesha Sahasri that Shankaracharya
supported the idea that is being ascribed to Gaudapadacharya and I think
the Bhashya on Brahma Sutra III. 2. pretty much says the opposite.  So to
sum up the position I'm defending.  Both the dream and waking states are
unreal but they are not the same kind of unreality.

What I'm saying is the reading of Gaudapadacharya that makes him say that
the world is literally a dream (i.e metaphysically the same as a dream) is
rejected by the mainstream Advaita tradition.  That idea is problematic as
it is redolent of Buddhism.  I don't believe that's what Gaudapadacharya
meant and it's possible to interpret his words differently.  In fact I
believe Shankaracharya did just that.  (I also think paranthetically that
Shankaracharya distances himself somewhat from the style, not neccessarily
the substance of his Paramaguru.)

If you say the waking world is like a dream I have no problem.  It is only
the idea the world is literally a dream I object to.
