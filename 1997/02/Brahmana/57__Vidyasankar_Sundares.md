Maybe, but the fact remains that nobody has prohibited those of kshatriya
or vaishya descent from the use of the mantra, or the study of the Vedas.
Nobody has specifically said that the Gayatri mantra and the study of the
Vedas are restricted to Brahmanas only. You may remember that
Suresvaracharya explicitly says this as the reason why sannyasa is
open to all dvijas. Actually, if you look closely enough, you will find
many people identified with the kshatriya subcastes, especially from
Bengal and Orissa, who still chant the mantra. From other regions of
India, even if they do not chant it daily, people do use it on ceremonial
occassions.
