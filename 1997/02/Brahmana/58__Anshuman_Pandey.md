More accurately, the spelling should be braahmaaNa. But that's just a
transliterary technicality, entirely dependent on convention!

The vajrasuci upaniShad is counted as one of the "official" 112
upaniShad-s. Are you confusing shruti and smR^iti? There is no shruti
that states that braahmaNa-hood is attainable through birth only. If I am
mistaken, please correct me by providing the references. In verse 4.13 of
the bhagavadgiitaa, kR^iShNa states:

"caaturvarNyaM mayaa sR^iShTaM guNakarmavibhaagashaH"
These four orders were created by me according to quality and work.

Unless you consider the bhagavadgiitaa to be a forgery, the above points
to the caste system as having been established upon duty rather than by
birth. It is most likely the case that the caste-by-birth "standard"
evolved out of this.
