Of course.  But one should at least attempt to be accurate shouldn't they?
As I remarked to Giri, Gujaratis leave off the ending 'a' on words (which
is why I'm Jaldhar not Jaladhara. So Brahman is more accurate for me.
(And this is why I don't complain when the Southerners say Gayathri when
they obviously mean Gayatri :-)

Bhagavadgita being part of the Mahabharata is a Smriti not Shruti.  And if
the shloka you quote is to be taken literally, why is Arjuna referred to
as a Kshatriya?  Surely no one is more deserving of being called a Brahman
(according to your definition) than one who has learnt from Krishna
Bhagawan himself?
