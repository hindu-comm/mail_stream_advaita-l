        Huh ? IF a brahmin (brahmana) loses his brahmin-hood by crossing
the ocean, then your parents have lost it by crossing the ocean by coming
to the west. If you are born to parents who are not brahmins, you cannot
be a brahmin. This is, of course, based on the dharma-sastra definition
of brahmin. As Shruti, for example vajrasuchi upanishad, clearly states
only a person who knows (Atman/Brahman) is a Brahmin.

Namaste.
