 Lord Shiva appears handsome in the upper garment made from the hide of
 an elephant. His lotus feet are worshipped by Lord Brahma and
 Lord Vishnu. His has matted locks of hair that are cooled by the waters of
 the Gangaa, the river of the Gods and Siddhas. I seek refuge in that
 Chandrashekhara. What will Death do to me?
