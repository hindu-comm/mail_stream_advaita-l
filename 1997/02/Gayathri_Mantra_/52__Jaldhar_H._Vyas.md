Whether they are late or not is immaterial from the Dharmic point of view.
Diwali didn't exist in Vedic times either.  We have no conception in the
shastras of Vedic times.  The Vedas are eternally valid.  The Smritis
which do not oppose the Vedas are eternally valid and Shishtachara or
traditional practices which do not oppose Shruti and Smriti are eternally
valid.

I find that difficult to belive.  Because for one thing you don't need to
cross the sea to get to Burma from Bengal.  And what exactly do you mean
by Brahman members of the Bengal Army?  Somebody whose job is to kill
others doesn't have the requisite gunas and karma you claim a Brahman
needs yet you still refer to them as Brahmans.  (As does everyone else.)

This is irrelevant.  Bhaktivedanta wasn't a Smarta and the other two
weren't particularly knowledgeable about Dharmic matters.

No.
