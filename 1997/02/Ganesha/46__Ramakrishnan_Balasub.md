They still don't have it (as of Jan 1997). In fact I took a look at their
catalog which lists all their present publications and the English translation
of the shaiva upanishhad-s is not available. The Sanskrit version with Upanishad
brahma yogin's commentary is available.

There are a lot of other interesting works on mantra shastra etc which are
available in this store. If anyone goes to Madras and are interested in this
kind of stuff, please check the place out.

Ramakrishnan.
