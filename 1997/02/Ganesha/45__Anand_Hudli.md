   I liked the spirit in which the author has written the book. It is very
   different from the usual "cold, scientific" attitude shown by
   scholars. In fact, Grimes is able to reconcile everything in the
   Vedas, and the PuraaNas too, with his own thinking. He narrates
   every detail of legends about Ganesha and His devotees with great
   devotion. The reader cannot but be touched by this aspect.
