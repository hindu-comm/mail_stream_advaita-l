Does Advaita have all these rules and reguations for the society ?!
Kindly separate the two. Society and its behavior is one
and Advaita is the other, one enveloped by the other, not otherwise,
neither one to one.

Advaita has nothing to do with what you eat, what you chant,
whether you are from the eastern part of the ocean or western,
whether you are a householder or a sannyasi or a middleman.
Advaita is not the ways of `so called Advaitins'.

If there is a mistake made 1000 years ago, it has to be cleared.
My feeling is that Buddha did not accept the Vedas for similar reasons.
