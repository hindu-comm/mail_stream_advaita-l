No he meant until you do not have any responsibilities.  There's a big
difference.  It's only the uneducated modern Gurus who encourage people to
be irresponsible layabouts.  Advaita has always strongly upheld the Astika
Vedic Dharma.  Either one should live the householders life or one should
renounce it entirely.  There is no room for those who try and do both as
they tend to end up doing neither.

This is fine and proper. But it is not sufficient for samadhi which is
incompatible with worldly life.

One should take a good look at oneself and decide what they are capable
of.  If the pull of samsara is there one should practice the duties
enjoined in the karma kanda not deviating by one letter.  If there are no
attachments one should renounce everything.

Nageshwar Rao is one of the truly blessed people on this Earth that he has
faith in Mataji and someone who can give him good advice.  it would be a
great shame if he was led astray by faulty conclusions.
