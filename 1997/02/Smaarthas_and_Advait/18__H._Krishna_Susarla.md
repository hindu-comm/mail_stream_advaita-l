Can anyone provide a definition of the term "smaartha" and its relation to
advaita? I understand that smaarthas are caste braahmins who practice
advaita. Is this essentially correct? Are all smaarthas advaitists by
definition? Does the term smaarthas apply only to those who are
householders, or is it used to describe sannyaasis and brahmacaaris as
well?

thanks in advance,

-- K
