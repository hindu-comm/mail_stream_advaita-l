Thank you.

No. The mAdhva-s find fault with the advaitins for telling that this sentence
is important. It is explained by the presence of a silent "a" like the p in
psychiatrist. It is just another sentence in the shruti (all of us of course
know that _all_ sentences explain bheda only).

Negative remarks and positive remarks can be interpreted. Silence can only be
ignored since arguments can be given both ways. Since none of them condemned it
it may or may not be accepted, but that cannot be decided on the basis of
anyone's silence.

What do you mean by face value? Each interpreter thinks his interpretation is
the "face value". Even "(a)tattvamasi" is taken as the face value
interpretation by some. So one cannot argue against the muktika on basis of
this. If you noticed something, I never commented about the interpretation of
the vajrasUchi. I only objected to your methodology of comparing with smR^iti
texts to claim that this is a forgery. There may be a straightforward way to
reconcile the smR^iti texts and this upanishhad for all I know.

No. Here we are talking vedAnta or not. This is not a teaching for different
kinds of students based on their competence.

I am also not interested in what the mAdhva-s or the shrI vaishhhNava-s have to
say about the 108 upanishhads. I merely said that _in_ the advaitic tradition
these have been handed down as shruti and count as such. Ananda tIrtha quotes
passages from things like the brahma tarka, parama upanisshad etc. I don't care
two hoots for any of these texts and similarly I will stick to the principal
upanishhad-s if I am talking to any non-advaitin. The mAdhva-s are welcome to
consider those (brahma tarka etc) as shruti, but they cannot quote those texts
to prove something to advaitins. Similarly no advaitic teacher will quote
anything other than about 15-20 standard upanishhad-s which everyone seems to
accept. The point here is what the advaitic tradition accepts as shruti.

?!!! Let me clarify. I am _not_ interested in hearing your ad-hoc statements and
they certainly don't count as tradition. After the misunderstanding you
displayed about brahma loka (your exchange with Giri), you can hardly call
yourself even a scholar. The "te brahma loketu parAntakAle parimuchyanti sarve"
is in fact one of the most famous statements, in fact. That being the case,
claiming that the "difference between me and Shankaracharya ... is only one of
quantity ... " is ridiculous, to say the least.

Really! Then who is the modern jaimini who gives us how much of "modern
scholarship" we should accept and how much we shouldn't? Of course the part of
the "modern scholarship" which calls the veda-s as written will be avoided.
Pray, is it you by any chance, who is going to take up the monumental task of
forming this navya pUrva mImA.nsA?

No. As I said, silence is never a proof for anything (as per mImA.nsA at any
rate). If you can talk some sense, quoting relevant authorities like a
traditional advaitin, I am willing to discuss. But most certainly not to the
delusions of grandeur which you have been displaying.

Ramakrishnan.
