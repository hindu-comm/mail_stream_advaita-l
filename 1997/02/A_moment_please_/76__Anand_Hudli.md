This is in response to Jaldhar's message about smriti and shishhTaachaara
which I mistakenly did not save.

According to the Smriti's a girl should be given away in marriage
at or before she reaches puberty. But the legal age of marriage in India
is now 18. So it would be illegal in most cases, if the Smriti were
to be followed to the letter. But there is a "way out." There are
praayashchitta's mentioned to expiate the sin of marrying a girl who
has past the age of puberty. If it be said that as long as we do the
praayashchitta's, it is Ok to break the Smriti rule, then we are still
breaking the spirit of the Smriti rule. If the praayashchitta becomes
a routine case rather than a rare one, then what is the use of the rule?
We might as well say that we can change the original rule to saying that
girls can be married at any time after the age of 18 and include the
praayashchitta as a part of the rule itself. This is what I was talking
about.
