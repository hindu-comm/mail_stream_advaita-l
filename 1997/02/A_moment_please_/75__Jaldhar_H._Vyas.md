And what I'm unable to understand is some people like to pretend the caste
system doesn't exist.  It should be obvious to anyone who has seen, been
to or even heard of Hinduism that this is what our people do.

 These

Especially the what not.

they still didn't come out of one

You can answer that question yourself.  Go back and look at the archives
of this list and tell me who is saying that.

The Vedas, yes, are only for Brahmans.  But the Puranas, Smritis etc.
contain the essence of the Vedas and are open to all.

No.

No.

You are entitled to think whatever you like and respect whoever you like
but it is of no concern to anyone else.  Especially if your basis for
doing so is based on a complete misconception.  So go or stay it's up to
you.

You should have asked your question.  You would have gotten an answer
perhaps one you would have been pleasantly surprised by.  But I guess
you'll never know being so adamant against learning something new.
Personally I'm on this list because I learn something new from everyone I
correspond with--even the ones I'm 180 degrees in opposition to.  (It's
called open-mindedness.)

If your arguments are true, how come Sankaracharya even considered

Because Shankaracharya had a brain in his head.  We all have brains and
the intent is for us to use them.  We have to consider every new idea that
comes along measure it against the yardstick of the shastras and logic and
*then* reject it if it doesn't fit.

Most of Shankaracharyas works consist of polemics against other darshanas.
