Please take heart.  Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Yogananda, Ananda Mayee Ma,
the sage of Arunachala, among many others, made it quite clear that meeting
stringent standards regarding provisional, cultural, sectarian, racial, as
well as gender- and caste-oriented factors as prerequisites to the sadhana
for Brahmajnana, is a critical misrepresentation.  All that's required is
a sincere desire or, as you say, thirst for knowledge (mumukshutva) to search
for the sathya [that lies within].

Here's a case where shruti is noncommittal and smriti is critically vital.

Namaste.
