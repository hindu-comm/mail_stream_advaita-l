Advaita is very clear about the status of smriti too.  Smriti that is
based on Shruti is just as valid.  Only if there is a conflict between
Shruti and Smriti can Smriti be overridden.  In fact most of the common
practices of Hindus today are based on Smriti not Shruti.

This isn't quite correct either.  Yes, our understanding of tradition is
mediated by Shishtachara but this doesn't mean any fad that happens to be
in vogue at a given time or place.  A shishta is an elder like a father,
mother or teacher.  As long they do not contradict shruti and smriti their
words have equal sanctity to the Vedas.  But if they do, they are to be
rejected.  For instance until recently "educated" people believed in
socialism.  (Unfortunately some of the more benighted Indians still do.)
I don't know about anyone else but I didn't modify my religion to fit
someone elses daydream.
