Since my recent post is included in your post, I presume you mean the
above statements about me?

Please note that I have avoided getting into this caste discussion, except
to point out that,

1. Gayatri mantra is not for Brahmanas only, it is meant for all who have
the proper initiation, i.e. the yajnopavIta, and

2. If your approach to advaita is as vedAnta, in addition to philosophical
interest, then the authority of the Vedas is paramount. There is no point
in quoting "tattvamasi" from the upanishads, if one holds that the
upanishads themselves become irrelevant or unauthoritative because of
current societal conditions.

To me, it does not matter if a person is born to Brahmana parents or not,
or whether one is a man or a woman, as far as the thirst for knowledge is
concerned. Be that as it may, the varNASrama system has existed in India
for centuries, and advaita vedAnta and vedAntins have coexisted with it
for all these centuries. Except in the recent past, sannyasis belonging to
the larger advaita fold have not felt the need to reform or change the
social system around them.

Teachers of advaita take mantropadeSa seriously. They also take
adhikAra-bheda seriously. There are numerous mantras which they regard as
suitable for those who do not undergo yajnopavIta initiation. The powerful
SrIvidyA mantra is open to all, so are the mantras on Siva and vishNu. But
they are not out to change society, by waiving the requirement of a proper
yajnopavIta for the gAyatrI mantra. By their very nature, true sannyasis
renounce society and its relationships, including that of caste.

The recent discussion was about losing one's caste upon migrating
overseas, and for expiations to this. It was not about moksha at all. The
very question about sin and expiations presumed difference, between a home
land and an alien land that one has settled in. It also assumed that one
had a caste, which was given by birth. In my opinion, the discussion had
nothing to do with knowledge or liberation. If your point is that the
discussion was ultimately fruitless, I agree with you. But please do not
draw wrong conclusions about eligibility for moksha from it.

Sincerely,
Vidyasankar
