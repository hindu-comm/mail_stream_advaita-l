Namaste,
        All that you say is true for a person who has an intense desire to
"know" the paramAtmA.  For such a person the difficulty is that he
can be wrapped up in pursuit of desires arising due to a particular
circumstance.  Then, at that moment, all wisdom is lost and he sacrifices
his longterm motives for satisfying his "hunger". If however such a person
is aware of his ego self he is able to rise above the circumstance. For
such a person there is no repression of desires, infact there is no
control either.  There is just a sense of "knowing the finer parts of the
machinery".  As he recognizes this, detachment automatically builds in.
        For a person who has no such objectives of knowing the true self,
the moment with its "offerings" holds great importance.  For him his ego
is all there is, and the needs to satisfy it are real. There is therefore
repression and all the associated psychological problems.

Regards,
Prashant.
