>From the vyavaharika (relative) perspective, it seems when attempting
the best interpretation of the [real] parabrahman sthiti, the closest
one can get to describing it is through satchidananda, which is really
stipulated/asserted via the double negative: viz. not non-being, not
non-consciousness, not non-bliss.  Being yet an attribute, it defies
positive assertion, like any other concept.  This is extremely subtle
and if one catches the drift of this dynamic: ie how virtually *all*
concepts (vritti-s) require complete integration into the Whole of
the Absolute, the source of sathya must be delivered like a current
dissolving the fallacy of the *separative* jiva--which exists nowhere
in space-time except as a dream-dance of maya.

Namaste.
