This sounds pretty good and tight except for one silly little quibble.

Aren't "Atman", "maya", "ego", "intellect", "object of cognition", "act of
cognition", etc. *all* concepts?  Can we (or anyone) conceive of what is
ontologically prior to the arising of concepts? In the abscence of conceptual
distinctions, is there any "Atman" as opposed to "maya"?  I say no. There
is certainly not nothing but that non-nothing is hardly conceivable either.

If anyone takes up the position prior to the arising of conceptual thought,
they will also find themselves prior to language and might therefore have a
difficult time arguing this point. (perhaps *impassioned* arm waving might
be attempted however  :-)

If anyone does take up the position prior to the arising of conceptual
thought, please don't let anyone's ego talk you out of it. IMO, only this
is Brahman (Tao, Godhead, The One, Truth, etc.) and I bow to it again and
again, my friend. The rest is just a rumor, "forget about it".   :-)

P.S.

Yes, what I am saying is prior to the arising of conceptual thought is
undoubtedly present periodically in all 3 states.  Are we actually talking
about the same thing here, or is there something other than "the single
Atman" which exists in all 3 states?
