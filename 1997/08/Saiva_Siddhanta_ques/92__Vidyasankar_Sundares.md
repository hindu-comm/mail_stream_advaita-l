Yes, the l(n)akUlISa pASupata system is found in many of the Agamas.
Actually, many of the authors of the nyAya school of logic were pASupata
by religion. So, although the pASupatas seem to be generally extinct,
their influence is seen in many Saiva schools. There are many Siva temples
in Tamil Nadu, which are described as kAyArohaNa temples, which have some
connection to pASupata teachers.
