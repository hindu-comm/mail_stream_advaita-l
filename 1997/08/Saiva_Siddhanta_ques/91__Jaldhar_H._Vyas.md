Is this the same as the Pashupata darshan mentioned by Madhavacharya and
in the Puranas?  It's founder was one Lakulish or Nakulish who is said to
be an avatar of Shiva Bhagavan in the Shiva Purana.  One thing I remember
reading about them was they were all sannyasis and they believed in
seperating from the world by causing people to despise and censure them.[1]
Anyway this darshan is supposedly extinct now[2] which is why I found your
comment of interest.

[1] The reason I remember is because one of the methods suggested for
doing this was to burp loudly in mandir!

[2] Though the Pashupata Sutras and commentary have been published I
think.
