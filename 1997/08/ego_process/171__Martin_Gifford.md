Things happen slowly in the physical plane. The infant human is utterly
vulnerable. It takes 15 years of solid conditioning to be able to cope. The
birth process is difficult and painful. The brains tendency is to focus on
survival at all costs. Our species killed every other competing species to
become the dominant species.

Now this means that suffering has been an unavoidable by-product to reach
where we are - the point of being able to fully create and experience on the
physical plane. The brains habit of focusing on objects for survival leads
to the duality of subject and object as separate. The next step is to
realise non-duality.

Another way of looking at it is that the body is like a space suit for
experiencing the physical plane. Holes in space suits and problems with
space ships are natural and to be expected. Many astronauts have taken the
risk of accidents because they thought it was worth it. And it was! As our
understanding grows we fix the problems.

It seems to me if we accept the idea of limitations on the physical plane it
explains the dichotomy of wanting to be happy yet creating suffering. Or the
idea of a loving god vs suffering creation.

I hope this makes some sense. I'm finding it hard to express this idea
clearly but I keep trying.
