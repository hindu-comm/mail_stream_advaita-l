Maybe we should just leave Osho alone.

Maybe we need to stop trying to discover who Osho is/was
          and focus, instead, on discovering who WE are.

It's all only the Self, anyway, isn't it?

 And the Self never takes a "position" about anything.


                                      With Blessings,

                                             Chuck Hillig
