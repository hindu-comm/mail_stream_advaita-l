According to that view the answer would have to be either no or don't
care.  Remember it is only since the 19th century that any human culture
has thought of itself as being universal.  Even though Christians and
Muslims not to mention various other religions have lived amongst Hindus
for centuries a look at history shows Vedantins have never made much of an
attempt to reach out to others.  This is a question that simply was not
on the minds of the authorities of the past except in an abstract,
theoretical sense.

If one did think about it, I suppose the conclusion would be as
enlightenment is achieved with the same rational faculties all humans
posess, all humans should be able to achieve it.
