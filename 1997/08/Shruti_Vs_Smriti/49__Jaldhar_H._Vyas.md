Your reading is pointless but one day it could lead to something so in
that sense it is worth continuing.  That's how I characterize my study of
Vedanta too.  There are far more practical things I read such as vyakarana
but one day when I do take sannyasa knowledge of Vedanta will be
indispensable.

I think the first view would more accurately called fundamentalist.  It
takes one passage from one work (which isn't even about caste) out of
context and attempts to craft a theory out of it.  The idea that caste is
based on birth isn't just a matter of ideology it is the historical truth.

That is indeed the way Indians understand caste.
