Bear in mind you are reading translations.  I don't know Swami
Prabhavanandas credentials beyond he was associated with Christopher
Isherwood (which isn't much of a recommendation) but Rajagopalachari was a
politician in the early days of India.  How do you know he didn't censor
his translation to fit his political agenda?

The Upanishads are the jnana kanda of the Vedas.  They are meant for
Sannyasis only.  The Karma kanda of the Vedas like the Gita is
meant for householders and contains just as many "life-affirming"
statements.  However the Advaita tradition is very firm that Moksha
requires Sannyasa.  The teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads
do not diverge on this.

The Shruti is only meant for men of the Brahman, Kshatriya, and Vaishya
varnas so why would it mention anyone else?  For the benefit of others
Maharshi Veda Vyas took the essence of the Shruti and wrote the Mahabharat
(of
which the Bhagavad Gita is a part) and the 18 Puranas.

Brahma.

??? Part of the problem might be that Brahma (a masculine noun meaning the
Creator God), Brahman (a neuter noun meaning the Supreme), and Brahman (a
masculine noun meaning a man of the priestly caste) all share much od
their declensions.  Brahma could refer to the Creator or a priest in the
nominative case or the Supreme Being in the accusative case.  This is not
a big deal most of the time for someone who understands Sanskrit grammer
but an ignorant translator may screw things up.

The Bhagavad Gita is hardly an argument against caste.  Krishna Bhagavan
forces Arjuna to fight even though he doesn't want to precisely because
_he_is_a_Kshatriya_.

Shruti and Smriti both teach the same thing.  The only time Shruti takes
precedence is when there is a contradiction between the two and here there
is no contradiction.
