which directly contradicts what shrI gauDapAda or shrI sha.nkara say.
Ramana Maharshi is also quite emphatic that there is no perception of
duality for a GYAni. It is only people who see GYAni-s who raise such
questions and think that GYAni-s perceive duality. There is an
explanation based on the dual role of mAyA, to show how GYAni-s seem to
perceive duality, however such explanations are meant only for the
aGYAni-s who keep getting doubts about the state of a GYAni.
