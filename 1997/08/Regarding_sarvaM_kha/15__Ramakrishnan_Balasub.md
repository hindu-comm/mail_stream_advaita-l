I haven't read the vishhNu purANa. It's on the top on my of list of
things to read. However, the interpretation you give directly
contradicts shruti.

The MU says that turIya is

avyavahAram agrAhyam achintyaM ...

Note that turIya is avyavahAraM! For example if you say that the blue
Lotus is brahman, then does it mean brahman is blue? Not so, for brahman
is agrAhyaM. Is there a real transformation of brahman into the blue
Lotus? Not so, for the bR^ihadAraNyaka upanishhad says that "Indra
through _mAyA_ assumes diverse forms. Thus it is not the blue Lotus
which is brahman, but rather the substratum (adhishhThAna) behind the
illusion of the blue Lotus, which is brahman.

Note that the same MU says:

sarvaM hi etad brahma: all these are verily brahman

Thus the way to understand the MU is that the world as you preceive it
is _NOT_ brahman, but once established in turIya the substratum alone is
"seen" and then what was perceived before, i.e., the "all" is brahman.
In Atma bodha shrI sha.nkara says exactly the same thing. Please consult
this book.

Conception implies duality. This is a standard practice encouraged in
sAdhaka-s to get rid of their attachments to the object of senses. It
has no bearing with reality.

There is no paradox.

I don't see the connection. As per advaita, the last sentence should be
"after advaita siddhi, there are neither mountains nor rivers, but only
brahman".
