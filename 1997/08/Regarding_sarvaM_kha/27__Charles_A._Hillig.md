Hi  Jaldhar,

     The very quintessence of the Self/guru/God is this pure love, itself.
As they say, "Love is all there is."   In a sense, we are all swimming in
love as Love loves Itself.

     Because the Self is always whole and complete in its absolute totality,
it needs no so-called "others" to exist in order to trigger this love.

     Love is what IT is all about!


                                          With Blessings,

                                              Chuck Hillig
