I shall try and explain why it does not.

This interpretation, which has taken the words "avyavahAraM agrAhyaM achintyaM"
literally would leave Brahman mired in the duality of "vyavahAraM-avyavahAraM"
"chintyaM-achintyaM" etc.

And the mANDukya KArikA emphasizes the non-duality of Brahman by not even
allowing it the duality of "asti" and "na asti."

Which can only mean that such characterization as achintyam.h is *strictly*
provisional.

Bluness, lotusness, etc are properties. All properties belong to the domain of
duality. When Brahman is meditated upon as not having properties at all, the
Sadhaka arrives at the truth "Everything is Brahman."

It would mean that there is something that is _not_ Brahman: the perceived
reality.

Which would only imply that Brahman exists as separate from the perceived
reality. And Brahman would cease to be "Everything."

Shankara says that Brahman is of the nature of perception itself. It is
therefore "One with all that is perceived."

As I had quoted before, Parasara says:

"The stars are Vishnu; forests, mountains, regions, rivers, oceans are Vishnu:
 He is all that is, all that is not."

If the stars and mountains are perceived as such, there is no Vishnu, for
we see the *diversity* of stars and mountains, and Vishnu is partless.

If the stars and mountains are not perceived at all, it would make no sense to
speak of the diversity of stars, mountains, etc.

The only meaning is this:

*Everything* and *Everything else* is only Brahman.
