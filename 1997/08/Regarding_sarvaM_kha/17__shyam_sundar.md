I feel that perception of duality is not the problem. It is attributing
reality to this that is samsara. Pratyaksha and other pramanams
excluding Vedanta report only duality. Going to a particular "state"
like samadhi may give an experience of non-duality but this can't be the
goal. The truth of Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma should exist as a vritti in
the mind even while perceiving duality. Only then jivanmukthi has its
fun.The jnani too perceives the world, knowing fully well that he is the
adhishtanam.
"maieva sakalam jatam
 mayi sarvam pratishtitam
 mayi sarvam layam yati
 tat brahmadvayam asmyaham- Kaivalyopanishad"
or as Shankara says in Bhaja Govindam:
Yogaratho va bhogaratho va
Sangaratho va sanga vihinah
yasya Brahmani ramate chittam
nandati nandati nandateva.

Shyam
