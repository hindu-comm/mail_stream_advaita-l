Their is a certain similarity up to a point.  The koan is describing
whatever the zen equivalant of a jivanamukta is.  For a jivanmukta in
Vedanta, still affected by the last remnants of karma there may still be
mountains and rivers but the difference is after death.  for the Buddhist
being a nihilist there is nirvana ("extinguishing") that's it.  But the
Vedantin is fully identified with Brahman.  There are no mountains, no
rivers nothing but Brahman.
