Dear friends,

You might remember my earlier postings about the Atirudra Mahayajnam that
will start this week at the Sringeri Sadhana Center, Stroudsburg,
Pennsylvania. For those of us who cannot attend, parts of this event will
be available online, at

<http://www.asanet.com/sringeri>.

This www site has been put together very nicely, and promises to carry
daily updates, beginning August 22, carrying various sights and sounds of
this great Vedic ritual.

Vidyasankar
