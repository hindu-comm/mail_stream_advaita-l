  SOme one asked me this question, help me to answer.....

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Why do people find it so difficult to accept that once you are dead then
that is it. Instead of accepting that, we devise elaborated theories of
reincarnation and a heaven or hell (apparently sinners need to go some
where too). It seems that humans have still not accepted their
mortality, and stubbornly refuse to do so.
