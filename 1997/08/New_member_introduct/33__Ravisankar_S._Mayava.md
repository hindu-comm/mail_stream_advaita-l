Ravi,
Thank you for adding me to your list. Most of my training has been in the
Buddhist and Christian traditions.However I feel it is a mistake to limit
our search.I hope to learn much from you and hopefully I will find
Something to offer in a small way.I meditate in the zen style and
have done so for nearly 30 years. I practice Tai Chi in a small way.
I have been an RN for many years and encourage my patients to
be aware of alternate health systems.Enough about me. Thank you again.
                                                           Blessings,
                                                           James
