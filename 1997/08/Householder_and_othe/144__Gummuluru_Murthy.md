Shri Giri, in his latest posting, refers to Shri Shankara's analysis of
Bhagavadgita. It is always a pleasure to see reference to Shri Shankara's
works because, as my writings throughout the past year indicate, I have
the utmost reverence to Shri Shankara as a paramaachaarya.

No one has doubted the necessity of renunciation in attaining jnana. The
question under discussion is sannyasa **ashrama** (i.e. taking the vows of
sannyasa and announcing to the world that X has renounced everything) and
whether it is more conducive to attaining jnana.

What I am saying is: unless the mind is ready, be the individual an
announced sannyasi or an announced grihastha, nothing happens. It is
no more easy for a sannyasi in an ochre robe but with an impure and
unready mind to get avidya removed than for a grihastha (again with an
impure and unready mind).

I think I have expressed my view clear enough on this matter. The
discussion on this topic, from my personal participation point, has
gone as far as it can go. I am grateful to Shri Giri for his contribution
and wish him peace of mind and serenity in his new place.

Regards
Gummuluru Murthy

When all the desires that dwell in the heart fall away, then the mortal
becomes immortal, and attains Brahman even here.
