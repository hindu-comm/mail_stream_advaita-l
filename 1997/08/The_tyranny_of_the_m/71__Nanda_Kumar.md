The album, I suppose, refers to the past experiences. OK, it might be true
that we might perceive or react to situations based on past experiences
which might not be original or true to the moment. But the first experience
must have been original and true. So if the situation is quite the same or
similar, why not avail  the benefit of the past experience and improvise
as befits the situation, instead of reinventing the wheel? By ignoring past
experience, aren't we supressing the only tool we have - Reason, for
when faced with a similar situation, reason would point to past
experiences for a solution. And doesn't it contradict Advaita itself, which
places so much emphasis on reason and logic?
