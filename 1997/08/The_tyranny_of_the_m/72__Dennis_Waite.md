The situation now can *never* be the same as the past experience. Nothing is
the same. Our body and mind have changed along with the rest of the
(illusory) world. As the Watts extract points out, too, our memory is a
present memory of the past experience and is itself unreliable as a record
of 'the right way to behave'. What we must rely on is that our experience
has transformed what was previously information or theory into knowledge and
that the essence of that has become part of our nature as wisdom. If we face
what is in front of us in the moment without any thought, if this
assimilated 'wisdom' is appropriate, it will be there, as part of our
nature, and its applicability will be recognised by buddhi and action will
follow naturally.

I don't see any contradiction as far as advaita is concerned. I believe the
description I have given (working of manas, buddhi etc. ) is an advaita
description.
