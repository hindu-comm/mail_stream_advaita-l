I don't think so.  Which verse are you quoting?

I would agree with that.

Let's think about it.  What defines a householder?  family, a job, social
responsibilities.  Can any of these be done in a selfless way?  I think
not.  Imagine a parent for instance who didn't care if his children came
home at night or not.  He would be condemned as irresponsible not hailed
as a sannyasi.
