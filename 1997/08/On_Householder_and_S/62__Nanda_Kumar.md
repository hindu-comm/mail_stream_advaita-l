Doesn't the ISHA Upanishad say, "Renunciation is not the renunciation
of the world, rather the renunciation of the Ego and selfishness" ?
How exactly would you define Sanyaasi? If a Sanyaasi can be defined
as a person who is entirely devoid of desires and is totally selfless in all
his activities and has no Ego, is it impossible for a householder to attain
this state?
