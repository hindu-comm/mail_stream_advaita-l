It was not my intention, nor I have ever stated that Shri Shankara was
dishonest. If someone reads my sentence that way, I am extremely sorry. I
personally think that my sentence cannot be read that way. I would be more
                      -----------
than happy to withdraw that sentence if it pleases Shri Ramakrishnan. I am
clear in my mind however, that I never intended any disrespect to Shri
Shankara. That was the farthest thing in my mind.
