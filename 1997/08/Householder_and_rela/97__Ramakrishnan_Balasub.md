No one claimed so, except perhaps Jaldhar. Even shrI sha.nkara has said
that it's not impossible (it's only more difficult).

Rather simple. na karmaNAna prajayA dhanena tyagenaike
amR^itattvamAnashhuH, says the mahAnArAyaNa upanishhat. Being a
householder entails karma and making wealth to support the family. A son
is necessary to do tarpaNam. Since these are unnecessary for GYAna,
which leads to moxa, shrI sha.nkara points out only an ignorant person
will get into a householder's life. He points out it's as foolish as
being on one side of the bank of a river and taking a boat to reach the
same side of the bank :-). Makes sound sense.

If you are _really_ interested I can quote verses from the nArada
parivrAjaka upanishhhat, which shrI vidyAraNya has used (Giri mentioned
this). I don't have this upanishhat memorized and will have to get my
book from home. There are also very many other upanishhat-s which talk
about this rather explicitly. However, I fear this is going to be
another case of the "fate vs free-will". However many scriptural
references are given people are not willing to change their mind.

Ramakrishnan.
