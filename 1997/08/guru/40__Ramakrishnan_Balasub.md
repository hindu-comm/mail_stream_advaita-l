A sannyAsi also has to follow dharma, albeit a different one from that
of householders. Eg, one of the mukhya dharma-s of a sannyAsi is
ahi.nsA, whereas a householder is not obliged to follow ahi.nsA always.
Eg, if there is a threat of physical harm to his family or himself, he
can defend himself, however for a sannyAsi it's not the case. Other
strict vows are brahmacharya etc which are also part of the sannyAsi-s
dharma.

The only ones above dharma and adharma are the GYAni-s. However they
will never give this as an excuse to indulge, as their followers would
get the wrong idea.

Ramakrishnan.
