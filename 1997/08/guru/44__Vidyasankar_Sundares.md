The Vaishnava Goswamis seem to be quite independent of the dasanamis.
There are some Gosains who bear dasanami titles, but are householders. In
this connection, read J. N. Bhattacharya's "Hindu Castes and Sects". It
was reprinted in 1969 from Calcutta, and contains some information on the
dasanamis and the gosains. As for representation of all 10 names, araNya,
ASrama, vana, parvata and sAgara are very rare nowadays, but there are a
number of ascetics surnamed giri. However, tIrtha and sarasvatI have come
to be used by non-advaita traditions too, especially dvaita and gaudiya
Vaishnavism. Also, bhAratI has come to be used as a general title given to
learned men, especially in south India. Two famous Tamil poets,
Gopalakrishna Bharati (18th cent.) and Subrahmanya Bharati (19th-20th
cents.) were not dasanamis, although the first lead a very ascetic kind of
life.

Ghurye's book is quite good, but it is more general than the other two. It
covers the monks belonging to various Hindu and non-Hindu traditions,
while the other two concentrate on the dasanamis. Sadananda Giri's book is
quite comprehensive, although he writes from a north Indian perspective,
and doesn't seem to understand the southern maThas very much.
