That makes a lot of sense given what we know about the history of the
times.

Here things get a little murkier.  One Naga bawa that my family knew was
called Nilakantha Giri.  Maybe it started with Puri, Bharati, and
Saraswati then spread to the other names?  Anyway I thought that all
10 names were represented.  And there is a caste called gosais (From
Sanskrit Goswami) who are functionaries in Shaiva mandirs and have
surnames like Saraswati, Giri etc. but they are householders not sannyasis
of any kind.  They are also different from the Vaishnava leaders called
Goswamis who are also householders.  May be somewhere along the line they
got mixed up with the Nagas?

There was an A.S. Ghurye who wrote a book about the history of Sannyasa
too but I've only glanced at it so I can't tell you if its any good. I'll
take another look and also at the others you mention.
