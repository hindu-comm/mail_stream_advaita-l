Yes a sannyasi should be disciplined but dharma consists of actions which
a sannyasi cannot be bound by.  So some other word should be chosen to
describe a sannyasis ethic, niyama perhaps?

A small digression but somewhat relevant to the discussion at hand.  What
about the sannyasis we call in Gujarati "Naga bawas"[1]?  As
the name suggests they are usually naked or lightly dressed and usually
live in jungles away from people.  But on occasions like kumbha melas[2]
they parade in regiments carrying trishuls and other weaponry.  There are
many historical accounts of how they used to fight the Muslims or
Vaishnava sannyasis. They are dashanamis and they consider the
Shankaracharyas as their leaders but obviously they are going by something
other than the dictionary definition of ahimsa.

[2] and shivratri in Ahmedabad and other major Gujarati cities.
