Excellent point Jaldhar, Where does shrI sureshvara say this?

I agree. We have more in common than I thought, especially Seinfeld and
Simpsons :-).

Also, thanks for the other reply to me. It makes things more clear.

I forgot to mention. The vAmamArga people do not believe in unrestrained
indulgence, but rather in very selective indulgence under a very
qualified guru and is not at all similar to what Osho says. In fact such
an approach is severely criticized. But this approach is also not
acceptable to advaitins in general.

BTW, I won't be replying to posts for some time. I am currently
finishing up my thesis. I am almost done, but a wee bit more work and
slides need to be done. So to all the Osho aficionados, good bye for
_some_ time. I'll be back, as Arnie would say. Oh, and also happy
indulging :-).

Ramakrishnan.
