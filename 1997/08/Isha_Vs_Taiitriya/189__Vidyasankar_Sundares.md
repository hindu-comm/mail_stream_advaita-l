There is no real contradiction. The ISa upanishad is quite difficult to
interpret, and does not say what you say above in an absolute sense.
According to Vedanta, nobody is doomed to an eternal darkness. Rather, it
is the other way round. If you desire immortality/liberation, having
progeny is not the way to it. If you desire progeny, it is best to do so
in accordance with social responsibilities. That is the purport.
