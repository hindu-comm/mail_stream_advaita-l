The sacred month of ShraavaNa is upon us. This month is held to be sacred
for the worship of Shiva, especially on Mondays. The bilva-ashhTottara
(attributed to Shankaraachaarya) has it that worship of Shiva during the
evening twilight hours on Mondays during the month of ShraavaNa is more
important than even the worship on the Shivaraatri.

The birthday of Krishna also falls in this month, on the eight day of the
dark fortnight. Goddess Mahalakshmi is also worshipped on Fridays of this
month, especially in Southern India.

I thought it would be wonderful to embark on a mental pilgrimage to the
12 jyotirlinga's of Shiva, the most sacred of His emblems. These 12
linga's are as follows: 1) Somanaatha in Saurashtra, 2) Mallikaarjuna at
Srisaila, 3) Mahaakaala at Ujjain, 4) Omkaareshvara and amaleshvara, 5)
Vaidyanaatha at Paralii, 6) Bhiimashankara at Daakinii, 7) Raamesha at
Setubandha, 8) naagesha at daarukaavana, 9) Vishvesha (Vishvanaatha) at
VaaraaNasii, 10) tryambaka on the banks of the river Godavari ,
11) Kedaara on the Himalayas, and 12) Ghushmesha at Shivaalaya. The mere
utterance of these 12 names of the jyotirlinga's is believed to destroy
great sins and confer merit.

There is hymn called the dvaadasha-jyotirlinga-stotra that describes
these 12 linga's. This hymn is attributed by some to Shankaraachaarya.

Let us then begin the mental pilgrimage (maanasa yaatraa) with
Somanaatha. The verse describing Somanaatha is this:

sauraashhTradeshe vishade .atiramye
 jyotirmayaM chandrakalaavatamsaM  |
bhaktipradaanaaya kR^ipaavatiirNaM
 taM somanaathaM sharaNaM prapadye || 1 ||


sauraashhTradeshe - in the Saurashtra  state
vishade - pure
atiramye -  extremely beautiful
jyotirmayaM - full of brilliance
 chandrakalaavatamsaM - (who has) the moon as an ornament on His head
bhaktipradaanaaya -  for bestowing Bhakti
 kR^ipaavatiirNaM - (who has) descended out of His compassion
taM - that
somanaathaM - Lord Somanaatha
 sharaNaM prapadye - I seek refuge in

 I seek refuge in Lord Somanaatha who wears the moon as an ornament on
 His head, who is the full of brilliance (in the form of the jyotirlinga),
 and who for bestowing bhakti (devotion) has descended, out of His
 compassion, in the pure and extremely beautiful Sauraashtra country.

 About Somnath: The famous temple of Somnath is located on the coast
 of Gujarat, west of Diu. There are many legends associated with the
 temple and the surrounding area, including the one which says that
 Krishna, while resting, was mistaken for a deer by a hunter.
 Bus service is available from Junagadh and Veraval. There is a guest
 house near the temple.
