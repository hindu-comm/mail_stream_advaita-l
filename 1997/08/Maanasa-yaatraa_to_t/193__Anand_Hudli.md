 I praise Shiva known as Lord Omkaareshvara, the One without a second,
 who , in order to make saintly people cross the ocean of saMsaara,
 always resides in the town of Maandhaataa at the sacred confluence of
 the rivers Kaaverii and narmadaa.

 About Omkareshwar: This extraordinary jyotirlinga is found at an
 extraordinary site in current Madhya Pradesh. At the confluence of the
 rivers Kaveri and Narmada, is an island shaped like an AUM, the holiest
 of all holy symbols. This island is home to the beautiful temple
 of the Jyotirlinga of Shiva known as Shri Omkar Mandhata.

 Reaching there: About 77 kms. from Indore by bus is the place called
 Mortakka, also called Omkareshwar junction. Private buses take pilgrims
 from Mortakka to Omkareshwar, the distance being 13 kms. Accommodation
 is available at the Holkar Guest House or a number of "Dharmashalas",
 places constructed for charity.

 According to one account, another linga called amaleshvara is also found
 here.
