 For the purpose of being protected from premature death, I bow to Lord
 Mahaakala, the Great God (Mahaadeva) who has taken up the avataar in
 Ujjain in order to grant liberation to all saintly persons.


 About Ujjain: Ujjain has long been famous as a holy city. Situated on
 the banks of the Shipra  (corrupt form for Kshhipraa) river, it abounds
 in temples and other sites of great religious and historical
 significance.  Shiva resides here as Mahakaala, Time. The temple of
 Mahaakaleshvar is a source of awe and inspiration to the people of the
 city and pilgrims. Other temples of significance are the Bade Ganeshji
 Mandir which boasts of a large and artistic statue of Ganesha and also
 Panchamukhi (five-faced) Hanumaan, the Gadkalika temple of Kaalikaa,
 where Kalidasa, arguably the greatest poet and playwright in all of
 Sanskrit literature, received his literary skill as a boon from
 Goddess Kaalikaa, the Harsiddhi temple with idols of Mahasarasvati,
 Mahalakshmi and Annapurna, and also the Shri Yantra (Chakra), the
 temple of Kalabhairava, and the Mangalnath temple which is believed
 to the place where the planet Mangal (Mars) was born, the Gopal Mandir,
 the Navagraha Mandir, and the Chintamani Ganesh Mandir across the
 Shipra.

 The Pir Matsyendranath, on the banks of the Shipra,  is a spot of great
 significance to followers of the Nath sect of Shaivism.

 Kalidasa is said to be from Ujjain. In the Meghaduuta poem, he describes
 his beloved city Ujjain in his usual literary style.

 Ujjain used to be a center of astronomical studies in ancient India. It
 still has an observatory. Important works of astronomy such as the
 Suurya Siddhaanta are believed to have been written here. According to
 Indian astronomers, the latitude Tropic of Cancer passes through Ujjain.
 Also, Ujjain was taken to be the reference for longitudes. Thus Ujjain
 may be called the Greenwich of ancient India.

 In recent times, the Madhya Pradesh Government has set up the Kalidasa
 Academy to commemorate the great poet-playwright. This is a multi-
 disciplinary institution has as one of its objectives, research and
 study in Sanskrit literature, and classical and traditional performing
 arts.

 Modern Ujjain, in the state of Madhya Pradesh, is 55 kms. from Indore
 which is connected by flights with Delhi, Bhopal, Gwalior, and Mumbai
 (Bombay).
 Bus service is available from Indore. There is also an
 Ujjain railway station in the Bhopal-Nagada sector of the Western
 Railway.
