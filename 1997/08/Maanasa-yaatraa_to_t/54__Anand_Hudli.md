tulaadrituJNge   .api  -  even more lofty than similar mountains
mudaa - with pleasure
vasantaM - residing
tamarjunaM mallikapuurvamekaM - the One Mallikaarjuna
namaami - I bow to
saMsaarasamudrasetum - the bridge over the ocean called samsaara

I bow to Lord Mallikaarjuna, who is the bridge over the ocean called
samsaara, who resides with pleasure on the peak of the Shriishaila mountain
which is the meeting place of the gods, and which is loftier than mountains
of similar reputation.

The linga at Shrishaila bears the name Mallikaarjuna, and the devii is known
as Bhramaraambikaa. The word "arjuna" is also the name of a kind of tree. The
word "mallika" is the name of jasmine creepers. Thus the name "Mallikaarjuna"
also means the arjuna tree entwined by jasmine creepers. The word
"Bhramaraambika" also means a female bee.

Shankara, in his Shivaanandalaharii, has made use these double meanings of the
words in composing verses dedicated to Mallikaarjuna and Bhramaraambikaa of
Shriishaila.

The Bhamaramba Mallikarjunaswamy temple is one of the most ancient and sacred

the Kailaasa (abode of Shiva) of the South.

According to the Andhra Pradesh tourism department, tours are available

are well connected by air, rail, and road from other major cities in
