Rajneesh was a conman nothing more really needs to be said.  He wasn't the
first Indian to discover that a good way of disguising bullshit is to call
it "Eastern philosophy" and he probably won't be the last.  If there are
any people who should really be the target of invective and derision it is
the ones who despite all the evidence in front of their faces insist on
taking him seriously.

What truths are these?  On what grounds do you believe he communicated the
truths of any tradition?  To make this assessment you must have thought
about it somewhat.

Well here's something interesting I read in todays New York Times.
There's an article in the Science section about how doctors tracked down a
salmonella outbreak in the Oregon town near which his commune was located.
Apparently in order to corruptly influence elections in the town, two
Rajneesh cultists delibrately contaminated salad bars with the deadly
bacteria.  _751_ cases were reported.  And you think people should be
getting spiritual advice from such a person?  If you have a defense of
mass poisoning by all means post it.  I'm sure a lot of people would be
interested.

So let me know how you judge the merits of attempted murder.  It should be
quite simple.  if it isn't you have bigger problems than being tyrannised
by your mind.
