Can any of the members point me towards any sources in the sruti on this
topic (for my next 'essay' in a couple of weeks time!). I understand the
bR^ihadaaraNyaka (pardon my transliteration!) is pertinent - anyone have a
reference? Any help gratefully received (Osho doesn't seem to have a great
deal on the topic - more on desire!!

Dennis
