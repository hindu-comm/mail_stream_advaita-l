Would somebody explain the Chariot anology clearly please? Every book
I read carries a different explanation to it! The most  reasonable one I
read was the one by Rajagopalachari who equates the horses to the
senses, the chariot to the body, the reins to the MIND, the charioteer to
our faculty of UNDERSTANDING and the rider to the Self.
