Utter naivete error number one:

When I went to Badrinath and Kedarnath, I happened to see some so-called
sAdhu-s taking pot. After that they had more equanimity than anyone I
have seen. If a guy has the adulation of thousands of idiots, drugs and
women at his disposal, 90 odd Rolls Royces given by some prize fools,
etc, etc, there is no reason why he shouldn't possess "equanimity". In
fact I would expect him to have _LOTS_ of it.

So I gather you believe everything you see in videos. So did you believe
that Arnie actually shot people in Terminator 2? If you haven't seen it
please see it and tell me. You probably will believe it, it's very
realistic. The rest of don't (most of us, I don't know about the zealots
of "open mind"). But don't worry, you are in good company. My six year
old cousin sincerely believes Arnie got rid of the evil robot who can
metamorphose into whatever form he wishes.

Utter naivete error number 2:

Not everything can be bought like Lobsters.

Stuff and nonsense, I say. I have never been to a proper Ashram where it
is "filled" with people like this. I don't care for your experiences
with so-called indulgers in any case. If you think you can give your
so-called experience as proof you are sadly mistaken. It counts for
nothing.

Utter naivete number 3:

Example 1. There are people (I have met a few) who think that the
ultimate beauty is Linda Evangelista and she is the one they want to be
with. Unfortunately they can't even get to meet her. What are they
supposed to do?

Example 2: What about people who are obssessed with Marilyn Monroe? Oh,
I get it. You guys are the guys who "create" their reality right?
Thanks, that explains it all!!

Since there was no error in the first place, this objection does not
stand.

Sorry. The mass murderer _says_ he had the urge to kill, he repressed it
for a lot of time and it blew up! Even about a year back there was a
case in Texas like this. So my point still remains. I know very well
that p=>q does not mean q=>p. So according to Osho the remedy for
repressing murderous thoughts is to go and murder. My point still
remains. Don't think you can throw me off track by using p, q etc.

>I believe you think you have.  But your language betrays you.

Don't give this cute stuff. If you can argue properly please do. If you
could you wouldn't be making pot-shots trying to throw me off track.

>Whatever joy I feel is tempered by how little of him you have understood.

?!! Again, please argue properly if you can. Merely asserting I haven't
understood something doesn't mean anything.

Ramakrishnan.
