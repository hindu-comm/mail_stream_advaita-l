You wrote: "the truth is one". That is why there cannot be any
contradiction in it. I mean when we have two sentences which
contradict each other then one of them is true and the other one must
be false. To try to find out which is which means to seek for the
Truth. Elementary, isn't it? Were it not so, people would never swap
opinions, which we are trying to do now.
