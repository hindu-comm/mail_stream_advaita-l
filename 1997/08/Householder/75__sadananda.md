I think Vidya has answered to the point regarding the sanyaasa.  We had
these discussions in the past and Jaldhar H. Vyas insists on the external
sanyaasa as well. Apparently he strongly believes in it. So be it.  Since
he believes in it,  he can not get liberation without taking sanyaasa.  If
you think you can gain liberation without taking external sanyasa you can.
This is called self-fulfilling prophesy.

But from the truth point, all these external things are helpful but not
essential.  They are neither necessary nor sufficient for realization.  But
external environment can help to setup a conducive environment for
contemplation. Just like going to sleep.  Good soft bed and conducive
environment are helpful but they do not guarantee sleep.  In India when we
were students there used to be a third class compartments with people
packed to the core.  We were getting comfortable sound sleep(sound for
others) on somebody's shoulders!

What counts are the four qualifications that Vidya elucidated that help in
the purification of the mind.  Ultimately as Shankara says in
VivekachuuDaamani:

na yogena sa sankhyena karmaNaa nona vidyayaa|
brahmaatmaika bodhena mokshasidhyati naanyatha||

Neither by yoga, nor by shankhya nor my action nor by studies one can gain
liberation.  Only by the teachings (understanding) of the oneness of
Brahman and atma that one can gain liberation and by none other.

Hari Om!
