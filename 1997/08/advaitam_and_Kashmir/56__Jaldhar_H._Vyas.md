The problem with Subjective Idealism is that if everyone is creating their
own realities how do you explain why everyones reality differs only in
trivial details.  For example why does the Sun rise for me at exactly the
same time as everyone else in my town?  This theory relies too much on an
improbable amount of coincidence.

I don't see this as being too incompatible with Advaita. We also recognize
that Ishvara or Saguna Brahman performs the creation, maintenance, and
dissolution of the worlds.
