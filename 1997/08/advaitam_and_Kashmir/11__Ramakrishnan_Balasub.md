The above information is somewhat incorrect. There are shaiva Agama
texts which uphold advaita in it's highest form, eg, the devikAlottara.
It's one of the Agama-s, although it's considered a "minor" one by the
shaiva-s. There are other advaitic Agama-s also.

Further the tantra texts teach advaita, but not advaita as in the sense
of  shrI sha.nkara. These texts uphold the reality of the world and do
not accept the brahma satya jagat mithyA idea. In fact these texts
criticize outright, advaita vedAnta as taught by shrI sha.nkara. It's
somewhat similar to Kashmir shaivism in fact!

Ramakrishnan.
