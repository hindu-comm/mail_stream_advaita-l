Hi Jaldhar!

Everyone sees the 'Sunrise' but the 'Sun' and it's 'rise' is given many
different values and interpretations according to the person. eg. Sungod,
star, continued drought, "stopping me sleep in", too early, too late
(especially in the poles!), etc.

And the baby doesn't conceptualise the Sunrise. It just sees light and feels
warmth and glory.

Regards,

Martin.
