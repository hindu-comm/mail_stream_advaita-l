Correlate?  Not I.  Mainly just quoting Ramana.

Agree.

Yes, Ramana answered many questions in such a way, like "Obtain
GYAna, then ask."

Excuse me, I have asked no questions in this RM interchange, other than
bibliographical or linguistic questions.  Of course I have read Talks
(several of the quotes I gave a few days ago were from that volume),
which is the main reason I have not asked the same questions that
are asked there.

Yes I know that ajnanis cannot really discuss what jnanis see.  And jnana
won't be the outcome of any of this discussion, either!
