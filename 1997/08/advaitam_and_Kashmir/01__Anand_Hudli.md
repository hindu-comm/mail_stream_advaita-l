 The sarvaM khalvidaM brahma statement of the Chhaandogya upanishhad is
 interpreted differently by Shankara. What he says is that the world
 originates, exists, and merges or dissolves in Brahman. It is in this
 sense that he says "All this verily is Brahman." He does not mean,
 at least in this context, that the world of names and forms exists in
 Brahman as a reflection or that Brahman is identified with names and
 forms.
