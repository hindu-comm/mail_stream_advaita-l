Then the meaning of the statement you quoted should be obvious by now!
It is not that the world appears as real once more, it is only that what
others see as the world is perceived as brahman alone, which is the
substratum (of the illusion of the world as we see it) by the GYAni. The
world as we see it _is_ by mAyA only. There is no "degree" of
studentship involved here.

Ramakrishnan.
