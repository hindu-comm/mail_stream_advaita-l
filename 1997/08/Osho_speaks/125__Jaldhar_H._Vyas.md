Venkat, I'm sorry there has been some miscommunication here.  My intention
was not to "beat up" on you but rather to appeal to your own higher
nature.  You know full well putting salmonella in peoples salad is no kind
of sadhana whatsoever.  So why the hesitation?   Rajneesh did a lot of
reprehensible things but for some them you do have to stop and think
before condemning  them.  I acknowledge that.  The reason I brought up
this example is because it _doesn't_ require any moral high horse.  It
doesn't even require a moral shetland pony to know it's wrong.  That's why
I'm apalled by the hemming and hawing expressed by some members of this
list.

Experiences are all well and good but they must be evaluated in the light
of reason.  You have heard of the analogy of the charioteer right?  The
senses are like the horses, they make the chariot go forward but it is the
mind as charioteer who makes sure they go in the right direction.

And as for being new at this you aren't!  Puntambekar is a well known name
in Pandityam.  There was a Mahadeva Punatambekar (Punyastambhavasin) who
was an author on Nyaya and a poet I think.  If that's your ancestry you're
well on your way!
