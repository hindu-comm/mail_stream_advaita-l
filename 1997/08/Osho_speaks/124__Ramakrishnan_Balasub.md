Please read my mail carefully, the point was that Osho provided the
"justification", for these. Maybe I should have made it more clear. In
any case see my reply to Dennis Waite where I have explained this point
in more detail. It should hopefully clear up the mist.

However, my criticism of the "indulge till you tire" philosophy (first
part of my mail) had no connection with this part of my mail and still
stands.

Ramakrishnan.

PS: In case you didn't know, sending a mail in all caps is considered
the internet equivalent of spitting on the road. It also makes it rather
difficult to read.
