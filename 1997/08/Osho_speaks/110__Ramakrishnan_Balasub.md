I wonder if you have seen any of the programs about Hitler. The videos
clearly show his presence (without any of the modern techniques used as
in the case of Osho). You have to see it to believe it. There are very
many frauds with "power" and "presence" and "language". These mean
_nothing_.

This is exactly the kind of thinking condemned by GYAni-s. The right way
is not criticize others for making mistakes and dwelling on it, but
rather follow the dharma as far as oneself is concerned. The path of
dharma is rather clearly laid out.

I never said he is a charlatan, however if he makes the claim that he is
representing advaita as has been handed down for ages, he is most
definitely a charlatan.

Ramakrishnan.
