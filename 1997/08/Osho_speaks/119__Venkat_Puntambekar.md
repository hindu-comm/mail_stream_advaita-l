I thought I would not respond to these mails. I am sure Jaladhar and Ramakrishnan would
jump on me and call me a wimp and label me "this guy cannot argue".
Actually thats fine with me, I am not at all perturbed. Btu I had to say this..

Now if understanding
Advaita was like knowing if something is mass poisning, then I am probably one
of those low IQ folks Ramakrishnan alluded to. If it were that simple, then we would
not be having this list nor these outbursts. As Martin pointed out "our heart
and intuition CAN help us know", but it takes practice whihc should lead
to experience. Scriptures can help you authenticate your experiences. Thats the role
of scriptures and they help you keep the excitement of the spritual journey.

ANyway, those who need to understand what I meant by "Who knows what is right and what is
wrong" would know what I meant. Jaladhar and Ramakrishnan, I have way too much respect
for you guys. Obviously both of you are well read and can quote the scriptures on
the fly. Can we now hear some experiences. I am serious. Infact I have asked
Giri also the same. SO why dont we hear from the rest of the list members about their
experiences, how they translate the teachings into practice. ANd please lets get
off the moral high ground.

Please remmeber that there are a few of us on this list who are new to this journey.
