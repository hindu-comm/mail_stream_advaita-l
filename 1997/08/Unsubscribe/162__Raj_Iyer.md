Dear Ravi,

I shall be completing my employment contract with my present employer in a
week's time and shall be moving to California next month to begin employment
there.  I therefore request a temporary unsubscribing from the Advaita mailing
list.  I have greatly enjoyed and benefited from the vigourous debates posted,
although at times it appeared that we may have spent time splitting hairs.  I
hope to renew my subscription in the near future.  Thanks.

Raj Iyer.
