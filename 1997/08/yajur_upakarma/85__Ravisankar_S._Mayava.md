namaste

As many of you know, yajur upakarma falls on 18th of august and
followed by the gaayatri japam on 19th. I request knowledgeable list
members to write the significance and the importance of the yajur
upakarma.

Also one of my friends wrote to me that we should do the upakarma on
17th in the U.S. and not on 18th based on the nakshatram (star).
Can someone throw more light on this issue?

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Ravi
