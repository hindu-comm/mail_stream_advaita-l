        The argument is simple. You say that anyone who is not in the
sannyaasa ashrama (external sannyas) can not be a jnani. I have quoted
Shankara from BGB, Ramana Maharshi and Rama has recently even quoted the
HH of Sringeri saying that it is *possible* that a person not going
through the sannyasa ashrama may be a jnani (like Janaka). But it is
extremely rare and should not be used as an _excuse_ to continue in the
life of a householder.

        Basically, the argument is this : Do you think it is at all
possible that a householder/king etc. can be a jnani ? The answer is yes,
it is possible, not probable, according to Shankara. Of course, you can
differ from Shankara, but you can not claim that only your view is the
advaita vedantic tradition.

        And don't complain that I haven't read His works in sanskrit. You can
even find few of my translations of Shankara's works in
        ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/private/sanskrit/sanskrit.html
Of course, my knowledge of sanskrit is rudimentary, but I can understand
enough to judge whether the translation is satisfactory or not.
