To what degree can an ego control itself? Isn't it better to realise the
Self first? Seek first the kingdom of heaven; realise the self. Then there
is true love and power - the split is healed. I've tried the approach of
morality and dharma and I just _cannot_ do it! By that standard I'm
disqualified from realising who I am..!?
