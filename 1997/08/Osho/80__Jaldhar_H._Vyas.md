Because you can't.

If you don't know what kind of person someone is why treat them as some
kind of authority?  Also how come you don't know what kind of a person he
was?  If someone wrote 600 books and made videotapes and was all over the
media it should give some clues as to what kind of person they are.

Do you really think some sinister force is out there manipulating the CIA,
the state of Oregon, the justice system, paying 751 people to fake
salmonella poisoning, and planting stories in the New York Times and other
media all over the world?  I thought Americans had a monopoly on paranoid
conspiracies. It's nice to see the English are catching up :-)

It may.  Who was doing the referencing?  Other cultists or people within
the advaita tradition?  That tradition is right out in the open so it
should be easy to correlate it to any persons thinking.
