Hari Om !
Many thanks for your mail. A brief introduction about me is as follows:

My full name is Ramesh Iyer. I am originally from Madras. I have been
living in Sydney, Australia for the past 10 years (wife and a son). I am
quite new to the world of spirituality (just about 2 years).
I have been attending a Chinmaya Mission Bhagavad Gita Study group here
in Sydney along with my family for about 2 years and also attend yagnas
from time to time. My son attends the Bala vihar classes.I am extremely
keen in following the discussions in the advaita group to learn more and
contribute if I can.

Ramesh Iyer
