Namaste Anand!

I mentioned in  "Chandi Homa"  that there are several variations depending on
the local traditions.

We do Ratrisukta in the begining and Devisukta at the end.

Kali, Chandi, Kaumari, Indrani etc. are Vibhuti's (dont know english word for
vibhuti) of Sri Parvati who is a Vibhuti of Moola Shakti Sri Mahalakshmi,
Universal Mother.

Kalisukta and Devisukta are not the same.

You are right at the end we do aparadha-kshamarpana.

Shubham                                                  Nageswar
