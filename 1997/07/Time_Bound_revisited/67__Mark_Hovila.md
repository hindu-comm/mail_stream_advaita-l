Sure.  What I am saying is live with the question, the openness, the
inquiry. That is where the real life is.  It is when we want to immediately
take it to the conclusion, which is indeed the "way" of the vast majority
of us, that we are lost.

Yes, I know, we're not really lost, we just think we are.  It's a good
point to remember, but it can be a slippery slope.  Ego can and will use
this to stifle true inquiry.

Actually, there is no satisfying reply to this question. Either you come
to the conception of something like "original sin", or you must agree
that any conception of karma, wandering etc., from the absolute point of
view (paramaarthataH), do not denote anything real. Advaitins are in
favour of the latter idea. In this way they do not feel obliged to
account for anything that is a result of avidyaa. Another thing is that
even the conditioned world has some inner logic, so I personally do not
feel satisfied with the answer. I am looking forward to learning from
you a better explanation.

But what about the beginning of the chain of karma, which is the most
interesting question here?

        Your question is not a simple one. The daily lives of Advaitins follow
the Advaitic Tradition that is consistent to Hindu Scriptures and to the
philosophy established by Sankara. In pure Advaitic philosophy, there is
neither creation, action nor destiny and the question is also an
illusion. The day to day life related questions and answers to those
questions are beyond the scope of  pure Advaitic tautology.  It is
important to understand that Advaita as proposed by Sankara is package
deal! The most important part of Advaita is the establishment of a
linkage between the Hindu Scriptures, the Advaitic tautology and day to
day life.  Scriptures contain an ocean of knowledge and any
interpretation is subject to the perception of the scholars and their
scholarship.  This may explain the disagreements that existed between
religious scholars and philosophers.  Faith and intuition play an
important role in accepting a religion and/or a tradition.
        Human life consists of both material aspects as well as the spiritual
aspects.  On the material aspects of human life the question can be
answered as follows: The archer who shoots the arrow is always faced
with an uncertainty and there is no 100 percent guarantee that the arrow
will hit the aimed target. It is also true when an arrow leaves the bow
the archer has no control over the arrow! The archer is fully
responsible for the Karma and will be rewarded or punished accordingly.
The purpose of Karma theory is to develop discipline and responsibility
for future actions.  The materialistic economic theory comes very close
to the Karma theory on the material aspects of human life.
        The spiritual aspects of human life are very well stated in Karma Yoga
of Bhagavad Gita. Karma Yoga states that spiritual seekers should
conduct their actions without looking for the fruits of their actions.
The purpose of life for the spiritual seeker is to seek unity with the
Divine.  Divinity is anywhere and everywhere and every action is
spontaneous and transfers to inaction.  Such spontaneous actions can be
witnessed when we see the blooming flowers.  In spiritual life, the
actor do not evaluate actions, their causes and effects. The actor
consequently burnt the actions until they become inaction!
