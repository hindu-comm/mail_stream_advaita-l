Hi   Martin,

>Who is there to make a distinction? Beauty, love, intelligence, feelings.
>You know.... human stuff, heart stuff.

    Why not "SELF-stuff?"


>Who is being violent to whom? An owned aspect of consciousness is being
>violent to a disowned aspect of consciousness.

     But exactly WHO owns this aspect?   WHO disowns it?

     Can pure consciousness ever be divided from Itself?


>I am asking - What is the motivation for violence? Isn't it caused by the
>sense of separation?

     But what SEPARATE one is really there to sense this so-called "separation?"

>If so, then when that sense of separation is gone,

     .......from WHOM?......

>violence should be gone too.

     How can violence really "come" and "go?"  Isn't the Self always complete?

     But the violence may not really be the problem at all.

     The problem may only be in believing that there is a quintessential
difference between the "victor" and the "victim."  The Self is all that
there really is.

                                   With Blessings,


                                      Chuck Hillig
