     Needing an ego to have a discussion is about as important as needing
the actor to also be present when his image appears on the screen.

     And, I believe, Christ once cursed a fig tree.

     It's paradoxical but there can be feelings without a feeler.

     Perhaps the mahatmas didn't do anything to stop Hitler for the same
reason that Krishna didn't do anything to stop the battle that Arjuna was

     When you arm wrestle with yourself, the winner and loser are both the same.
