        When you say that law of destiny is the "primal cause of all", is
it the same as saying that destiny IS the causality that we see in
whatever reality our mind constructs?

I agree with you that we become aware of our thoughts after they occur.
In this context I would like to know what you think of awareness: is it
also another thought, or do you equate it to "consciousness".
It seems to me that most of our thoughts are reactive.  We either accept
things or reject them (our approach to life, by way of thought is
algorithmic). On the other hand there are insights that we have, which
have the quality, in some vague sense (which I really can't put into
words), to unify the object-subject duality. I think it is such insights
that lead to understanding.
I would like to discuss this classification of thought with the members of
this list.

Regards,
Prashant.
