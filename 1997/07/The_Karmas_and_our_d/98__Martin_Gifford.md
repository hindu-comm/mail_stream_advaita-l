Hi Vidyasankar!

What a fabulous response you gave! Thanks.

Re: the above. I would add that body/mind mechanisms affect each other and
also there are limitations on the physical plane. These automatically imply
and enforce at least some destiny!

For example we create a society and laws hoping that people don't get too
far away from the perspective of the whole or greater good.
