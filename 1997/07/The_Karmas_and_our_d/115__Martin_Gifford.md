...............The point I am making is - 'Where is the centre of the One
true Self? There can be none. Therefore We are the Self - The creators and
the instruments of creation and the will and the canvas of creation, etc.
Every act we make is an act of creation.

I would add that we are creators only when we are in the non-dual state.
Ignorant dualistically thinking people are the conditioned, the created.
Errors too I might add!

Regards,

Martin.
