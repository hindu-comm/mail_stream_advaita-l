I was also wondering exactly the same thing :-). Thanks for the
clarification. As I understood from the bhAshhya lalitA is only
karmaphalapradA and distributes the fruits _impartially_.

A totally unrelated topic. Western academia usually dismisses the lalitA
trishatI bhAshhya attributed to shrI sha.nkara and the shrI vidyAratnA
sUtra attributed to shrI gauDapAda assuming ad hoc that they would not
accept these kinds of upAsana. On reading the trishatI bhAshhya I found
that the quotes given follow shrI sha.nkara's usual pattern, i.e.,
mostly from the bR^ihadArNyaka, chhAndogya, taittirIya upanishhad-s and
also from the katha and other prinicipal upanishhad-s (the frequency of
quotations also seems to follow his usual pattern) and also the bhagavat
gItA. The mImA.nsA school is as usual attacked with great vigour. It
would be interesting to see if it satisfies some of the other Hacker's
criteria also.

Ramakrishnan.
