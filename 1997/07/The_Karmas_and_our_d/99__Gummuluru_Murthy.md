I congratulate Shri Vidyasankar on a well-stated beautiful article on the
topic.

My question is this: Why not let destiny control one's life ? I would not
use the word "control" but I would phrase my question this way.

Destiny is what is in store for any of us. Why not let it take its own
course ? It certainly would, irrespective of whether we "let" it or not.
By this I mean: "Recognize that what is going to happen is going to
happen. Be happy with the outcome. i.e. convert your happiness (in the
dvandva) to eternal happiness". Shri Vidyasankar says "You can change your
destiny through the use of your will". Why does one want to change
destiny ? Or, why does one want to *think* that one can change destiny ?
What I said above does not preach passivity or inaction, but says seek
happiness in whatever "action" you do and whatever the "result" of that
"action".
