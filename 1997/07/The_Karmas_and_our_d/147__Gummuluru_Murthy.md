1. I looked into the dictionaries (we do not have many in our Library)
for the sanskrit equivalent of destiny. Some are

destiny = devam, adr^shhTam

Another possibility is vidhi (from the root word vidhaata, the creator)
meaning judgement from God.

devechcha may not be correct, because deva, God does not have a desire.

2. I found out that adr^shhTam is *not* negation of dr^shhTam. Hence,
'one that is not seen' may not be a proper meaning of adr^shhTam.

'drashhTa' (not dr^shhTa) is that is seen.

Word 'adr^shhTam', a root word by itself, has as one of its meanings
'fate'.

Putting 1 and 2 together, it seems to me destiny and adr^shhTam probably
have the same meaning (taking into account they are from different
languages). In this background, Shri Shankara's interpretation of
Karmaphalapradaa is quite clear, and of course consistent with
sruti, smr^ti and brahma sutra.
