I have no idea what the "Vairagyasataka" is (perhaps "100 Stanzas on
Renunciation?) but anyway, it says, "That which is *not* to be, shall never
*be*; that which is to *be* shall never *not* be; -- why dost thou not
drain this draught which will eradicate the poison of anxiety from
thyself?"

The wording "that which is to *be* shall never *not* be" in particular
reminds me of Jonathan Bricklin's very interesting comment which I quote:

>I would not say all actions are predestined, I would say all actions exist
>all and only at once.
