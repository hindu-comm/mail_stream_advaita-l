As more evidence of the transcultural truth of advaitism (aka the reform
branch of Advaita Vedanta) I offer, in line with what you have just posted,
the following quote  from Boethius:

"...since God lives in the eternal present, His knowledge transcends all
movement of time and abides in the simplicity of its immediate present.  It
encompasses the infinite sweep of past and future, and regards all things
in its simple comprehension as if they were now taking place.  Thus, if you
will think about the foreknowledge by which God distinguishes all things,
you will rightly consider it to be not a foreknowledge of future events,
but knowledge of a never changing present."

Regards,

Jonathan
