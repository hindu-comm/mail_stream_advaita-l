The problem with this is as follows.

How does one know what is destiny, or what it has in store for us? Is
destiny an absolute thing that exists independent of "us"? If yes, then
the "us" becomes nothing more than a "jaDa-vastu"; if no, then it follows
that it is under our control.

I would like to mention that in a philosophical discussion, one has to be
careful not to use words loosely. In Sanskrit, the word "daivam" is used,
indicating a divine dimension to "fate". This is strongly correlated to
the notion of ISvara as the one who apportions karma-phala. Right here, we
have two components - an individual initiative in doing whatever karma,
and something outside an individual's control, namely ISvara.

If you say that one cannot change the natural order of things (svabhAva),
then fine. But the word "destiny" has too many other kinds of meanings
that don't always fit in with svabhAva.

This issue can also be clarified by asking ourselves the following. Is
moksha destined for some, and not for others? This question has to be
looked at both from a paramArtha standpoint and a vyavahAra standpoint.
Just one perspective will not do. And, your answer to this question will
strongly determine your view of "destiny" and "will".

Regards,
Vidyasankar
