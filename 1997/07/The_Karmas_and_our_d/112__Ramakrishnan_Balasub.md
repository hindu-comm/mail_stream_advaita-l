The jaw may drop, but the statement has no support in the advaita
philosophy. If it is admitted that something is "happening", then there
is a "creator". An illusion cannot exist without a substratum. Advaita
vary clearly says that the illusion of "happenings" has the Atman for
the substratum, ekAtmapratyayasAram as the mANDUkya upanishhad says. The
saying you quote is some kind of viGYAnavadi buddhism, not advaita.

Ramakrishnan.
