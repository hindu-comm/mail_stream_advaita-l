Sorry for the late reply I was on vacation (Sort of but that's another
story.)  Anyway, as far as I know of, the Katyayani Tantra has not been
published either in English or Sanskrit.  Shri Bhaskararaya has quoted
extensively from it and there are quotes in other Shrividya works so the
work is probably not a forgery but as far as I know, there aren't any full
copies available.
