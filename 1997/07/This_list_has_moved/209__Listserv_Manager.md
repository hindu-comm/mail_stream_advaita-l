As of today this list has moved.  Other than using a different
address, you should not notice any changes (except hopefully, a little
better performance).

The SERVER address (the place you send commands) is now:
    listserv at listserv.tamu.edu       (not listserv at tamvm1.tamu.edu)
             --------                              ------

The LIST addresses (the place you send your messages) remains:
    advaita-l at tamu.edu


One nice benifit is that the archives are now available for both
reading and searching via the WWW at:
    http://listserv.tamu.edu/archives/advaita-l.html


Please have your list owner (owner-advaita-l at listserv.tamu.edu) contact
me if you notice any problems.
