But at least it is consistent with Papaji's (and Baleksekar's for that
matter) belief in the non-reality of free will.  It would be nice if every
enlightened being was as saintly as Anandamaya Ma, but it wouldn't be what
is.
Andrew Cohen's mission to clean up the Gurus is not evidence of his
enlightenment.
