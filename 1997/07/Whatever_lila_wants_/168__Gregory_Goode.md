Yes it is consistent with their belief.  To be clearer about cop-out, it's
a cop-out when the person doesn't deeply believe in the unreality of free
will but maybe believes it superficially, and uses that line because it's
socially acceptable in some circles.  I don't want to imply that I know
very much about Papaji and Andrew Cohen; all I know is what Cohen has
said in a few books.
