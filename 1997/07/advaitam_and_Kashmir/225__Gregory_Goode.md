The Mandukya Upanishad, Sri Gaudapada's Karika IV.79 summarizes this last
argument quite well (about the non-disappearance of the world) upon
realization and vice versa:

     On account of attachment to the unreal objects,
     the mind runs after such objects.  But it comes
     back to its own pure state when it becomes unattached
     to objects realizing their unreality.

               --Swami Nikhilananda's translation
