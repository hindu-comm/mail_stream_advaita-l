This has Berkeley correctly on the nature of the world but incorrectly on
the source of the ideas.  Berkeley argued that the world is ideas in the
mind, nothing else.  For Berkeley, physical objects, external objects
simply do not exist, and there just is no noumenal world at all.  But he
argued that God is the source of all our ideas, not the mind itself.  The
mind is the locus or the perceiver of the ideas.
