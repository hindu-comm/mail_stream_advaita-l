I agree with Gaudapada (and you too Greg?) that causality *is*
inconceivable, but I do not agree that causality *cannot* exist simply
because human beings cannot create a complete and coherent conceptual model
of it.  In my opinion, reality *is* absolutely unthinkable in the final
analysis, but it is as it is never the less...
