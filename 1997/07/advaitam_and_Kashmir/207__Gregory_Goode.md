Yes, but the world hasn't disappeared, it's instead being seen as Brahman.
RM doesn't say that anything disappears, or that name and form are not
there.  If X is the world and Y as Brahman, seeing X as Y doesn't mean X
isn't seen.   If RM Himself simply hadn't seen name and form, how could the
body
have carried out its daily biological functions?  How could He have answered
to the address of Bhagavan?

Do you think the underlined portion above means "world looks like Brahman"?
