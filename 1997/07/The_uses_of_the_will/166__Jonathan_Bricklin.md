There is a wonderful passage in Zorba the Greek where Zorba advises his
companion to eat as many grapes as he can stuff in his mouth  so that he'll
get sick.  That is his lesson on how to learn restraint.  I'm not saying it
is the only way, I'm not even saying that is the best way.  I am only
saying that it _is_ a way, and while humor often reveals an insight, the
laughter that Sri Ramana's response evoked may have served to drown out an
equally valid one.
