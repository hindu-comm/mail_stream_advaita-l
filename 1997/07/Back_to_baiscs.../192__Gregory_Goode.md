Namaste,

All the explanations are pointers.  Many teachers say not to mistake the
pointing finger for the moon it points to, and that what IT really is
cannot be explained.  It helps me to think of IT as that which sees
everything else.  Anything that can be seen or described cannot be It,
because these things would have to be seen or described by something.  That
which sees these things is exactly what It is.

To tell you the truth, for me the Ramana method of finding out who the
personal "I" is has not been helpful.  I coulnd't even get started tracing
it.  What has worked better for me has been explanations from
Shankaracharya, Nisargadatta, Ramesh Balsekar, and even Wayne Dyer and
Jeffrey Hopkins (Tibetan Buddhist author of YOGA OF EMPTINESS) about what
the personal "I" really is.  An idea, illusory appearance.
