        All causes lie in space-time.  But our Self is not part of this
space-time. It exists in a different "world", the world of endless
possibilities but no events. Therefore I donot believe that this enquiry
will lead to knowing the Self.  You will always find answers in the way
science provides them, but Self is something that cannot be found.  This
type of enquiry may "end" with knowing the Self.  Many list members have
recently talked about what "knowing the Self" is (recently Shri Allan
Curry, and Shri Gummuluru Murthy).
The Self is referred to in such esoteric terms because it is "nothing"
that can be known.  Hence any/all terms can be used.

        Speaking for myself, yes I do get such and other questions.
