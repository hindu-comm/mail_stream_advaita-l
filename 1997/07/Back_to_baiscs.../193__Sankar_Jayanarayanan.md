According to advaita, the true Self is the "Knower" which is Brahman. And the
next question, naturally, is what Brahman is.

Shankara explains in his brahma sUtra Bhaashhya that Brahman is never
introduced to the student as an object, since It is not "referable" to
as such. The only way to know Brahman is when all differences or divisions
of the world into categories is removed and Brahman is what is "left over" and
is known to be the Self of the idividual, for the Self can never be denied.

The Self is not to be thought of as a doer. Krishna makes this very clear
in the Gita.

In the very beginning of his commentary on the brahma sUtra, Shankara says
that it is natural in the human tendency to conceive that to be the Self
which is not the Self by making statements like,"I am this" or "This is mine."

[For example, when you say something like "I am this which is typing this email"
or "My fingers"]

When such erroneous ideas about the Self are removed, the Self shines of
its own accord.
