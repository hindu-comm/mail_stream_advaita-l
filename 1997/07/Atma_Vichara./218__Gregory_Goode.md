The analogy with light is a good one, and helps me to understand in the case
of Shiva.

But I'm not sure how well it will carry over to the case of Brahman
since Brahman isn't usually held to be the creator in the same way as Shiva.
The appearances we see, maya, etc. are not created, since they are not
really existents.  There are no objects that were ever created.  All
phenomenality is illusion.

Either way is a fruitful way of inquiry.  I think atma Vichara fits your
second choice, starting with observed manifestation, since you trace the
source of the manifestation, and trace to whom it occurs.
