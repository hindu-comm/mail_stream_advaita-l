A few days ago, Allan Curry brought up the notion that Siva seemed the
most appropriate God for the destruction of the ego.

Now, Sankara is widely regarded as an incarntion of Siva. Western scholars
think that this notion is mainly from the Sankaravijayam texts, the
earliest of which were written several centuries after Sankara's times.

Recently, however, Ramakrishnan informed me in a private conversation,
that Padmapada himself compares Sankara to Siva. I would like to collect
exact quotations from works of Sankara's direct disciples, mainly
Suresvara and Padmapada, drawing an equation or comparison between Siva
and Sankara. I would appreciate any help from those who have easy
access to editions of Padmapada's Pancapadika or the Varttikas or
Naishkarmyasiddhi of Suresvara.

Thanks,
Vidyasankar
