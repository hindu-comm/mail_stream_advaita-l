The "you" who sees is indeed nonexistent if it takes itself to be somebody,
a see-er.  Better to just be the seeing.  Or more simply put, just BE.

Imperfection is the failure to realize that perfection is staring us in the
face.

Great question, as long as we remain in the "who."  As soon as we demand
the answer, we are lost again.

Have a nice trip.
