Hi Mark,

     But if, as you say, there "is no duality, no self/other split," then
how is so-called "violence" (or, for that matter, even "non-violence") even
recognizable as such?   "Who" is really there to be making  that distinction?

     In other words, "who" is being "violent" towards "whom?"

     When your ego seemingly disappears (it doesn't really exist in the
first place),  there will be no separate one left to give "us" an answer,
anyway.  What a paradox!

                                With Blessings,

                                        Chuck Hillig
