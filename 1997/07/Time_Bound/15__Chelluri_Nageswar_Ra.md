Namste Chuck!

We are just infants have not reached the stage you did.   How could you say
Ego does not exist in the first place.  You are right in a larger sense but
if ego does not exist we would not be having this discussion at all.

Do you know Maharishi Valmiki who wrote Ramayan and how it all began.  One
day Valmiki goes to river for a bath.  There he saw two birds mating.  One
bird was suddenly hit by arrow.  The Maharishi could not stand the violence
and he gives a curse to the man who shot the arrow.   It is just a bird that
made maharishi angry.
Think of humans suppose to be highly evolved, killing each other.  Sometimes
this question pops up in my mind.   There were several mahatmas at the time
of world war II.   When maharishi valmiki  moved by the death of a bird how
come these mahatmas in forties did not do anything when Hitler exterminating
jews, hindus and moslems kill each in kashmir and christiansa kill each other
in Ireland.
hey have the power to stop it.

Could you answer this for me when you come back.

Regards
