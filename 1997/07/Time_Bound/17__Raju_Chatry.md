Martin,
How dare you to say you don't care what krishna supposedly said or did. Truth
would be perhaps that you don,t know who krishna is than how would you care
what he said or did ? Although you are trying to say what krishna said but
very partially. I think. For give me for daring to respond you, with very
little I know.
Raju
