     But Mark, if the "me" as an individual entity is non-existent, then
the "you" who is seeing this "non-existent me" ALSO has to be non-existent, too.

     The world and that "me" to which you refer are the same.  There is only
the Self.

     I  wonder, though, just how can the "me" ever be truly "absent" when
that "me" was never really there at all in the first place?    If we
acknowledge perfection, aren't we also equally implying the existence of its
opposite......imperfection?

     Maybe we can only really speak of an "is-ness" which transcends all
duality.  (But, then again, "who's" really "there" to do the speaking?)

P.S.  Thanks for the good dialogue, Mark.  I'll be off-line until the 8th.
