In the deep-sleep state, all of us [Realized, also non-Realized]
experience the same: nothing. The turiya state, which is a witness
to all the states, is there in the deep-sleep state.

May be Allan's question (to whom he calls a Realized person) should be:
How does the Realized person's waking state differ from our waking state ?
It is the waking state when we indulge in all our activities. If the
Realized person's waking state differs from the waking state of ours, then
we may say that X is a Realized person. For that, we do not need to take
the word of the person. That person's actions, and re-actions to normal
incidents in life are ample evidence whether X is realized or not.

Further, there is no need for a worldly statement that X is a guru and
Y is a disciple. That relation between a guru and a sishhya comes out
naturally and the mutual trust which Shri Vidyasankar mentioned will
evolve also naturally.

Obviously, in the modern age, we do not have the outward guru-sishhya
relations which prevailed in Shri Shankara's time, but still gurus and
sishhyaas are there and communicate by different methods.
