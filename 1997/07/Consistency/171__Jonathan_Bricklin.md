Well that's why I said "at least".  None of the above people you mentioned
believed in the non-reality of free will as far as I am aware.  Consistency
in the context I have given is neutral with respect to the behavior being
judged.  As is both the reality and the non-reality of free will.  All
belief in the non-reality of free does is remove vegeance as a response to
bad behavior.  The criminal code can stay pretty much intact.

At this very moment I almost feel that I have.

Well, like I said, I never claimed it was.

I can't imagine this.  I don't even understand it.  You are not up to your
usual standard in making a point here.  Please try again.

Happening is an illusion, yes?  That there is a self or agent making things
happen is a bigger illusion than that everything is happening
spontaneously.   But this brings us back to square one.
