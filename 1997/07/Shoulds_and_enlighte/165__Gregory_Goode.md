Agreed.  "Who" does the disregarding, "who" does the attaining?  If the
personal "I" doesn't exist, then if disregarding or attaining ever happen,
they happen without a personal doer.

A prescriptive "should" is also something that relies on the existence of a
personal I.  Who is it that "should" do or not do an action?  And who says?
Who accepts the results?  "Good" and "bad" for whom?  If there really is no
personal "I", then aren't these (disregard, should, attain, good, bad).

Perhaps it can be said that these terms are useful for those who now believe
in a personal "I".

Interesting (to me) question.  Does anything at all lead anyone to
enlightenment?
The scriptures and shastras are full of instances where the answer is Yes.
Or is enlightenment purely spontaneous, happening just when it happens?  An
appealing viewpoint is that all ideas, emotions, actions, perceptions and
conceptions are spontaneous appearances in consciousness.  A cinema show, with
no more inherent causal relation at work than between events the cinematic
bank robbery and the cinematic car chase.  According to this view (clearly
propounded by Nisargadatta and Balsekar), actions such as Vipassana occur and
perhaps enlightenment follows.  Or perhaps in the case of Susanne Segal
(COLLISION WITH THE INFINITE), sadhana-like actions do not occur, and
enlightenment follows.  With the cinema-view of manifestation, there are
no counterfactuals, no possible worlds.  Things just happen as they happen,
and
it's all appearances in consciousness.

With no personal "I" as the doer or focal point, effort is another appearance
in consciousness, no special meaning or causal efficacy.  Effort appears, and
certain things appear later...

Andrew Cohen accused Papaji (and others) of behaving badly, and confronted
them.  They are reported by Cohen (in his books) to say that these instances
of behavior aren't willed, they are merely "vasanas burning themselves out."
I agree with I think the spirit of what (I think) Ramakrishnan wrote, that
this kind of talk ("burning themselves out") sounds like an excuse, a cop out
by someone who knows better!
