     Perhaps it means that we should just fully throw ourselves into our
roles and to  read our lines (no matter what they might be) with gusto, wild
abandonment and total consciousness.

     The Self loves Itself as much as a Villain (or as a coward) as it does
as a Hero.

     Yes!   Exactly!  It really doesn't matter the role.  What's important
in both case is only their degree of attachment to (or, perhaps, their
interpretation OF) the results of  their actions.

      I agree.  Psychologically speaking, if we are ever to "become" what we
could be, we have to first be willing to be what we already are.    In
short, having the courage to openly say how we truly are, magically changes
"how we truly are."

     What keeps us stuck is our unwillingess to fully acknowledge "what's
so" for us. Or, to put it another way, whatever we don't fully own.....owns
US!

Hi Jonathan,

     Yes, there's no place like OM

     You cannot freely choose (or NOT choose, for that matter) to post
"there is no free will."  In fact, I can't even choose to keep writing what
I do in response.

     The Self, seemingly, "acts" and "we," seemingly, "do the doing."

     And the dance goes on....and on.

     A very human acknowledgement:
            Jonathan, I am deeply grateful for the contributions that you
and others (Allan, Martin, Mark, Cameron, Anand, Prashant, Prasad,
Vidyasankar, Venkat, Srinivas and Gummulvru, etc.)  have been making to
these recent discussions about karma, free will, unreal actions,  etc.

       I greatly appreciate that all of you are "willing" to take the time
to openly share your thoughts and experiences about these matters.    In
your own way, you have all "enlightened" my life, and I thank you most
sincerely.

      I suppose that, in a sense, we all ARE the very path that we are walking.


                                                 With Blessings,


                                                   Chuck Hillig
