Ishwara sits[1] in the hearts[2] of all beings Arjuna.
He moves[3] all beings like an implement[4] with maya.

[1] tishtati has the connotation of immovability

[2] hrdaya here can mean the generic "center" not neccessarily the actual
heart organ.

[3] literally revolves, waves about

[4] yantra literally means a machine or instrument.  The connotation is
some tool used to perform an action.

And lest anyone think this is denying free will, in the second half
of 18.63 Krishna Bhagwan says

Considering it[1] carefully, act according to your wishes.

[1] His teachings.
