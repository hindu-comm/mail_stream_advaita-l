Last week the ListManager decided to make some changes in the List
Server setup at A&M. In the process of moving, an error was introduced
in Advaita-L setting and it resulted in locking of the file. For some
reason list owners were not informed about the moving, I was unaware
of the problem till this morning (I was away to SD for a week, so I
was checking the mail only once in a while).

CHANGES
-------

1) To send a mail to ADVAITA-L, please post your messages to

advaita-l at tamu.edu

or

advaita-l at listserv.tamu.edu

2) To make changes in your subscription options, please send the
messages to

listserv at listserv.tamu.edu

3) The new WWW address is

http://listserv.tamu.edu/archives/advaita-l.html

and now the files are upto date

4) If you have any other questions, please send the messages to
msr at tamu.edu or aum at unix.tamu.edu

List is up and running. I hope it will continue. I am sorry for the
inconvenience caused.


Thank you.

Sincerely,
Ravi
msr at tamu.edu
