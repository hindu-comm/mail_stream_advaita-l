60th birthday is considered a significant event in a human's life span.
In Hindu tradition, 60th birthday celebration - shhashhtyaabdapurti -
is considered an auspicious event. I am asked to say a few words at
a forthcoming shhashhtyaabdapurti celebration for a friend. I would be
most grateful if knowledgeable List-members provide some background
for this event and the significance of the celebration. Is the event
considered important because of the 60-year cycle of the Hindu
calendar and the person who is celebrating 60 years is going to go
through the year cycle for the second time round ? I am sure there
are other importances attached to it. Even a reference where the
significance is discussed is appreciated. I would be most grateful
for either private e-mail or discussion on the List.

Regards
Gummuluru Murthy

        The physical universe is Brahman - so says Ramana Maharshi. He said
that he only denies it's reality for beginners. I think what he is really
denying is the imposed ideas on physical reality that dualistic thinking
people have; not the reality itself.
