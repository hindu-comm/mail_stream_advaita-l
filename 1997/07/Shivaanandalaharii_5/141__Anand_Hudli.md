O Lord of souls, O All-pervading One, O Lord of Gaurii!
As the swan desires the lake full of lotuses, the chaataka bird the
dark rain-bearing clouds, the chakravaaka bird the sun, the chakora bird
the moon, so does my mind yearn for Your lotus feet which are to be
sought by the path of knowledge, and which bestow the bliss of
liberation.


Shankara describes the yearning of a devotee's heart for the lotus feet of
Shiva, by means of beautiful similes. The swan eats the stalk of the lotus
flower. So it is always longing for a lake filled with lotuses. The chaataka
bird drinks rain drops as they fall down from the clouds. It does not
drink  water in any other form. The chakravaaka pairs of birds are
supposed to be separated from each other during the night and they are
supposed to unite during the day. The chakravaaka birds, therefore, long for
the appearance of the sun. The chakora bird is supposed to live on moon
beams. The devotee's heart longs for the lotus feet of Shiva which can be
reached by the the path of knowledge. Those lotus feet of Shiva bestow the
bliss that is liberation.
