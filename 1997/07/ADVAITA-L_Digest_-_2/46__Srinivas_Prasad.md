   Nageswar rao,

  My answer is The diffrence in time , meaning Valmiki stuff happened in
  Treta yuga and as per Yuga dharma Jnana:Ajnana = 90 :10 %. This means
  Satya (Truth ) had lot of power. Where as in Kaliyuga as per yuga Dharma
  People suffer from Ajnana and it is well below or approximately
  10:90 %. If we take birth again after 500 yrs (Hope Not !!), the situation
  will be still worst.  From my conclusion Hitler was None other than a
  Asura and Kali The demon was dominating in side him.

  As Sri krishna Says in BG

  "Yada Yada hi dharmasya Jnanirbhavi bharatha..... "

  So once it the Impurity exceed the level , Sri krishna has to send some
  one to take care ( Sri krishna will not incarnate in this yuga ) of this
  world order.

  The terrorist today are none other than ASURAS ( tamasik Souls)
   I can confidently declare.
  hope I have tried my best to answer your question.

   regards
  prasad
