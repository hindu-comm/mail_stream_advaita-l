Teachers 10,000+ years have had to justify their existence somehow.

Complete purity of mind _is_  the comprehension "advaita tattva."

Well, thanks for the word "opinion".  Now tell me about his results.
Serious question.

As the father of a three year old I understand your commentary on
Nisargadatta's  "Anyone who tells you what to do is dangerous."  I imagine
N. would also.
Unfortunately your point begs the question.  The results of jumping out the
window are derivable from experience.  How one attains advaita tattva is
not (despite what any teacher might tell you.)  Such is lila, or as we in
the West call it, grace.

Teachers like Nisaargatta, Balsekar, Rajneesh, Da Free John, say many
things that are not supported by some of the traditions that have sprung up
in the name of advaita.  But then their every word (in Rajneesh's case that
extends to over 600 books) resonates and  is consistent with the
profoundest truths of  advaita, such as tat tvam asi.  Their claim to
advaita is not that they fit into a tradition, but that they are capabale
of  a coherent illumination of the key texts on which that tradition is
based.
