Which issues are beyond human intelligence? How would you decide that?

Have you established your ego with your letter?

What evidence do you have for that? Doesn't good come out of intellectual
crisis at least sometimes?

Very true. But if you've got it why not use it? It all depends on the motive
of the person. If the motive is noble then the results should be good.

Or it can help a person end ego.

Did these past dogmas come from human beings?

Ram, if you want to comment then you have to be brave and enter the email
group. I agree that this can get a bit heady and valueless sometimes but
that's how we learn. I'm sure you have a lot to contribute.

Caio for now,
