I'm afraid I must disagree with some of what you say below.

If you really believe truth is one (and I don't think anyone denies
Advaita Vedanta does), how can you accept multiple claims to truth?
Obviously only one is correct.  One way around this is to say that
different philosophies are true on different levels or from different
perspectives.  But that is still assigning validity and relative merits.

Not knowing in what context the Swami of Kanchi made that remark I cannot
speak on his motives but it should be noted that from the Brahma Sutra to
the works of Shankaracharya, to the succesive heads of the Kanchi maths
themselves, the history of the Advaita parampara is full of such debates.
Now all of a sudden they've become futile?  Perhaps nowadays people are
more ignorant and most are not intellectually equipped to engage in debate
but that is the fault of the debaters not the issues that need debating.

There are many ways in which a sound intellect can enrich spiritual life.
Doubt is the major obstacle on the path to Moksha.  Just as a strong
person finds it easier to swim in a torrent than a weakling a person who
is strengthened by logic will find it much easier to withstand the
perturbations of the mind than an irrational one.

There are some people on this list who are pretty ignorant even downright
delusional but at least since I've been reading it I don't think I've met
anyone who I felt was insincere.  Unfortunately good intentions != truth
but at least by asking questions people may find there way to truth.  So I
don't know what these debates to establish ego that you're refering to
are.  But there have been debates to ascertain truth and this is a good
thing.  Advaita Vedanta makes some pretty big claims and it is right and
proper for people to try and determine their validity.  People who accept
things creduously end up trying to hitch rides on comets.

Then, again, it is the fault of the debaters for not conducting the debate
properly.  A proper debate will illuminate and explain.  And I think for
the most part we have had proper debates here.

It doesn't have to be an either/or.  Use of the intellect can be the
expression of faith.

Then all of the Advaita parampara is arrogant because that is exactly what
we claim.

well I know I cannot--for now.  But I can hope that one day I will.  I
cannot stop trying just because the task is arduous.

Why would the Kanchi math have established pathashalas where Brahman boys
"waste" their time on learning the shastras and debate if its leaders
thought it was of no value?

What you neglect to mention is the miracle was only supposed to happen
_for_the_one_with_the_greatest_intellect.  It was only after Shankaracharya
proved he was the master of all fields of knowledge--even kama shastra by
entering the body of the dead Raja of Kashmir--that the miracle could
occur.

The greatest expositor of the role of faith in Vedanta is Swami Madhusudana
Saraswati and it worthy to note he is also the author of one of the most
famous polemical works of our darshan called Advaitasiddhi.

No they don't.  Vedanta as the name suggests makes its stand on the Vedas
and considers the Vedas alone as truth.  Advaita Vedanta suggests that the
ritual vidhis in the karmakanda are not useful for jnana but it in no way
denies their validity or suggests they are not the last word in their own
sphere of influence.

>From the standpoint of physics it doesn't matter if the teacher is
incompetent or not or if the student doubts him or not.  The laws of
physics are laws because they do _not_ depend on the presence of an
observer.  Similiarly the Vedic conception of Dharma is more than the
situational ethics of a particular group of people.  It is the very law of
nature and one cannot dismiss it anymore than one can dismiss the law of
gravity.  The only innovation Vedanta adds here is that the Jnani is not
bound by Dharma but even for him it is hardly irrelevant.  As long as he
is in any kind of position of having to deal with other people, he is
bound by the laws of Dharma.  This is how the Shankaracharya can be
simultaneously renouncers and "Jagad"gurus.

Vedanta being the Uttara Mimamsa employs the Mimamsaka method of rigorous
logical analysis of text.  It is through this method that the shastras are
interpreted.  Intuition has no place in Vedanta and faith needs only to be
faith in the method.

With the information we have at our disposal we can definitely say _many_
religions and dogmas are wrong.  There are still some disagreements left
outstanding but we have hope we will eventually resolve them.

I hope so too but unless we are prepared to use our brains there aren't
going to be any new insights.

Certainly!  We are human beings not lemmings and there are a lot of
charlatans out there.

As long as someone is within the confines of earthly existance they will
not be able to show 100% of what it means to be realized but they can
still show the way.  The problem with jnana isn't that it is not
understood but that most people don't have the will to do what is required
of them.
