Probably because the academic world can only get an idea of post-Sankaran
advaita from the written texts. In itself, this might be a Western
cultural legacy (Judeo-Christian?) where greater value is attached to the
written word than to oral instruction. In traditional Vedanta, of course,
the personal instruction obtained from a guru is of the utmost importance.

Well, Indian academics tend to follow the lead of the Western academics...

Agehananda's views are certainly prArabdha-vaSAt! Given his varied
history, one cannot expect him to be very true to the advaita tradition.

Also, I think a distinction must be made between true advaitins and those
sannyAsins who are originally from the advaita tradition, but hold
completely different philosophies. AnandatIrtha (aka madhva) is one of the
earliest examples.
