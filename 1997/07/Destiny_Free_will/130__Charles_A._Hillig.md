Hi Prasad,

     But are you in MY video tape or am I in YOURS?

     If linear time is just a brilliant illusion, then perhaps the entire
"tape" is constantly being "projected" in its absolute totality every single
micro-second.

      If that's true, then apparent differences between past, present and
future disappear into the Eternal Now.
