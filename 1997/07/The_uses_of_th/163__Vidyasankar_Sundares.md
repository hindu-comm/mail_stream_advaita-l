It was not Sri Ramana's intention to say that the fire should be partially
covered, allowing the possibility of backdraft. What he says is, don't
feed it with more fuel.

The basic idea is not to completely dam the desires, which can lead to a
dangerous accumulation. What is always taught is the regulation of desires
- don't torture yourself by restraining them artifically, but at the same
time, don't let them to roam unrestrained or overindulge them.
