Does anyone know if this text has been included in the collected editions
of Sankara's works, published under the guidance of the Sringeri Acharyas
from 1910 onwards? I've read that the only "Tantric" text to be included
in this collection is the prapancasAra, on which there are commentaries by
some 16th or 17th century authors.

Non-inclusion of a text in this collection has been used by some modern
scholars to argue against its authenticity. Although inclusion does not
legitimate a text in their eyes, this would be a useful piece of
information to know.
