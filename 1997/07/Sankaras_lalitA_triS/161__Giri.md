Namaste Vidya:

        See Volume 5. Hope this information is of some use to you.
Further, you may note that Kanchi perivaya used to refer to LTB as a work
by Shankara. Please also let Rama know that LTB may not satisfy Hacker's
criteria because there is a citation of a "non-authentic" upanishhad.h,
kaula.
