What does this person think destiny to be? Is it the fact that the world
is causal and therefore every "action" is linked to some others (with its
associated complexities). But that "he" (or his unified consciousness)
lies untouched and *inactive*.
If this be the case (i.e. the person doesnot see his self) then don't
you think it is pointless to even talk of destiny, which presupposes that
there is a "self" (howsoever ethereal) whose "destiny" is to be
determined.
Or is destiny some kind of a "verbal stance" that the "jnani" takes to
convey his impressions of the material world to his fellow beings?

Prashant.
