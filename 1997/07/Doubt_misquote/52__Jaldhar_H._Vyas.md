I agree.  The sanshayatma Krishna Bhagavan is describing is the type of
person who never wants to confront a problem.  It is useful to look at the
context of the Bhagavad Gita here.  It is the prelude to battle and Arjuna
has suddenly lost his nerve.  Now if Krishna Bhagavan had just picked up
some person at random and told them to kill 18 lakh people, one could
understand the confusion.  But Arjuna is born in the warrior caste in a
royal family.  Since childhood he has had instruction in warcraft from
teachers like Dronacharya and Krpacharya.  Such a person cannot
complain they are unprepared for war.  His "doubts" are actually based on
cowardice and hypocrisy.  By the end of the Gita, he still has doubts and
questions but they are based on a desire to understand the truth not to
hide from it.
