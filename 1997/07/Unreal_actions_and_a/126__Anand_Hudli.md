 When the "we" that is limited by space and time dies, the real "we" free
 from all limitations will remain. This real "we" cannot die and is
 immortal. So we (the limited one) should not be afraid that there will
 be nothing left. Unlimited happiness *is* the unlimited "we", as the
 shruti affirms. No problem in asking loudly for mokshha. We have nothing
 to lose!
