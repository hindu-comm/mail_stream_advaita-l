Yes! exactly. Since the content is the same in both the cases we
need that additional ripeness factor. I was trying to get at that.
Also, oncethe mind is ready, practically anything can serve as the
wake up call, although scriptures are the clarion calls. 

Is there a similar illustration for waking up straight from the 
deep sleep state without a dream intervention? Since there is no 
content in such a case, what serves to wake one up? I am curious!
