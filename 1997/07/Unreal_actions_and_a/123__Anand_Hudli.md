  Several problems here. Brahman is not just a passive, inert entity. It
  is Infinite Bliss/Happiness. What maayaa can offer is only limited
  happiness, limited by many factors such as time, space, etc. Inherently,
  we seek eternal happiness without any restrictions/limitations. That is
  why the Chhaandogya upanishhad says:

   naalpe sukhamasti

   There is no happiness in that which is small. There is no point in
   going after small things. We are not little boys anymore, when we
   were happy with little things. :-)

   yo vai bhuumaa tatsukhaM

   That which is big (offers) happiness.

   All happiness in the phenomenal world is finite and limited. What we
   are looking for is happiness that is desha-kaala-aadi-anavachchhinna ,
   not limited by space, time, etc. We want be happy wherever we go, and
   we want to be happy all the time. And we want the happiness to never
   end. Even Bill Gates can't get that kind of happiness here!

  By all means, worship Shiva. He will lead you to a Guru.

  You are right.
