      Ah, yes!    And therein lies the rub!   How can you survive as a
separate entity (and also see "others" as separate, too)  AND be
"enlightened" (whatever THAT means) at the same time?

      Isn't it a contradiction for a separate "you" to "be there" as the
so-called "experiencer" of such a non-differentiated state?

     We pretend that we're not pretending to pretend.....by pretending!

      I certain agree with Allan.  Shiva (and whatever he/she/it
personifies), has been  an important part of my life, too.

     Yes, yes, yes!

     Nothing HAS  happened,
                        IS  happening,
                               or ever WILL  happen!
