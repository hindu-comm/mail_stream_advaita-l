Which reminds me of a discussion I had a few years ago with a friend.
He told me likewise that a ferocious tiger woke him up from a dream.
In my experience, I had terrifying dreams but did not wake up always.
The dream sometimes transforms into another kind of dream. So my
question is as follows: is the waking up due to the content of the
dream or something else? (this is not a frivolous question)
