Hi Martin

     The Self "thinks" and the illusory "you" SEEMS to be having the thoughts.

     But any so-called conflict is only in the "I" of the beholder.

     But maybe there is no real "goal" to be arguing about.  For that
matter, maybe such arguments are also illusory.  Maybe there's only the Self.

     But, by WHOM?

     WHO is there who is going to get rid of this sense of separation.

      Can you really be present as a witness to your own awakening?

     Yes, the illusion of violence does, seemingly, come and go.

>>Q. ...violence may not really be the problem at all.

>I disagree. When you see violence do you just say "all is one" and leave it

>Surely most of us do.?

     When I have seen violence, it's always been appropriate for me to try
to stop it in any way I can....even though nothing is really "wrong."

     Actually, at any time.

     The thought of separation is still a thought.  But then you still have
to deal with the Thinker of this thought.  Who is that?

     To be against anything is to validate its apparent separation.

     If the oneness has always been there, then the problems were never
really present either.


                                   With Blessings,
