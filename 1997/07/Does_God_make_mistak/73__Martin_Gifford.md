..........But if a violent thought occurs it comes from the illusion of
separation. If that comes from the Self in Oneness (impossible) then we may
as well go to Adolph Hitler for satsang.

..........Then what are we talking about?

automatically.

.............There is no awakening. There is only the dispelling of darkness.

violent others!

............The primary belief of difference is before the violence. If
there was no belief in difference there couldn't be any violence.

.............Fair enough. I should say when harmony meets disharmony the
harmony wins because it is the nature of Oneness.

..............I can think all soughts of things, and experience problems and
suffer, or I can realise a line of thought is wrong and stop it. So to with
the Self.
