..............No. But the blood flows more harmoniously in the artery called
Jnani than it does in the artery called Ajnani.

...............No. Are any of us fully present in ourselves/actions, etc?
And what is the point of realisation, talk etc. I'm sure you'll say it's
just a story told by Itself to Itself. Why would it bother? It must have bad
taste! I think It is trying to manifest fully in the physical plane.

................Absolutely not. Does a Jnani become a Hitler. Aren't things
getting better?

With these recent emails it seems to me the list is going mad!

Now I read that we should all just throw ourselves into our roles. Aren't we
already throwing ourselves into our roles? Can we do anything else according
to that line of reasoning??

Either everything is perfect as it is (NOT!) or duality is the problem and
Advaita is the answer!

Martin.
