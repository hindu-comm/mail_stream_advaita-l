"Does God make mistakes?"

A colleague in grad school did his doctoral dissertation on this.  His
answer was NO.  Because (he argued) God doesn't DO anything.

In intro philosophy people argue about the Judeo-Christian conception of
omnipotence and God.  If He can make a mistake (the argument goes), he's
not omnipotent; if He cannot make a mistake, then he's not omnipotent.
