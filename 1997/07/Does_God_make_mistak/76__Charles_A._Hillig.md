Hi Martin,

     Do you think that the Self REALLY distinguishes between so-called
"constructive" ideas and so-called "destructive" ideas?

     Isn't any discrimination only to be noticed from the point of view of
the illusory ego?

                              With Blessings,

                                    Chuck Hillig
