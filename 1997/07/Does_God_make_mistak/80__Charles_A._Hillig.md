Hi Martin,

     But, Martin, where does the one who is doing the "contacting" end and
the so-called separated thing that is being "contacted" begin if everything
is truly ONE?
Isn't it ALL illusory.....much like images on a movie screen?

     To continue with your analogy, though, perhaps it is the very same
artery.  The Self makes no such distinctions between "harmony" and
"disharmony."  Things are such as they are.  All stratifications are only
for the illusory ego to make.

     But the Self is already "here" on the so-called "physical plane."    I
mean, where ELSE would (or could) It possibly be?    It is always 100% fully
manifested at every second in all of these illlusory planes.

      Believing that It's NOT, however, provides the momentum to seemingly
propel our life's story "forward" and out into some kind of illusory
"future" where we can go looking for this Self.    But, in truth, we already
are who we are looking for.

     You ask "what is the point of realization, talk, etc.?"  Actually,
there is no point to it at all.  But, then again, what is the "point" of a
tree or of a sunset?

      It is what It is.  We seemingly "do" what we seemingly "do"  (e.g.
talk,  work, play, strive to be enlightened, etc.)

     But we are not the "doer-of-the-doing."  The Self  "does" It all.

     There is no "becoming" here.  There's just the pure consciousness of
"Be-ing."  Remember that an author loves his villains every bit as much as
he loves his heroes.    No matter what (or how) It appears, It's really all OK.


>With these recent emails it seems to me the list is going mad!

     (How fun!)


>Now I read that we should all just throw ourselves into our roles. Aren't we
>already throwing ourselves into our roles?

     Maybe our resistence to our role is in direct proportion to the
strength of our ego.
It's NOT the role that we are playing.  It's only the attachment to the role
that creates the bondage.

>Either everything is perfect as it is (NOT!) or duality is the problem and
>Advaita is the answer!

     Things are neither "perfect" nor "imperfect."  They just ARE what they ARE.
If you see duality as a "problem," then your answer to it is "non-duality."

     But the Self cannot be "contained."   So perhaps the best answer to all
of our (mad) musings lies somewhere within the profound Silence that falls
between our empty words.

                                           With Blessings,

                                                   Chuck Hillig
