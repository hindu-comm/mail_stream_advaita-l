Just one single sun dispels the darkness that pervades earth and
heaven and becomes visible (to the eyes). But Your brilliance is
more than a crore (10 million) suns! Why do You not become known
then (O Lord)? Oh! How dense should the darkness of my ignorance
be! Destroy all that ignorance of mine and do become directly
manifest, O Pashupati (Lord of souls).


Shankara brings out an important point in this verse. The Self,
Atman which is identical with Brahman, is not fully known even
though Its brilliance exceeds that of anything conceivable. The
analogy usually given is the cloudy sky in the presence of the
sun. Even though we cannot see the sun which is being obscured
by the clouds, we can still discern the presence of the sun
behind those clouds by the dimly shining clouds. It is only
after the clouds vanish do we see the sun as it is. In fact, as soon
as the clouds are gone, we do not have to make any effort to see
the sun. It becomes manifest itself. Any effort or action is only
concerned with the removal of the clouds.

When the clouds are present, we cannot say that we do not feel the
presence of the sun. We cannot say that we see the sun either. In a
similar fashion, the Self is never completely obscured even in the
state of ignorance. But It is not completely manifest in the state
of ignorance. VidyaaraNya, in his Panchadashii, gives another
example. When a father listens to his son's chanting the Vedas in
a chorus of boys, the father can recognize the fact that his son
is chanting with the other boys. But the father cannot clearly
perceive the distinguishing characteristics of his son's voice.
In this case, the voices of the other boys cause the voice of his
son to be obscured, but not completely.

So we are, in the state of ignorance, victims of this paradoxical
situation where the Self is known and yet not known.

VidyaaraNya makes this point in the very first chapter of the
Panchadashii:

abhaane na paraM prema bhaane na vishhaye spR^ihaa |
ato bhaane .apyabhaataa .asau paramaanandataatmanaH ||

If the Self is not revealed then there would not have been
the supreme love for Its bliss (happiness). If the Self is
(fully) revealed then there would not have been a desire for
objects of sense enjoyment. Therefore, we can say that the
true blissful nature of the Self is revealed and yet not
revealed!

Everyone loves eternal happiness or eternal bliss. At the same
time, those of us who are in ignorance, love the objects of
sense enjoyment. Is this not paradoxical? This paradoxical
situation leads to the state where the Self is known and
yet not known. This paradox is the result of beginningless
maayaa or avidyaa. It is only when this avidyaa is removed
that the Self will shine in all Its glory.

Here Shankara appeals to Brahman as God to remove the dense darkness
of ignorance of Brahman as jiiva (soul) so that Brahman as Itself
becomes manifest.
