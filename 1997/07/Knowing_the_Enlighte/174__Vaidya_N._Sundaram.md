Hi,
 I have just requested that I be added to the list. I was going through
the logs of previous discussions on the web, and am intrigued by the
discussion on how an enlightened being recognizes it. In this regard I
have a few questions/comments and would be glad to have a clarification.
 1) Is Supreme Knowledge not characterized as ' Knowing that which every
thing else is Known' ? Would it not then be self evident to the
Enlightened, that he/she is indeed at the state of awareness? Would such
a person need any further confirmation?
 2) (More importantly to me) Would it even matter? Is not the state of
Knowing Bliss, where everything else is secondary and mundane?

 My comment is this:
 I have heard from scholars the following phrase in Tamil:
         " kandavar vindillar
                vindavar kandilar "
 meaning : those who have Seen (the Reality) have not spoken
                those who speak have not seen.
 In this context, would an acknowledgement be 'complete' ?

If discussions on the same questions have already taken place, I
would be grateful if I could have the log entries and I would look it up
on the web.

Cheers and GOD Bless,
 vaidya.
