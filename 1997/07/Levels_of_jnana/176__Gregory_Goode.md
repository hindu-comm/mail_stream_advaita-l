Many teachers say that the momentary interludes of non-dual awareness are
pointers to the non-dual consciousness that we truly are.  Many also say that
unbroken non-dual awareness doesn't preclude day-to-day activities from
going on.  Ramana ate, slept, conversed, walked, answered to names he was
addressed by, etc.  Some teachers say that thoughts and feelings occur but
are not taken as reality.

I like to think that there is no thought that can occur that can falsify
the truth of who we really are.  We are THAT, whether we see things that
way or not.  Of course to say this and believe this is not the same as
residing in non-dual awareness!

So I agree with Allan that:
