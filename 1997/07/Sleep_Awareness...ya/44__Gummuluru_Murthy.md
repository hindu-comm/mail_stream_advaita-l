My understanding is the following:

We are not experiencing being Brahman in the deep sleep state. In the
deep sleep state, our sense organs (which are always externally directed)
are simply folded and do not experience the world. That does not mean
they are experiencing Brahman. The sense organs CANNOT experience
Brahman. Brahman cannot be experienced. You are Brahman is the true state.
The rest are all experiences.

So true. However, what is the difference between a non-realized person
and a Realized person still embodied ? The body of the realized person
still has to go through the bodily functions. This includes the daily
ablutions, nightly sleep and other activities. The difference is, the
realized person does not see these activities as part of Him, but are
simply what the body has to go through. The realized person separates
the body and its functions and the mind from the SELF which He/She is.
We, the non-realized persons identify with the bodily functions as ours
and go through sensual pleasures and suffering and identify them as ours.

You seem to be viewing an embodied realized person as one walking with a
hollow (spelling ?) around. I do not think that is appropriate (from my
understanding). Take Shri Ramana Maharshi as an example. The body went
through the various functions as other humans including surgery etc. The
only difference is He did not regard it as He going through either surgery
or other activities. Beyond that outlook, rest is the same.
