I believe the word you were looking for is halo, not hollow.

Sarvebhyo namaskaaraH!

I cannot recall to my memory a subhaashhita I read somewhere. It was a
sophisticated verse taking advantage of the ambiguity of the word "guNa"
(merit and bowstring). Like an arrow which is released (mucyate) by
means of a guNa (as bowstring), a soul is liberated by its guNas
(merits). It was something like this. Can anyone help me find the verse
and, perhaps, its author?
