This topic is not to be taken lightly!  Just this week I've been talking
and reading about the disagreement between Andrew Cohen and his guru
Papaji that Cohen publicized in his book _Autobiography_of_an_Awakening_.
Cohen's issue is whether an awakened or enlightened one would act so as
to hurt others.  He says NO, that enlightenment entails ahimsa and also
a great deal of integrity (living not conflicting with dharma).  He
attributes to Papaji and others the view that there are still some
vAsanas that get burnt out, but that they have nothing to do with the
actor even if they can affect other people.  Cohen says that anyone
living in this adharmic way is not enlightened.

I heartily agree with this paragraph.  As profound a view as this is
(and for me, difficult to arrive at), it IS held by some who think that
nothing they do is wrong.  But there are lots of other views that foster
irresponsible behavior, such as the different species of "God told me
to do this!"
