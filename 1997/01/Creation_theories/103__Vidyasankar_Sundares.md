Gladly. If you find the material useful, please do not hesitate to make
use of it. I have also put a modified version of the post I sent to this
list at the advaita website, at
<http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~vidya/advaita/creation.html>.

SrIharsha's khaNDana-khaNDa-khAdya has been published many times in the
Sanskrit original. I am not aware of translations. SrIharsha's
naishAda-kAvya, which is a poem on the Nala-Damayanti story, has been
published with translations, commentaries etc. citsukha has written a
commentary called abhiprAya-prakASikA, on maNDana miSra's brahmasiddhi,
the bhAva-tattva-prakASikA on sureSvara's naishkarmyasiddhi, and an
independent work called tattvapradIpikA, also known as citsukhI.
sukhaprakASa has commented on SrIharsha's khaNDana-khaNDA-khAdya, I think.
Usually, the publishers who publish such works are the Universities of
Madras and Mysore, Chowkhamba (Varanasi), Motilal Banarasidass (Delhi) and
Chetana (Bombay).

The general opinion about these works is that they are very difficult, and
are only read at a very advanced level. SrIharsha, especially, revels in
difficult language constructions, and himself says that his work is
difficult to understand without proper guidance from an expert guru. There
is a fairly decent account of the issues they handle in S. N. Dasgupta's
History of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 2.
