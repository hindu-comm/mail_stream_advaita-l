  One usually comes across polemic and explantory books on advaita. Books
  of the former type are harder to understand and involve refutation of
  other schools and defense of advaita against objections of schools.
  Sriharsha's khaNdanaKhaNDakhaadya and chitsukhi belong to this type.
  The explanatory treatises are more suitable if one is looking for a
  good introduction to advaita. Some of the best known works are Shankara's
  vivekachuuDaamaNi and the upadeshasaahasrii, and VidyaaraNya's
  Panchadashii. There are also other minor works attributed to Shankara,
  such as Atmabodha, aparokshhaanubhuuti, and mahaavaakyadarpaNa.
