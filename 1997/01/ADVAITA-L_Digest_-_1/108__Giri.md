        The owner of the above link fails to mention that the complete
page has been picked from my site without any attribution. You can see
the "original" page at
        http://www.geocities.com/RodeoDrive/1415/bhaja1.html
Since the verses were translated by me, there may be a few errors.
Namaste.
