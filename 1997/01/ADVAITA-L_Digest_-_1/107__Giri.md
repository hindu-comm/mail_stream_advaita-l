        There are some translations in English. Our library has the one
by P.E. Granoff. Have also come across a translation by Ganganatha Jha.
Jha has translated several advaitic works including the advaita siddhi
of Madhusudana Sarasvati. I think the author of the book 'A source book
of Advaita vedanta.' cites a source for another translation.

        Though 'A source book of Advaita vedanta' states that citsukhii
has not been translated into english, Swami Satprakashnanda cites the work
in his book 'Methods of Knowledge [thro' advaita vedanta]' and gives a
Bombay publisher as his source.

        On an other note, the ekajivavada and the theory of drishti-shristi
which closely parellels the modern day "subjective realism" [Perception
is creation] has been explained by Prakashananda in his work
vedanta siddhanta muktavali, which has also been translated into english.
Of course, this theory does not have a large following among advaitins.
