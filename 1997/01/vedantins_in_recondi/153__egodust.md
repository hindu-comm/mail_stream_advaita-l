Are these vedantins?
(catch the free spirit lovejolt):


"I am He as you are He
as you are me
and we are all together..."
       --John Lennon


"I wish I could write you
a melody so plain
that can hold you dear lady
from going insane,
that could ease you and cool you
and cease the pain
of your useless and pointless knowledge!"
       --Dylan


"It's all in your mind;
don't let it dwell on these things..."
       --Hendrix


"All our souls are deeper
than you can see,
you can have everything
if you let yourself be."
       --Donovan


"And the next time that we meet
        will be a re-run,
        you'll say 'be ONE...'
Oh if you could only trust,
someday, you know you really must,
try it...try it...mmmm you
better try it!"
       --Richie Havens

Freedom is what we're after.
Freedom is what we ARE......
