Very well expressed.  It is, in my view, statements like these, which
makes this Group very worthwhile.

This has also relevane to a comment I made earlier in this thread (in a
separate context) and I repeat the comments below.

"....

I do not deny the usefulness and importance of Ishwara and karma-phala,
just like Newtonian physics. But, we cannot stop there. Somehow, we
always seem to stop at this stage without going that extra step (a leap
forward).

My feeling is: vyavahara stage of advaita is like an armchair
quarterback. We simply analyse and analyse without having the
courage to experience it.

make that leap forward ? Is it in our hands at all to take that extra
step ?
