Except you haven't defined what 'it' is.  Pain is universal, every human
being (possibly every animal and plant) has experienced it.  So far we
haven't determined if meditation even exists.  If we come across a

much in the way of tenacity or desperation as very little effort needs to
be made to refute patent illogic.
