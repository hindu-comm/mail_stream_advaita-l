:-) No, as with the pain in the arm, you can try on yourself, what it is.

Oh, yes, that's fine with me. Just I can promise you, that when your
present limited
identity will vanish into Brahman will be no way mistaking it, simply
because the one who could mistake it will have vanished. Promise.
And I also wish to assure you, that you don't have to take it from me, and
that you don't have to fight for your convictions with so desperate a
strangle hold. No one is
trying to snatch them from you. :-) We are just amicably sharing our own
believes and convictions, which is what this group is for, after all.
(No hard feelings.)

Om and Shanti,

Swami Vishvarupananda
