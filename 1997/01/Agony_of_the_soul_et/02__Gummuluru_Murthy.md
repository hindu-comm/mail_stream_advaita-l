I beg to differ. I have followed the arguments in that thread closely. I
have no intention of re-opening the arguments or participate in that
thread. But, allow me to make the following general comments.

In any arguments or discussion, the motives can be of various types and
they were mentioned in some other context. They, roughly, are

(a) to gain some knowledge and learn something
(b) to defend one's position
(c) to find the weak points of the opponent and try to vanquish the
opponent
(d) to completely not hear the others' arguments and to go on one-sided
track.

The only objective of a true practitioner of Advaita is to gain stillness
of the mind by seeing oneness in all. There is no need of one-upmanship by
vernacular juglery. [Shri Shankara is excluded from this definition
because His mission is different.]. If a person gains peace of mind by
being dvaitin, so be it.

I clearly remember and try to practice Shri Chinmayananda's explanation
(which might have followed Shri Ramana's teachings). Every argument is
correct at the level of understanding of the person who makes it. Leave
it to the person to recognize the Truth in his/her own time. At that time,
the person will see for himself/herself the fallacy of the arguments that
were made.

Reading technical treatises on advaita or dvaita and parroting the views
does not make any difference. Only when a person's mind is properly tuned,
the knowledge will pour in from all directions. If the mind is not tuned,
however much of reading does not take a person anywhere. When or how and
by whom the mind is tuned is a mystery (to me).

Yes, the jiva enveloped in maaya thinks that I is the body and the mind
and thinks is doing all the actions. Hence the attributions of
the emotions to the wrong source. But once you recognize what you are, the
emotions themselves vanish.

Here, I have to differ from you. This was discussed to the full a few
months ago. Being a grihastha and doing one's dharma as a grihastha
without being entwined in it is not fatalism and shirking of one's duty.
