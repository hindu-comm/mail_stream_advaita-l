I see Sri Jaldhar H. Vyas's interpretation of what the two greate swamis
have said.  In my twelve years of vedantic study and anlysis, I have not
found any disagreement between what Bhagavan Sankara worte and what Swami
Chinmayaananda interpreted. Now I am baffled who is the neo-vedantin here!
and which is that unstble path that the two swamis philosophized!

Stability and unstability is the state of mind, I am that which supports
both. Both swamis taught us to renounce the mind that goes through stable
and unstable states and discover oneself as that substratum, that peace
that passeth understanding!

Hari Om!
