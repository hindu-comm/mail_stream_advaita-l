So you do take their word for it that the Vedas are nitya and apaurusheya.
That was exactly the point I was trying to make. Ultimately you do have to
take someone's word for something.

What I meant to say is, logic is relative. In physics e.g. the logic
applied to cosmological phenomena does not proof valid in particle physics
and vice versa. So, our logic is always based on a set of concepts
and an angle of view. It is nothing absolute. It is as I said relative. And
therefore the basis of the direction logic has taken in a certain course
can fall. Moreover, talking on the Vedas you cannot claim that they are
presented with a view to appeal to logic. They are very symbolic.
Even apart from this I don't believe logic is a means for determining truth
in the absolute sense. The Transcendental is beyond logic and illogic,
both, because they belong to Avidya. Yes, Shankaracharya tries very much to
appeal to logic, in order to bring it to us in a language we understand,
and yes, logic can be of great help. But in the ultimate realization of
Truth it has to drop away.

Om,
Swami Vishvarupananda
