     But, Jaldhar, what "other" people?

     There's just the Self and the "you-who-you-think-you-are."
      There's only God and "God unrealized."

     I can understand your thoughts about teachers and fools, but, in truth,
there may not be a difference between them.

     Everyone I meet (no matter how "foolish") and everything that happens
to me (no matter how "horrible") is the guru's teaching.   Everything is a
gift, but, in this case, the gift-giver, the gift itself and the one who
receives the gift are exactly the same.

                                                             With Blessings,
