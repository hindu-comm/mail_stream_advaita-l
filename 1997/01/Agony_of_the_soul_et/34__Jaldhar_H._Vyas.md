Ultimately any system of logic depends on certain postulates which cannot
be proven but even those can be known and understood.  It is only in that
extremely restricted area that you have to take anything on faith alone.
The mystics would have us declare vast areas off-limits to thinking when
in fact rational thought is valid there.

What you are saying is that a certain system of logic can have a
restricted domain.  That is not the same as saying it is relative.
cosmological laws do not become invalid when you start looking at particle
physics, they become less practically useful but if you wanted to you
could describe particle physics in terms of them. Similiarly logic might
not be capable of mapping Brahman to the full extant but it can still
describe it to you.

The Vedas describe actions in the Karma kanda and Brahman in the Jnana
kanda.  These are all concrete things not symbolic at all.

It is nevertheless the best method we have.
