Call me uncharitable but it's more likely due to lingering embarrasment
over the inability to answer Shrisha Rao.  At least some good has come out
of it.  I have begun reading Advaitasiddhi of Swami Madhusudana Saraswati
which answers those criticisms in detail.

Sukha and Dukha are only felt by the jiva enveloped in maya.  At this
point the atma and ahamkara are indistinct.

The only way to avoid sukha and dukha is through sannyasa.  For a
grihastha (like Arjuna who asked a similiar question) such fatalism is a
shirking of ones duty.  Far from being a neutral act, such inaction
destroys Dharma and brings about evil.

The deluded jiva thinks rebirth is real.  It thinks these births are
caused by the fruits of karma.  When jnana is achieved, then only can you
say there is no creation and no rebirth.

It doesn't neccessarily take shorter.  Vishnu Bhagawan offered the choice.
If He had said 3 lives as a devotee and 10 lives as an enemy, Jaya and
Vijaya would have chosen to be devotee.  Because a true Bhakta wants
nothing more than to remain at Bhagawans feet and if perchance he should
be dislodged, he desires nothing more than to return there by the quickest
route possible even if it should be at great personal cost.  This is the
inner meaning.
