What is the nature of meditation?  You say it involves something more than
intellect.  On what basis do you make that claim?  I think it is pretty
obvious Shankaracharya does not regard yogic insight as a valid pramana.
He prescribes the understanding of vakyas such as tattvamasi and reflection
upon them.  This reflection is what is meant by meditation and I don't see
why anything more than ordinary intellect is needed to practice it.

One minor point.  In most disciplines, a doctorate is the beginning of
serious research.  Still your point is taken.  The inner contemplation you
mention is not something that is immediately achievable and even when
acheived is not always sustainable.  The benefit of the study of shastras
is the strengthening and purification of the mind without which the
discipline of contemplation is impossible.  This too is not different from
any other discipline.  The Physicist or chemist who does not open a book
after research will lose his skills and knowledge over time or find they
have become obsolete.

Nevertheless even Mahayana espouses momentariness.  And as far as Advaita
is concerned, what is impermanant is illusionary.  If the Mahayanists are
saying all is impermanent, they are saying all is illusion and that is
nihilism.

I freely concede to being one-sided.  There is so much to learn in Vedanta
without wasting time with superfluous distractions.  The only aspects of
these other philosophies that interest me are the ones that impact on my
own studies.  Still if you have some new insight I'd be happy to hear (and
evaluate) it.
