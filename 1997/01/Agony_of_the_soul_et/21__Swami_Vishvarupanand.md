Dear Jaldhar,
If you are that sure and desperate, why don't you drop everything here and
now and run to take sannyasa? Is not your vigorous engagement in this
debate without taking immediate sannyasa a bit ironic? ;-)
Yes, a samsari has no chance. But a person engaged in the world physically,
while remaining detached within is not exactly a samsari, is he?

Greetings,
Swami Vishvarupananda
