This reminds me Ramayana.   There, Maricha, being very much affraid of Srirama,
explains his mental situation to Ravana.

"vRUkshE vRUkshEca paSyAmi ceera kRUshNAginaMbaraM"

He says "I am terrified, I can see Srirama in each and every tree"

It is very much true.  When we are afraid of someone; or of some situation
we inevitably think of
it again and again.

Regards
Madhava
