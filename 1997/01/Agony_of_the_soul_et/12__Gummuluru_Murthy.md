I am most grateful to Shri Vidyasankar for two thoughtful presentations in
this thread. I like to respond to the various points raised.

1. Agony of the soul (?)

I see Shri Vidyasankar's point. For a beginning student, like me,
sometimes, this causes uncertainty, with various acaryas (from various
schools of thought) using the word "soul" with different meanings.
Confining to advaitic thinking only, what would be the answer to my
original question ? Isn't it the ego that feels the emotions ?

2. Do not seek anything (happiness or sadness)

Shri Vidyasankar interprets my question as due to thamasic laziness rather
than sattvic nirapeksha. Implicit in this interpretation seems to be the
belief (seems to be held by Shri Vidyasankar and many others) that one
cannot have nirapeksha unless one literally takes up sannyasa ashrama.
I do not subscribe to that thinking. I believe that a person can be
completely free from all shackles right in the middle of a city,
surrounded by family. In my view, there is no need of sannyasa ashrama
for nirapeksha (not seek anything, neither happiness nor sadness).

There indeed seems to be some confusion here. I think Shri Vidyasankar
mis-read my posting as well as Shri Vyas'. I am not advocating inaction.
I am advocating performing one's duty without getting entwined in it.

I argue for: Being a grihastha and doing one's duties without getting
entwined in the intricacies (a la King Janaka) is possible.

Shri Vyas argues: Being in samsara leads to sukha and dukha and the only
way to be away from sukha and dukha is to take literal sannyasa ashrama.

I argue that a literal sannyasa (sannyasis as we see in India) does not
mean anything. Manasa sannyasa, exemplified by the grihastha in the above
example is as superior a state as the literal sannyasa which Shri Vyas
favours.

I could not grasp Shri Vidyasankar's view on this point from his posting.

I think I used the word "definition" inappropriately in my earlier
posting. Further, I mean to differentiate between Shri Shankara and other
great acaryas on one hand and the mere mortals and List members on the
other. My statement is not, in any way intended to belittle the
contributions of post- or pre-Shankara acaryas. I cannot put myself as
having the same mission as the great acaryas, contrary to what Shri Vyas
says. Thus, my attempt to differentiate. I see now, it might have caused
other castigations on great acaryas (other than Shri Shankara) for which
I regret. It is not what is intended.

Stillness of mind, in my view, is not inoperation of the mind. I used
the phrase "stillness of the mind" to mean curbing the wandering nature
of the mind. Once the wandering nature is stopped, it will gain peace
concentrating all the time on Brahman, the ultimate reality. That does
not mean inoperation, but simply being in the control of I.

There have been discussions between dualists and non-dualists from time
immemorial. If the discussion is taking place with an open mind, I am all
for it. I am afraid, the minds had been made up and vanquishing the
opponent (or turning the other person to one's own line of thinking)
seems to be the only goal. The recent discussion on this topic in our
List (the thread: "An interesting article: Any response ?) is a good
example.

I believe in the truth of advaita. That truth need not be defended. It
always prevails. I would like others to be benifitted by the recognition
of the truth as well. But that truth has to dawn on them. Advaita jnana
will be showered on a person with an open mind wishing to enquire into
the truth, not on a person who wishes to propogatean already-set dvaitin
mind. The time when that advaita varsha will shower on the person is
pre-ordained. If a debate is the trigger that causes that shower, the
debate shall take place. I am not advocating what anyone do or not do.
If a person feels duty-bound to get into a debate, so be it. It has been
pre-ordained in any case, what is to take place.

If you know the truth and the other does not know, you are certainly
superior to the other. But, if you really know the absolute truth, you
do not feel superior.
