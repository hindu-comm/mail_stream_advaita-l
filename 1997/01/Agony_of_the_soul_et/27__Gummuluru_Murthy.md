posting.

Again, in my view,

3. There is no liberation. I would like to question: Liberation from what?

Again, in my view,
As long as avidya exists (in the individual), jIva thinks that it is
                                                   ^^^^^^
                                                   ^^^^^^
reborn and continues to be reborn. The emphasis should be on "think". In
reality, there is nothing reborn and that is the paramartha level which
we should be understanding, not the avidya-based jIva is born and reborn
concept.

it thinks it continues to be reborn.
   ^^^^^^
There is an ocean of difference between the two statements.

I had difficulty all along why this particular concept is emphasized when
it is known it is not true.

Yes.

Again, aren't Ishwara and karma-phala concepts based on avidyA ? Why this
avidyaic interpretation ?

Certainly we do not go to Aristotlian concepts in physics after we come
to know Einsteinian physics.

I realize my original question is faulty in that the individual is not
performing any action to derive the fruits of action.

I would be grateful for any clarifications.
