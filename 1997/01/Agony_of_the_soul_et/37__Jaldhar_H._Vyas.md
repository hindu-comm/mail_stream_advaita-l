Fine _in_the_end_ but the problem is most of these mystic types have never
bothered to begin exercising their mind and intellect.  So it is rather
silly of them to be saying anything about the usefulness of intellect.

All people are intellectual people.  Some may be too lazy to use theirs
but it doesn't mean they are not capable.

Then there those scholars who combine great learning with saintliness.
Though I do not claim to be one of them, I also do not let my respect for
the powers of the intellect stop me from trying  to live the Dharmic life.
Indeed even though I wasn't born in India and haven't had the access to
our tradition my cousins have, I can rightfully say I'm the equal of any
of them.  Does this strike you as being a prideful statement?  It is.  But
it is also the truth.  Why shouldn't I be proud of the truth?  It's the
same with the acharyas you speak of.  They know the truth.  The truth is
the ignorant will never achieve moksha no matter how saintly, humble, or
good they may be.  pride is a far, far smaller sin than ignorance and
pride in the truth is no sin at all.

In another context a poet said "it is better to have loved and lost than
never to have loved at all."  The journey out of Maya is perilous and many
who undertake it will fail.  In the Gita Arjuna asked given the difficulty
of taking on the Kauravas and the sins involved isn't it better to forget
it all and live the humble, unaffected, natural life elsewhere?  Krishna
Bhagavan responds with a resounding NO!  One has to meet the challenge
head on, no matter what.  And if one is not ready for it then fine.
Nobody says you have to be a mumukshu.  The shastras prescribe other paths
for those people.  In fact if you want to criticize anyone for pride it
should be the ones who think they can practice Vedantic sadhana when they
are obviously not ready for it.

Even for those who fall from the Vedantic path, it is only a
temporary setback.  The shastras say they will be reborn in a better
position (in swarga etc.) where they can continue their sadhana perhaps
more successfully.  We should not let our disappointments and fear of
failure prevent us from following the truth.
