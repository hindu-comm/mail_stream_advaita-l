We are not talking about the experience but the description of the
experience.  If it isn't possible to describe what meditaion is we will
never know with certainty whether we are experiencing it or not.

Right, so experience is sufficient in the case of sleep because sleep is
universal.  If it weren't than experience would be not be adequate proof.
Meditation is not a universal experience so additional proof is needed.

Aha! so meditaion can be described.  This was the entire point of
contention.  I should point out I didn't require anything beyond my
intellect to understand your definition.  I certainly didn't require any
experience.

Remember Vedanta following Purva Mimamsa also accepts abhava or negative
inference as a pramana.  We can understand Brahman by understanding all
the things which are not Brahman.  This enables us to make statements
about Brahman (that it is Satya etc.)

Bhakti involves attachment to the saguna Brahman and throughout his works
Shankaracharya teaches that this is ultimately illusionary too.

The shastras are valid because they are based on the Vedas.  Indeed the
measure of a shastra is the degree to which it is in concordance with the
Vedas.  So the question is reduced to what makes the Vedas valid?  This is
a topic which the Purva Mimamsakas have considered at length (in a
rational manner I might add.) They base the validity of the Vedas on it
being nitya (eternal, unchanging) and apaurusheya (unauthored by any being
mortal or divine.)

The very multiplicity of interpretations you note proves that the Vedas
have not been tampered with.  Given the raging controversy between the
various darshans, wouldn't it have been tempting to just excise any parts
which didn't agree with the trend of the day?  There is no evidence anyone
ever did this because loyalty to the Vedas outweighs loyalty to any
ideology.   The Vedas aren't important because they teach Advaita.
Advaita is important because it is taught by the Vedas.

You are entitled to your view, you are not entitled to call it Vedanta.

I demand the same proof as for any other subject in the world.  Logic is
a reliable means for determining the truth.  I don't believe you or anyone
else actually believes for a minute that logic will prove false overnight.
