This is a good definition of the Yoga Darshana (chitavrittinirodhah) but
it is _not_ a good definition of Vedanta of any school let alone Advaita.
The objective of a Vedantin is to know Brahman and the word used (jignasa)
denotes an intellectual enquiry.

So there is a bheda amongst Advaiins?  Shankaracharya differs from us only
in degree not kind.  His mission is the same as ours.  Engaging indebate
is a duty only of Brahmans as their duty is to teach the Vedas but
understanding is the duty of us all.

The focus is not on the other person but on yourself.  If someone is
raising questions about your supposed beliefs and you cannot answer them
you should be alarmed and anxious to rectify the situation.  Ignorance is
not bliss.

This is something I've always found fascinating about the so-called
neo-vedantins (i.e. Vivekananda, Chinmayananda etc.)  Apparently in their
philosophy one just stumbles through life waiting for some vague,
undefined thing to magically happen.  This is supposedly the path to peace
but I don't see how any kind of peace could result from something so
unstable.

The copy of the Shiva Mahapurana I have was given to me by a lady at our
mandir who is not at all literate in Sanskrit.  But she believed that by
the very act of purchasing such a book and giving it as dana to a Brahmana
she would earn punya.  How much more punya could you gain by reading and
understanding the Shastras?  Swami Madhusudana Saraswati was a giant in
the Advaita parampara.  Indeed without his efforts there might possibly be
no Advaita today.  By reading his works and those of other great acharyas,
we strengthen our our sadhana and purify it from doubt and delusion.

So you will never know whether your mind is tuned or not.  Read the
shastras and you won't be mystified any longer.

Rather, when the emotions vanish, you recognize what you are.

Certainly not.  But being a grihastha is the source of sukha and dukha.
Only Sannyasa will cure that.
