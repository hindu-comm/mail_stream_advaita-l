Again, I repeat the focus is not on the other person but on ones self.
Even if you don't feel the need to give an answer you should know the
answer.  How else can you be sure you are heading along the right path?
"It feels right" is not an adequate answer.  Many people practice the
"sadhana" of getting drunk or taking drugs which also produces feelings of
oneness and peace.  Until you wake up a few hours that is.  Permanent
mental stability can only be acheived by discipline of the mind.

On what basis is the study of Vedanta different from the study of
chemistry or physics?
