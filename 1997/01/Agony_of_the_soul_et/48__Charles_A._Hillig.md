     I think that the Guru-devotee relationship is important until the
devotee realizes that, all along, he's only been talking to himself.

     The final "goal" is realization and lovingly seeing things with an
equal eye seems to go along with it.

     I think that, using your example, the free bird has to first discover
that it is free.  Seeking fruit gives it "something to do" while it's
discovering that it's free.

     It is inscrutable.

     It wants to fool Itself.  Its nature is to be what it is..... by
pretending to become what it isn't.  It can't be what it isn't, of course,
but It can have a lot of fun pretending that it can!

     Yes, that's IT!
