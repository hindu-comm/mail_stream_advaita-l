I will not be presumptuous to say that our mission is the same as that of
Bhagavan Shankaracarya. Such a thought would not even enter into the mind.

I am at peace with my thinking. I do not feel rattled if a person finds
another approach preferrable. If the other person asks me with a genuine
interest in learning, I can try to explain and myself learn something in
the process. If the motive is not learning but something else, it is not
for me to enter into a debate.

Shri Sadananda's response in this thread is to the point.

I feel my comment "Reading technical treatises on advaita or dvaita and
parroting the views does not make any difference" is twisted to give the
impression that I said reading treatises have no meaning. Far from it. It
is only through the grace of great acaryas and their writings that we are
learning something. I read advaita commentaries very regularly and have
the utmost reverence towards them.

My emphasis is that parroting the treatises does not make any difference,
unless the mind is ready to accept what is in it. This is not like reading
physics or chemistry and solving problems at the end of the chapter. The
mind has to be ready to accept what is in the treatises.
