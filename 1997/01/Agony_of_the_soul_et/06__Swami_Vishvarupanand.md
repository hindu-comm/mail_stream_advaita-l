We become what we think, whether in love or in hate.
Therefore one argument is, that by becoming Vishnu's enemies
and developing an all consuming hatred towards Him, Jaya and Vijaya
actually became obsessed by the thought of Him. Our mind is usually less
continually and less intensely occupied with the object of its love and
adoration, than with the object of obsessive hatred. In Hiranyakashipu's
case his son Prahalada brought this hatred to its boiling point, so that
the demon was not able to think of anything but Vishnu with an intensity
that would have been very difficult to attain for Jaya or Vijaya as
devotees. Prahalada had this intensity as a devotee.

Greetings and Om,
