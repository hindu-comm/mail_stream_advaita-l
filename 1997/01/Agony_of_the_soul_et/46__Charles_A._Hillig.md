     I don't think that we "have" to "do" anything simply because we really
can't.
Why?  Because there is no separate  "do-er" here who is "doing-the-doing."
In short,  you have no real choice about practicing or not practicing.  At
best, you can only say that you have the choice between attaching yourself
to the practicing or not.    If you "choose" to practice, you'll discover
soon enough if it is appropriate for you.   Free will is as illusory as the
one who is supposed to be having it.

    But, either way, it's really OK.  As Buddha once said "At the end of the
road is freedom.   Untill then, patience.".

     Actually, I think the very terror that it triggers can help to jar us
into realization.  Sometime the way out of hell, is to go further on into it.
