Namaste,
I am new to this list so let me give a short introduction of myself. My
name is Swami Vishvarupananda. I am a Shri Vidya Upasaka with a fascination
for Kashmir Shaivaism. I chanced on a log of your group which I found quite
interesting, so I subscribed then and there.
With best wishes for a great start in 1997,
