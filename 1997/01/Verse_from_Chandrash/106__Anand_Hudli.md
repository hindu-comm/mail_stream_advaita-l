We have a soma-pradoshha today, extending from sunset to about
2 1/2 hours thereafter. This period is sacred for the worship
of Shiva.

The second verse from Chandrashekhara-ashhTaka. There is a story
about MaarkaNDeya who was destined to die at the age of sixteen. When
the appointed time approached, his parents became very sad. But the boy
assured his parents that he would overcome Death by worshipping Shiva.
He went to the temple and became absorbed in the worship of the Shiva
linga. Yama (Death) sent his messengers to fetch the boy's life. But
they were unable to approach the sanctum sanctorum of the temple where
the boy was engaged worshipping Shiva. Seeing the inability of the
messengers in taking away MaarkaNDeya's life, Yama himself came to
do the job. But Shiva appeared from the linga and kicked Yama on the
chest. MaarkaNDeya thus conquered Death and became a chiranjiivin.

 mama kiM karishhyati vai yamaH - what will Yama (Death) do to me?


 The two lotus feet of Lord Shiva, bearing the fragrance of the flowers
 from the five kinds of trees (which are used to worship them),
 enhance the brilliance of Him. His (third) eye, situated in His
 forehead, burned up the body of Kaama, the god of Love. The body of
 the imperishable Bhava, who destroys futher births, is smeared by
 ashes. I seek refuge in that Chandrashekhara (the Lord who bears the
 moon on his head). What will Death do to me?
