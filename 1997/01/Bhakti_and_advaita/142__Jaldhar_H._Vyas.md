Actually if you go back and read what I said, bhakti is _much_better_ than
attachment to booze.  Precisely because in its purest form it can lead to
krama mukti.  And krama mukti means rebirth in brahmaloka where the jiva
can achieve jnana which is what I said.   I challenge you to find one
place in Shankaracharyas writings where he even entertains the idea that
there can be moksha without jnana.  You won't find any such theory in
Swami Madhusudan Saraswatis writings either.

I don't know Ramana, I don't know which Jagadguru endorsed or didn't
endorse his views.  All I have to go by is the quality of his
self-professed disciples which is in general rather low.

Well if you redefine bhakti as jnana than the whole problem vanishes.
However the conventional definition of bhakti, what the average man in the
street would understand by the term is loving service to a God who is
seperate from the worshipper.  That is a kind of attachment which is an
obstacle to moksha and can only lead to the krama mukti mentioned above.
