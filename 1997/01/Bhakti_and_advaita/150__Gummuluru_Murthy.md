Swarga, Brahmaloka, the world all are as real or as unreal as we would
like to see them to be. In my opinion, swarga and naraka are creations of
the mind. Surely, there are descriptions in the ithihaasaas. But the
feelings of swarga and naraka are all only in this world and are as real
as this world and are as unreal as this world.

Shiva and Vishnu are as real as you or I. I agree with that.

I am not denying the substratum. We need a substratum for everything: you,
I, the world, the swarga, the naraka and all. I do not think I have said
anywhere that I deny the substratum.

What is the cycle of re-births ? Is that not the notion of the jeeva in
its ajnanic thinking ?

Shri Shankara said that Brahmaloka can be attained and we be free from
cycle of re-births if we do good things (e.g. follow Saguna Brahman). But,
in my view, Shri Shankara said that only to make us (ajnanis) do good
things and look beyond the maaya. Following Saguna Brahman (with powers)
is an easy first step for a mumukshu who is under the influence of maaya
(both for the teacher to teach and the disciple to grasp).

It is our ajnana which makes us think that we participate in the cycle of
births and re-births. But surely, there are no birth, death, or re-birth
for the Ultimate which we are. We are not freed from the cycle of
re-births. We are always free. It is our mind which is to be freed from
the notion of birth and re-births. That freedom from "re-births" can be
obtained from jnanam.

Vedic rites is a topic which is monumental by itself.

Worship is not the important thing here. The mental frame-up is the
important one.
