Providing jnana is achieved.  And while this is more likely in Brahmaloka
and their is much less chance of falling from such an exalted position it
is by no means a foregone conclusion that moksha will be achieved.

It is not just attachment to the senses but attachment to any kind of maya
which prevents mukti.  And Ishwar in the final analysis is on the level of
maya.
