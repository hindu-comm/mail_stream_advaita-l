O Devi! You are the intelligence by which the essence of all scriptures
is known. You are Goddess Durga, the boat by which we may cross the
difficult ocean of illusory existence. You are Goddess Lakshmi who alone
resides in the heart of Vishnu. You are Gauri (Parvati) who has
established Herself as the spouse of Shiva.
