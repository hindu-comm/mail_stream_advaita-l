        So well written that it is worth repeating. However, i think, this
jiiva-Ishvara aikya also applies between two jiiva-s in the vyavaharika
satya. For example, i have certain qualifications and job, while my friend
is illiterate and cannot do my job. Thus, though on a body-mind level, we
are acting different roles (donning different veshas), we are not
different since the essential nature of us is Brahman.
        So long as we associate each other with names and forms, and think
that the jivas are different from Atman, we are different. This difference
is unreal since in essence (when the upaadhis are removed) we are all the
same.

Namaste.
