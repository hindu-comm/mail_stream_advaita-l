Usually in such arguments the motives start with (b) and end with
(c) mentioned above both of which are not very useful to either
party or the persons following the discussions.

Discussions within the group and informative postings are more
useful.

Another objective of philosophy of any kind is the urge to know the
ultimate cause of one's own existence and that of creation. This
can also be mapped to a quest for peace of mind because by knowing
one gets some satisfaction.

This explanation will not be recognised by dvaitins because they treat truth
as a framework having an objective existence into which other entities like
Brahman, Jiva, Jada etc. fit into.

According to them one may accept, reject or be ignorant of the
truth but the truth itself remains.

Because of this their world view sounds more like a story.

Many stories start off as "Once upon a time there was a king ...".

In dvaita philosophy the story is something like:

"There always has been and there always will be a Narayana & there
always were and there always will be innumerable jivas. Narayana
has such and such qualities and the jivas have such and such
qualities. The jivas very subordinate to narayana are expected to
behave in such and such way failing which they will find themselves
in bondage and so on ...".

Only thing this story has been covered by an extensive logical
framework and presented as a philosophy.

Another thing to be noted in the dvaita story is that Narayana is
supreme only to the extent the story permits him to be. He for
instance cannot extinguish a jiva because each jiva is independent
and eternal. He is labeled with various attributes to which he must
stick on. So he is a mere actor in the leela and not the author of
the leela. The leela is given by the truth as expounded by the
dvaita story which is eternal ( which is why the eternity of vedas
is so important in dvaita philosophy since it bases itself on
vedas? ).

But in advaita there is no truth apart from and independent of the
knower of the truth. The truth is beyond knowledge and ignorance.
So it can afford to accept dvaita as a viewpoint which when refined
further will lead to the non-dual enternal Brahman.
