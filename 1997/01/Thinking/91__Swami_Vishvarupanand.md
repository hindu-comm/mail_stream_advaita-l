Yes, very true. And it is that natural state that leads beyond the bounds
of the intellect and mind and in which direct perception happens, and it is
from here that one proceeds to the state where subject, object and
perception are one, where Brahman is realised by _being_ THAT.
What you say is an important aspect that needs to be mentioned in
connection with going beyond mind.

Greetings and Om,
Swami Vishvarupananda
