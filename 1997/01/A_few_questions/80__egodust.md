Excellent dissertation on the vaadas.

Regarding the vyavaharikic advent of Isvara's maya, I tend to be in the
advaitic minority and side more with the drishti-srishti vaada.  Yet it seems
to me that, in a more comprehensive sense, it's a simultaneous occurrence: the
observer and the observed are *at once* a production of Mind-stuff, and to
theorize which function thereof manifests first is like falling prey to a
double deception, as if the first (leela) wasn't enough!  Yet, as you know,
these are merely devices to temporarily appease the jiva if/when apparently
trapped in [his/her] world dilemma.

Namaste.
