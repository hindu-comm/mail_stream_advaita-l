There is a story about Abhinavagupta and Shankaracharya (who were
contemporaries) told by Swami Ananda Giri that the two got into some
argument and Abhinavagupta cursed Shankaracharya with some nasty disease.
Padmapadacharya was able to turn back the curse and Abhinavagupta died
from it.  Does anyone know what the circumstances of the disagreement
were? Advaita is based on the Tantras wheareas Kashmir Shaivism is based
on the Shaivagamas but other than that how compatible or incompatible are
they?
