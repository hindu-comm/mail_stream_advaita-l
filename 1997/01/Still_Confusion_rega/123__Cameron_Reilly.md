Inferior? Are you saying that advaita recognises one 'mental concept' to be
of a higher order than another 'mental concept'?

Certainly the word 'advaita' itself means 'non-duality', does it not? Not
two.

This inability to see beyond the pairs of opposites is due to a fixation
with dualism. The 'one-ness' of things must first be apperceived before the
words of the Masters will become clear.
