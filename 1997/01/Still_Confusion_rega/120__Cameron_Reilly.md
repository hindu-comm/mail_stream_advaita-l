I disagree. In advaita, the pot neither IS devoid of objective reality, nor
is it NOT devoid of objective reality. Both are merely matters of
perspective. Seen from the perspective of the Absolute, the pot does not
exist as an object. It is one with Brahman. Seen from the perspective of
the subjective split-mind, the pot certainly does exist, as does the head
which you hit it against. Both perspectives are absolutely correct, if
understood as flip sides to the coin of the Infinite.

Again I disagree. Bhakti can certainly result in moksha. True Bhakti
results in the assimilation of the ego into the absolute. "Thy will Lord,
not mine."

And ego-less functioning is exactly the result of jnana, just come at from
a different path.

Ego-less functioning will in itself result in the dissolution of the
individual into the Absolute.
