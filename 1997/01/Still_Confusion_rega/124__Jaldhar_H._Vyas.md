Certainly.  A pot is far more real than a three sided square isn't it?

A basic misunderstanding people seem to have is the idea that in Advaita
the world is not real.  Actually we say it is real but misunderstood.

It is the jiva and Brahman which are not two.  I  don't see why what we're
talking about should affect that in any way.

The words of the masters are clear.  The problem is a lot of people don't
bother to read them.

The difference between the two is that Shankaracharya has left a
systematic body of work and a parampara.  So if you do make some claim of
representing his thought there is an objective standard to measure your
claim against.  Apparently, judging by my experience on the internet, any
nut with a vaguely mystical notion can call himself a disciple of Ramana.
If you feel such people are bringing a person you respect into disrepute
it behooves the more learned disciples to correct their errant brethren.

I must admit that I don't. When I decided to mention the possibility of a
fall I was thinking of the Puranas specifically the story of Jaya and
Vijaya the dwarapals of Vaikuntha in the Bhagawata Purana.  Of course the
Puranas being based on the Vedas are more authoritative that the Agamas
Shaiva Siddhanta is based on but the rule is if there is a discrepancy
between Shruti and Smriti, Shruti overrides.  So based on the examples you
gave it would seem that a fall would not be possible.  Or perhaps there is
some other way to resolve the seeming discrepancy.
