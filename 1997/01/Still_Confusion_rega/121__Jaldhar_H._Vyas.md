May I point out the  word objective means not depending on a matter of
perspective.

But I don't think you're actually disagreeing with me.  Read on.

This is what I said in my reply to Dennis.  These are the two kinds of
consciousness.  And in at least one of them, the pot is real.

The question is does the higher form of consciousness replace the other or
are the two simultaneous?  My understanding (admittedly not complete here)
is that the latter is true.  After moksha maya doesn't stop, it just
ceases to be an obstacle.

Nope sorry.  bhakti will do no such thing.  Because as far as Advaita is
concerned the Lord (Ishwar) is only the saguna or lower aspect of Brahman.
And attachment to God though much better than attachment to  booze or
money is still attachment to maya and thus an obstacle to moksha.

I heard this person was a tobacconist.  Is that true?
