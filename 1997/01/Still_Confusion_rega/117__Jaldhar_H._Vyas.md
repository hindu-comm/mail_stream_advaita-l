What on earth does any saying of the Buddha have to do with Vedanta?
And from whence to do you pot is the entire universe?

First of all as you made clear this is a Buddhist view not a Vedantic one,
certainly not an Advaita one.  In Advaita the pot is *not* devoid of
objective reality.  Hit yourself over the head with a pot and see if it
disappears or not.  Maybe after you do that your perceptions will
metamorph into whiteout but whiteout is not the Advaita conception of
Brahman.

It does not seem to exist.  It does exist.

I would hope your mind would refuse to stay settled in your heart.  I
don't think the average rib cage is big enough to fit a mind and a heart.

Or did you mean something else?  A little clarity in your thoughts
wouldn't be a bad thing you know.

Ahmamkara is hardly the source of all thoughts.  If this were so anyone
who managed to transcend the edo would be a vegetable.

This view may be acceptable to some of the other schools of Vedanta but as
far as Advaita is concerned jnana and jnana alone can be the path to
moksha.  The best we can hope to achieve from bhakti is rebirth in a world
where jnana will be easier to achieve.
