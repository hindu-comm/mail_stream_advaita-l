Now you are creating duality.  You're saying there is something other than
Brahman.  The only things that can be like that are things like the
three-sided square that logically cannot exist at all.  Anything that
exists is real to some degree but the extent to which it is real is hidden
by maya.

If the world was only a concept in your mind than the first time anyone
achieved moksha the world would cease to exist.  This is patently
ridiculous.  The world cannot be simply wished away.
