Constructed by whom?

So your answer to the question above is each jiva is responsible for
constructing its own reality.

The question of what is "Cameron" is more complicated because a human
being is an aggregate of things so we will start with a simple thing like
a pot.  Once we've worked out its status we can extrapolate up to you.

Now if we showed a pot to various people and one saw it as a pot, and one
as a plate and another as a cat, you're view would have some merit.
However if we actually do this we'll see that I will see it as a pot, you
will, see it as a pot and every other person we show it to will see it as
a pot.  (Leaving aside those whose perception is defective such as the
blind and insane.)  Now the name the pot is known by may be different.
The Gujarati may call it "ghado", the Australian may call it "pot" but
this is just a matter of custom.  For a human being its more complicated
because more of a humans qualities are customary but there is still an
essential Cameron that we can know and use to seperate you from the false
Camerons.  (Through a method called DNA testing.  Ask your local police
station for details.)

It goes without saying this is only at the vyavaharic level but that
is the only level at which such the self-enquiry you are suggesting can
take place.
