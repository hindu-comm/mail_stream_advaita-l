How different is it ? While dreaming, did you know that 'actually there is one
Mr. so and so who is sleeping, and whatever happening now is a dream'? You
thought everyting was real then.
Same is the case with waking state. It is yet another dream.

Your wish is in dream, my going away or sticking to the list is your dream.
Sometimes I wish in my dreams that the demons should go away.
But the poor fellows don't. Anyway, when I wake up they are gone.
So wake up, and I will be gone.

People in dreams do respond. They will come and tell you that they are real.
They do assure their existence through actions.
Only when I wake up from the dream, it is all over.

Appearances in dream have no outside independent existence, but for in the
 dream.
So is the world.
