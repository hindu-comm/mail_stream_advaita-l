No, I disagree. The pot and the three sided square have equal reality -
both are nothing more than concepts in your mind. Advaita does NOT say the
world is real at all. Advaita sayd the world is a mental concept. What is
real is the Brahman. Everything else is sensory illusion.

I think people DO read them but rarely investigate for themselves and thus
get trapped in trying to understand words - which again are concepts. And
the truth will never be found in concepts.
