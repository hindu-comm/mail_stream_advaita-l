This is the beginning of Bhakti.

This looks paradoxical. You say that the pot has an essential
existence, and then you deny its appearance immediately. Now I am
confused, what 'essential existence' are you talking about ?
The existence that cannot be verified due to the Maya obstruction,
or the existence that has been verified ? If the former, then the
the idea of pot itself is illusory, and hence the pot as it is
known now is non-existent, and hence talking about its essential
existence becomes absurd. But if the latter, then you are saying
that there is nothing like Maya. And hence talking about Maya becomes
absurd.

That's convenient.
In many other cases too.
