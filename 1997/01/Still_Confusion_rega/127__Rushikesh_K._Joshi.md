Can you say that the world that appears in your dream cannot be
wished away ?

It is just in your dream that people have obtained Moksha.
And hence it is pointless to search whether after a person gets Moksha
or Jnana, the world will still remain. "People got Jnana" is a dream in
your mind. It should not be taken much seriously.
Once these kinds of dreams are over, will there be any world left ?
Will there be the world, of the people in the dream, still exisiting ?
