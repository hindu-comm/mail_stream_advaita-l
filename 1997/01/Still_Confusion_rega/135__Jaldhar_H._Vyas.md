The question is irrelevant.  We are talking about what is purported to be
the dream of the observer and we know exactly who the dreamer is.  This is
the point the previous poster was missing.  A dream is the product of pure
ego.  Ones dreams are ones own and cannot be shared.  The world on the
other hand is shared amongst all observers and doesn't depend on any of
them.

If on the other hand you are saying the world depends on Brahman there is
no argument.  In fact everyone on this list probably agrees with that.
What I'm trying to show is the absurdity of saying the world depends on
the jiva.  The best you can do is make an analogy "the waking state is to
jnana as the dream state is to the waking state."  This in no way implies
that the waking and dream states are equal.
