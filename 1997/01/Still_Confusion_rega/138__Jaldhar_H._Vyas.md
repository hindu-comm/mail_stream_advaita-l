Please clarify.  What is the beginning of Bhakti, radical idealism,
illusion or absurdity?

Brahman is the pots essential existence.  The appearence which I deny is
maya.

Your argument is predicated upon the idea that Brahman cannot be
recognized.  It is covered or veiled by maya yes, but not so completely
that it is impossible for us to ever pierce the veil.  We can always know
the essential nature of a thing because we know that the essential nature
is Brahman and Brahman is self-illuminating.  If this were not so Moksha
would be impossible as we would never be able to know Brahman.  (You
cannot wriggle out of this by saying "we were always Brahman"  because the
natural state of the jiva is delusion and it doesn't know this yet.)  Maya
does not become irrelevant because it explains why the deluded observers
observe the same things.
