Absolutely correct? And as flip sides to the Infinite? That is more like
bheda-abheda or dvaita-advaita than like advaita. There have been
philosophers who take such a position, namely Bhaskara and Nimbarka. What
differentiates advaita from this position is that the second view is held
to be inferior to the first, and not as equivalently valid.
