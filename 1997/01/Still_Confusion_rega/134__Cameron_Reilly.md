Jaldhar, 'who' is the witness of Observer A, Observer B and the pot?

Remember, the perceiver cannot be the perceived.

Observer A, Observer B and the pot are all merely mental
constructs.Sometime our thinking, Jaldhar, is truncated by ego-centredness.
Because we believe our self to be 'real' we see the universe through this
paradigm.

We must first use self enquiry to apperceive that what we think 'we' are
really has no objective existence outside the mind.
