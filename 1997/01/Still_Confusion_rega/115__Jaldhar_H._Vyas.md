Think of looking at the pot in a mirror.  As long as the mirror is perfect
you are seeing the pot as it is.  If it is distorted like one of those fun
house mirrors that make you look fatter or thinner, what you see as the
pot is different from what the pot actually is.  But it is possible if
you know the distorting properties of the mirror for you to know the true
nature of the pot even if you only see the reflection.  The mirror in
this case is Maya which distorts the true natures of things.  Thus the two
kinds of consciousness, that of a thing as it appears and that as it is.
Everyone has the first kind but the second kind needs to be developed.
