Read what I wrote my friend. Did I say there was something other than
Brahman? I said everything else is 'illusion'.

Guess what? When moksha is reached, the phenomenal world DOES cease to
exist! To the person of understanding, the phenomenal world merges with the
Brahman. There is no separation. It is not 'wished' away, it is simply not
seen as being objectively 'real'. The phenomenal manifestation is known to
be merely the reflection of Brahman in the mind.

I quote from Ramesh Balsekar:

"To the ignorant individual, whatever is seen by the senses appears real
and is taken as real - and only that which is perceived through the senses
is real. To the sage, on the other hand, whatever appears is not real:
whatever appears is only the changeable appearance of the unperceived Real.
In other words, the ego-centric, identified individual, fully awake to the
world of perception, is asleep to the real, the Atman, lived and enjoyed by
the sage."

(Ramesh S. Balsekar "The Bhagavad Gita"
Zen Publications, 1996)
