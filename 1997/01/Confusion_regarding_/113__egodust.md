If I may comment on this...

If we have a clear grasp of Sankara's triadic [advaita] formula, we would
see that what He set out to do was provide a means whereby we can effectively
diffuse the vasanas (latent obsessive-compulsive thought relationings based
on the attitude of the self/not-self world-view) within the Mind.  It's only
a method to this end, and not an end in itself.  That is, to settle upon the
activity of defining things, events and egos, as illusory, is a means to
re-condition the Mind's insistence to conceive/perceive notions of such
phenomena as *things in themselves*, being mutually exclusive of Brahman.
This is why His 3rd axiom states that the jiva is not-different from
Brahman.  Yet, we're told that this axiom doesn't represent the words of
Sankara, but was formulated posthumously.  It seems more technically correct
to say the triple aspect of prakrit (the sohamidam: saguna aspect of God,
jiva and world) and not merely the jiva aspect of prakrit, is what is
non-different from Brahman.  That maya is a result of considering a thing
as real *unto itself*, otherwise it is quite real, being Brahman Itself.

So the "two perceptions" are a strategy and not a sanctioned duality.
If this were better understood, there wouldn't be such heated protest of
the so-called mayavadin philosophy attributed to Sankara.  It would be
better to refer to it as sathyavadin philosophy!  Reality is omnipresent
except when notions of isolationism are superimposed on it.

Namaste.
