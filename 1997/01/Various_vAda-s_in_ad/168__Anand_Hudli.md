  I have only an introductory understanding of Kashmir Shaivism, so
  my comments below are to be understood with that in mind.

  A reading of the maanasollaasa shows that the author accepts that
  kriyaa (activity) is in Brahman. From what little I know of Kashmir
  Shaivism, kriyaa is said to be in Shiva (Brahman). But this is not
  the position of advaita according to which Brahman is nishhkriya,
  actionless. In fact, Shankara goes to great lengths to deny _any_
  semblance of activity in Brahman in his major works. So on this point
  alone, one could argue that the author of maanasollaasa was not
  Sureshvara or if he was, he probably wrote it under the influence of
  Kashmir Shaivism.

  Again, this point of Brahman being nishhkriya in advaita vis a vis
  Brahman being with activity in Kashmir Shaivism distinguishes the
  maanasollaasa from GauDapaada kaarikas, where we do not find activity
  attributed to Brahman.


  I am not suggesting that Kashmir Shaivism is completely different from
  advaita. I think they have a lot more in common than a few differences.
