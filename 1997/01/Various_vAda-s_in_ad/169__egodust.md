Bravo!

Yes.  I agree that the drishti-srishti vaada seems to make the most sense
from the vyavahrika level.  It's more plausible due to the immediacy factor
unique to the creative process of the Mind, where what it instantaneously
conceives it consequently witnesses in the form of [its very own nature,
being the sensibly] 'objective adjuncts.'  It seems important that from
the vyavahara perspective the more consistently logical the paradigm [to
explain the workings of prakrit], the better; regardless of whether or not
such paradigm is arbitrary or even false.  It's needed as fire fighting fire
to diffuse the powerful world-hungry Mind.

However, if within the vaadas given in the maanasollasa vaartika--as
Anand points out--, the supporting idea is that Brahman is active, puts
a confusing spin on the vaada, and technically shouldn't be referred to as
drishti-shrishti, IMO.  This is also the big reservation I have regarding
Kashmir Shaivism.  *However*, I think it's almost as misleading to conclude
that Brahman is nishkriya!  In this regard, I think in Sankara's emphasizing
this point, He was strictly addressing entry-level vyavaharikas; whereas
the more advanced would be ready to understand that *any* affirmative
or negative characteristic applied to Brahman is grossly misleading,
including Satchidananda Itself!  As it has been explained, the *only*
indirectly [deductively determined] upadhis associated with Brahman can
only be communicated in the double negative: that It is not without Sat,
not without Chit, and not without Ananda.  To speak of it as being active
or not, willful or not, or even compassionate or not, is to deliver It
back into the sphere of relative limitation.  If this is not in fact what
Sankara had in mind, I would entreat Him to reconsider!  (Regardless,
from the paramarthika level, it's all academic anyway.  I just think it'd
be more effective to approach the final threshold with the least trace of
ideological sophistication possible.)

BTW, where can I get a copy of the book: "jagatguru pathilaLikkirAr"?


Namaskaar.
