As pointed out by Anand, Manasollasa has terminology that is not typically
Vedantic and that has led critical scholars to doubt it is a genuine work
of Sureshwaracharya.  Of course this is not a problem for us in the
Advaita parampara who do not see why there must be a conflict between
Vedanta and Tantra (at least of the Shrividya sort.  Kashmir shaivism is
another matter.)  Think of tantra as a practice-oriented simplification of
Vedanta.  One has to beware of over-simplication however as this can lead
to non-vedic conclusions.

If as you seem to be suggesting below drshtisrshtivada simply considers
questions of jati as irrelevant than it is not a very stable foundation
for expressing ajativada.

In light of the confusion of some members of the list this cannot be
stressed enough.  The truth depends on both Shruti and Reason.
Intellectualism not based on the shastras is mere sophistry.  Repeating
the words of the shastras without a logical understanding of them is
nothing but gibberish.

I disagree that drshtisrshtivada has either of these defects though for
reasons I will explain in another post.

For moksha one must have the unassailable conviction that there is no
difference between ones self and Brahman and what seems to be reality is
in fact Maya.  In order to achieve this one must have viveka.  One must be
able to distinguish between what is eternal and unchanging and what is
transitory and subject to creation and destruction.  This is why it is
important to understand the theories of creation described in the shastras.
Otherwise if one depends on vague feelings one can easily get trapped in
delusion.

Not necessarily.  An explanation of why I think so will be forthcoming.

Note the interesting thing about this excerpt is what Abhinava Vidyatirtha
Maharaj doesn't say.  Although he says both the waking and dream states
are unreal (which no Advaitin would dispute) he doesn't say the dream
state and the waking state are the same.  And while he says it a waste of
time to wonder if other jivas exist he doesn't unequivocally come out for
the ekajivavada.  (You have to bear in mind this is from a talk for the
general public and he probably would explain his views more rigorously in
an academic situation.)
