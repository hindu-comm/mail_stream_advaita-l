They aren't paying either Advaita or Buddhism much of a compliment when
they say that.

No. Buddhists say there _isn't_ a reality behind everything.  Vedantins
say there is.  You cannot treat these two as equivalents.  They are in
fact polar opposites.

A salient feature of Buddhist thought is the doctrine of momentariness.
Nothing is eternal.  Buddhists therefore refer to realization as Nirvana or
'existance' wherease Vedantins refer to it as Moksha or 'release'.

Buddhists believe atma = ahamkara and is unreal.  Vedantins believe the
atma is real.  (The different schools disagree on whether this atma is
identical to Brahman)

Finally, Buddhists reject the validity of the Vedas and ancillary shastras
as a valid means of knowledge whereas _all_ Vedantins (not just Dvaitins
as you erroneously stated in your previous post) believe Shruti, Smrti,
and Shistachara are the _only_ valid means to knowledge of Brahman.

That's like saying humans and fish are the same though they differ in arms
and legs.

Advaitins are familiar with Buddhist philosophy because the great Acharyas
of our parampara have vehemently criticized it.  It is obvious from
Shankaracharyas writings that he regards Buddhism as the worst kind of
heresy and nothing to do with Vedanta.
