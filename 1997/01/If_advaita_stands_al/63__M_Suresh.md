I know  that according to  you these  people are not  Brahma Jnani's
because they were not experts in shastras.

The question of  "who is a jnani"  came up in this  mailing list and
the conclusion seemed to  be that there is no hard  and fast rule to
prove someone to be or not to be a jnani.

But I hope that shastric knowledge is not a necessary and sufficient
condition for jnana  according to you.  In that case we will have to
have  examinations   in  shastras   followed  by  handing   over  of
certificates to successful people saying that they are jnani's :-).

My point  in giving these  examples was  that however  great the
vedic philosophy may be the ultimate truth  cannot be locked up with
shastras  as  the only  key.  It  must  be something  universal  and
accesible and applicable to all.  Otherwise it does not make sense.

The goal  is one's essential  nature.  Hence it is not be  learnt as
something new to be acquired.  All practice and study of shastras is
only to remove the bonds of mAya due to ignorance and reveal what one
already is.

I gave the reasons  as to why I think so.  I do not have anything to
add to that.
