So what if it does?  That they are not knowers of Brahman doesn't imply
they were bad or irrelevant people.

Mirabai was a vaishnava and would be rather offended to learn she had

Devotion, meditation etc. are all goal oriented.  You cannot achieve a

the two and as they are opposites, you cannot do this.
