Of course Brahman can be known and experienced.  Even in Advaita.  It is
known through the Vedas which assign it qualities such as satya.  It is
experienced in the state of Samadhi.  You seem to think that any kind of
description is evidence of duality.  If that were so then you would be
correct that Brahman is unknowable and thus for practical purposes
non-existent.  However one can affirm the astitva of brahman for instance
without causing any duality.  Phrases of Shruti though ultimately
illusionary themselves can give indirect indication which point the way to
positive descriptions of Brahman.  This also does not involve any kind of
bheda.

I should clarify that the shastras are the only valid means of knowledge of
Brahman not knowledge in general.  I'm in favor of giving a prominent place
to the pramana of Inference but the presence of Brahman cannot be inferred
independently as it is not not something that can be apprehended by the
senses.

Equivalence of a part does not mean equivalence of the whole.  This is
basic logic.
