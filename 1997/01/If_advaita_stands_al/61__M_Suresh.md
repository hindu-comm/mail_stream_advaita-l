As I said earlier  ( also in my response to Anand  Hudli on the same
subject) Brahman  is beyond  knowledge,  experience and description.
So it can be considered non-existent.

I believe  all descriptions  of Brahman would  really only  apply to
Ishwara who falls in the realm of duality.

Thus if  Ishwara were considered  to be a Vyaavahaarika  Sathya then
possibly  the  word Brahman  may  be  a  better description  of  the
ultimate truth  rather than emptiness.  But still both point  to the
same truth which transcends all duality.

I do not think  I will have anything more to  add on the equivalence
of Buddhist emptiness and advaitic Brahman.

In that case the realization  of Brahman by persons like Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharishi, Mirabai etc., will have to be denied.

Also access to Brahma vidya will have to be restricted to persons of
a geographical region.  Persons like Jesus christ will be out.

Also Brahma  vidya would have been  unknown in the pre-vedic  era if
the eternity of vedas is not admitted.

Therefore IMHO  while the  study and knowledge  of shastras  is very
important for realization of Brahman  because they echo the ultimate
truth of Brahman  the best,  so are practical methods like devotion,
meditation  and  contemplation.  The  study of  shastras  cannot  be
considered indispensible  for all  persons because the  truth though
beyond  the senses  and  the mind  is within  oneself  and what  one
eternally  is.  Therefore  no  external  aid  should  be  considered
indispensible.

I was not talking about the equivalence of the whole of Buddhism and
advaita.  I was only saying  that the highest teachings  of buddhism
and advaita, namely emptiness and Brahman are equivalent.
