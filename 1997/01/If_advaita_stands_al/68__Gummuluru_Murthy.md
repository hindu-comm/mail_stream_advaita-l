I wonder.

The object of studying vedanta is to understand what we are and secondly
to gain peace of mind.

To understand what we are, requires (sometimes) adherence to one of the
various philosophic schools of thought and interpretation. Leaving that
adherence aside and being neutral and open-minded in our inquiry,
whichever school of thought we prefer, our objective then is to have
peace and quietness of the mind.

Disturbance of the mind comes about because of our ability to think.

If only we cannot think.

Most of the List members may be aware of a program on PBS by one,
Dr. Chopra. Dr. Chopra periodically presents a show on PBS touching on
philosophy of the east. I cannot recall the title of the show (can anyone
recall ?), but it was shown four months ago by Detroit PBS during their
fund-raising weekend. Dr. Chopra says in that show: "... Human ability
is to think. Much greater ability is not to think..... ".

This leads to a question which I put sometime ago. Are mentally
underdeveloped persons farther away from knowing who they are than the
so-called "mentally well-adjusted" persons ?

On a related note, I read recently in Shri Swami Satchidananda Sarasvati's
book "The Method of Vedanta" (page 43) "The Absolute can only be revealed
through false attribution followed by retraction". Does it mean "If you
do not experience the maaya, you cannot experience the Absolute ?"
