I guess Buddha also would have  experienced the same bliss but still
he taught  emptiness.  Both say the bliss  is due to  realization of
ones  true nature.  One  calls it  Brahman and  the  other calls  it
emptiness.

>From the pAramArtha view point  nothing can exist as Brahman because
Brahman  alone IS,  so the  world does  not exist.  Now how  can one
describe the  pAramArthika state.  One may call  it either  Sunya or
pUrna.  Will it make any  difference? Saying everything  is complete
is the same as saying everything is empty.

I have not understood that Brahman is not asat so far.

I  was only  equating  sUnyata with  Brahman and  not  the whole  of
Buddhism and advaita.

In both  moksha is  a cessation  of birth and  death cycle.  I guess
Buddhists   also   will   acknowledge  in   bliss   resulting   from
enlightenment.
