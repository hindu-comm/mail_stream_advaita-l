  It is very obvious that dvaitins are not out to praise advaita or buddhism.

  But I feel that advaita distancing itself from buddhism has got to do with
  the atheistic nature of buddhism rather than the philosophy itself.

  In advaita unlike buddhism different schools of advaita give various levels of
  realities to gods, ranging from viewing them as concepts describing aspects
  of Brahman to viewing them as vyavaharika sathyas.

  However this does not change the definition of Brahman which is beyond all
  such things pertaining to the mind and hence it would be the same as
 emptiness.

  You have mentioned Vedanta in general. In advaita vedanta the unchanging
  reality is non-dual i.e it cannot be known or experienced. One can only
  be that.

  Such a reality may well be called non-existence since when a reality is
  spoken of it is spoken of in the sense that it can be known or experienced.

  But the Brahman (=atman) of advaita is beyond all knowledge and experience
  and may well be considered to be non-existent.

  When speaking of advaita vedanta in particular atma=brahman which is beyond
  all dualities. So it may be considered unreal or void as I have already
  mentioned.

  I agree that buddhists differ in their approach towards acquiring nirvana.

  However I am not sure if Shankaracharya considered shastras to be the only
  valid means of knowledge. I remember someone ( Ramakrishnan most likely I
  think ) said that Shankaracharya considered that though advaita is what
  that is taught in the shruti it could be arrived at independently by logic
  alone.

  Yes it depends on what level you compare them. Both belong to the Animal
  kingdom for example, hence both are identical.

  What I am trying to say that the highest knowledge conveyed by advaita and
  buddhism is the same which is that of Brahman or voidness.

  As I have said earlier this may be because buddhism is atheistic.
