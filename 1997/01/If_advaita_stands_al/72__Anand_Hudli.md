   No, the nondual Brahman is not experienced as something other oneself.
   It is realized as the Self. So there is no duality. And the Self is not
   a nonexistent thing or void. Jiivanmuktas who have experienced Brahman
   do not say that it is a state where they experience emptiness. Rather they
   say that it is full of bliss. There is obviously a difference between
   emptiness and bliss.

    "I am not" is not the same as "I am", for the reasons I mentioned above.
     Absence of experience of any kind is different from experience of
     bliss.

   All duality is of course illusory, but that does not imply the
   non-existence of everything. It is made abundantly clear in advaita
   that the world *as*we*commonly*perceive*it* is an illusion and is
   false. But *the*world*as*Brahman* is true and true eternally. The
   duality in the world can be negated but not the world as its substratum,
   Brahman. So not everything is false.

    Both may be the same from a commonsense point of view. Shankara in
    his commentary on the MuNDaka upanishad says that Brahman when
    explained to lay people appears as "asat", meaning nonexistence.
    It is to remove this wrong notion that the Vedas lead to Brahman in
    stages. When a person follows these stages, he will understand that
    Brahman is not a nonexistent or fictitious entity.

     Buddhism has borrowed from the jnaana kaaNDa but has probably missed
     the essence of what the jnaana kaaNDa says. Besides, for the very reason
   that Buddhism selectively borrowed some ideas from the Vedas and rejected
      others, it cannot be the same as advaita.

    I am not sure what the concept of nirvaaNa or moksha is in
   Buddhism. In advaita, moksha is not just absence of misery. Sureshvara
   differentiates between absence of misery and happiness in his sambandha
   vaartika. Every person wants to avoid all misery, but also wants
   happiness. Absence of misery and happiness are not the same. If moksha
   were to be just absence of misery, then you could say that mokshha is
   a state of void. But mokshha is a state where the superexcellent bliss
   of the Atman is tasted. It is a positive not a void.
