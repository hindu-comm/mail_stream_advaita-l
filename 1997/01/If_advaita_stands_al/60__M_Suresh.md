  But the non-dual Brahman is beyond knowledge, experience and description.
  Because knowledge implies a knower and the known which is dual,
  experience implies experiencer and experience which is dual and
  description implies description about an object which is again duality.

  Thus the non-dual Brahman would be the same as emptiness.

  Sri Ramana Maharishi modified the Upanishadic definition of Brahman "Soaham"
  meaning "That I am" to just "I am" where the subject and object dissappear
  and just the "I" is there. IMO "I am" would be the same as "I am NOT" as
  conveyed by emptiness.

  If all duality is illusory as stated by advaita then everything can be
  considered to be illusory or non-existent because knowledge or experience
  of anything implies duality.

  I think both are essentially same and it is only a choice of words.

  Quite Possible.

  If you agree that Buddhism has borrowed Jnaana Kaanda then the truth of
  the Brahman expounded in it is the same as the emptiness which is the
  highest doctrine in Buddhism.

  I do not disagree that Buddhism and advaita vary in their approach to
  Nirvana.

  This is true to a certain extent about myself. But from the net and from this
  mailing list I have observed that many advaitins have read books on buddhism,
  zen etc.
