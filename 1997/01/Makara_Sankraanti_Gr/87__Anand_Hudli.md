 Tomorrow is Makara sankraanti, the day when the Sun  is
 supposed to begin its northerly course, according to the shaastras.
 The daily worship of the Sun, three times a day or at least at dawn
 and dusk, is called the sandhyaavandana. The Vedas speak of the
 importance of the sandhyopaasana.

  Meditating on the rising and setting sun, the wise man attains all
 prosperity and security. (The Sun is to be meditated upon as)
 "This Sun is (a symbol of) Brahman." One who knows thus, being Brahman
 alone, he attains Brahman.
