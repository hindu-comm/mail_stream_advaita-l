 I admit I made a confusing remark. What I did mean to say is that
 Truth is not a pathless land, but when you reach truth the path chosen
 is not relevant. This is true of Vedaanta, because what Vedaanta
 does is to get rid of ignorance. When Brahman is realized, Vedaanta is
 irrelevant, because even Shruti ultimately is within maayaa. But it is
 a key with which we can unlock the door to Brahman. Once we open the door
 we discard the lock and key.

  True. There cannot be any injunctions for realizing Brahman. This is one
  of the important points that Shankara makes in his upadeshasaahasrii and
  Sureshvara also deals with it elaborately in his sambandha vaartika.
  The injunctions/prohibitions of the Vedas are for the purification of
  the mind. But knowledge reveals itself and is not caused by any
  external factor.
