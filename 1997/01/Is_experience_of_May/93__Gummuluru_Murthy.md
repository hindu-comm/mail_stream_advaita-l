I think you are right.

Let us imagine the following hypothetical situation. We come across a
living soul (I use the word "living soul" because I could not think of
a better word) in a cave, completely untouched and uncorrupted by the
world and the worldly ideas.

Is such a soul the Absolute ? If so, will that soul know it is the
Absolute ? (That soul knows only One, the Absolute). Will that soul
enjoy the bliss of the Absolute because such a soul did not experience
maaya ?

Our enjoyment of the bliss of satchitananada (if ever we reach or
recognize That): Will that be different from the one above because
we experienced maaya and the miseries of the world ?

I tend to feel that delusion by maaya, followed by recognition of maaya
may be necessary to see the Absolute.

That person in the cave (untouched by the world, uncorrupted by maaya),
that state: is it similar to our deep-sleep state, or the Absolute ?
