 In the morning, I remember the reality that is Atman which shines
 in (my) heart, which is existence, consciousness, and bliss, which
 is obtained by exalted sages, and which is distinct from the three
 states of dream, waking, and deep sleep. I am that partless Brahman which
 always knows the three states, dream, waking, and sleep. But I am not
 the body which is a combination of elements.

                       (praataHsmaraNastotra of Shankara)
