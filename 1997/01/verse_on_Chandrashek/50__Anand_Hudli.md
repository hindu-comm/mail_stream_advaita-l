   Today is soma-pradoshha. pradoshha is roughly 2 1/2 hours after
   sunset on any day, but the pradoshha on the 13th lunar day is
   of special significance to the worship of Shiva. Even more
   significant is such a pradoshha when it falls on a Monday, known as
   soma pradoshha, on a Tuesday, known as Bhaumapradoshha, or on a
   Saturday, known as shanipradoshha.

   In 1995, I was visiting the southern city Bangalore in India. One evening
   I happened to be passing by a Shiva temple when I heard people singing
   a beautiful hymn to Shiva - the Chandrashekhara  ashhTaka or the
   MR^ityunjaya stotra from the Padma PuraaNa. I went inside and
   joined the chorus.

   This is the first verse.

    ratnasaanusharaasanaM rajataadrishR^iN^ganiketanaM

    ratnasaanusharaasanaM - (making) Mount Meru the bow
    rajataadriShR^inganiketanaM - the resident of the peak of the
                                  Kailaasa mountain
    shiJNjiniikR^itapannageshvaraM - having made the Lord of serpents
                                     (Vaasuki) the bow-string
    achyutaanalasaayakaM - Bhagavaan VishhNu the fiery arrow
    kshhipradagdhapuratrayaM - having quickly burned up the three cities
                               of the daityas
    tridashaalayairabhivanditaM - to whom the devas (gods) bow down

    chandrashekharamaashraye - I seek refuge in Shri Chandrashekhara (Shiva)
    mama kiM karishhyati vai yamaH - what will Yama (Death) do to me?


    Lord Shiva who resides on the peak of the Kailaasa mountain, made Mount
    Meru the bow, the Lord of serpents, Vaasuki the bow-string, and Lord
    VishhNu Himself the fiery arrow. (Armed this way) Lord Shiva burned the
    three cities of the daityas, and all the gods bowed down to Him.
    I seek refuge in that Chandrashekhara. What will Yama (Death) do to me?
