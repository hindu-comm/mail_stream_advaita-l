There are certain situations where the shastras relax the stringencies of
certain vidhis 'in extremis'  For instance a person is very ill or
pregnant can be excused from fasting.  However, as soon as they are able
to, they are required to make up the vows they have missed.  But one cannot
arbitrarily decide to do or not do something especially out of laziness or
'lack of comfort.'
