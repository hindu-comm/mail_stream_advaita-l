The answer is rather simple. That there is matter is known only through the
senses and perception. What requires no perception, sensing or pramANa is the
fact that "I exist". Thus the substratum definitely has consciousness in it, at
least in part.

It cannot be matter _and_ consciousness since the absence of "real" matter in
dream and deep sleep do not negate the fact that "I exist". Thus consciousness
is ontologically prior to matter. Whether matter has an existence apart from
consciousness is something to be investigated. That's what is done in the GK
and the answer is "No".

Ramakrishnan.
