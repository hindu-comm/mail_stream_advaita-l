In this connection, read Agehananda Bharati's work, "The Light at the
Center: the context and pretext of modern mysticism" published by
Ross-Erikson, Santa Barbara, 1976. Also, "The Tantric Tradition" and "The
Ochre Robe" and "The Realm of the extra-human: agents and audiences" by
the same author.

In most language associated with a mystical insight, paradox plays a great
role. Logic cannot tolerate paradox, and it is extremely difficult, if not
impossible, in my opinion, to prove anything about the basic substratum of
the universe. Even within the highly orthodox darSanas, there are those
who hold that it is futile to hold that there exists such a substratum, or
that even if one exists, it is futile to say that it is pure non-dual
consciousness.

Bharati touches upon precisely these points, and he also holds that the
mystic's insight is psychological at one level, and that any claim to
invest it with ontological significance is fraught with danger. Yet, what
are we without our beliefs and faith? Within a given set of beliefs, I
think the ontological claims may be supported, but to make universal
statements outside the belief system can be very tricky indeed.

And as an aside, just because pointing to one's own experience begs the
question, Sankara and others rarely, if at all, refer to their personal
experience as proof.

Of course, doubt is always good to test the limits of any philosophical
system. But what I am saying is that some basic statements of any system
will have to be accepted without proof. If this is belief, there you go.
