Yes! precisely so. I might rephrase that as "fraught with ambiguity",
but the point is taken...

Exactly right!

It also may be possible to BE the truth without ever being able to
describe it or explain it to anyone else or even to oneself.  Philosophical
systems may be read into this or read out of this, while all the while
"things are as they are".  Perhaps it just doesn't matter what the truth
is, as long as there is the certain understanding that we ARE that, always
have been, always will be.  There never was nor could be anything but that
-- *whatever* that actually may be.    :-)

Thank you all for your very thoughtful replies to my assorted whining!
I am probably going to have to wrestle with it for some time to come
but I won't bother you with it anymore. You have been very kind in the
circumstances and  I appreciate your efforts more than you may know...

all the best,

Allan Curry

       Translation:

       Driven by the desire for wealth and with the intention of filling up
       my belly, I seek all people always and wander in vain. I do not know
       how to be in Your service, O all pervading Lord! (But) from the
       strength of the ripening of merit of my previous lives, O Shiva,
       (I recognize the fact that) You are the inner ruler of all. Due to
       this (understanding of mine) itself, I am to be protected by You,
       O Lord of the pashu's (souls).


       Shankara points out the delusion of the people like us in this verse.
       For the sake of filling his own belly and with an insatiable
       desire for wealth, such a person will work to gain the favors of
       worldly-minded people of wealth and power. All such endeavor will be
       vain.

       Due to the merit accumulated in past lives, such a person may somehow
       realize that God is the inner ruler of all. This person will also
       realize that serving worldly masters is absolutely futile.
       Because of this realization, Shankara argues, this person should be
       protected by God.
