It cannot be grasped.  (See Mund. 1.1.6)

It is not an object - or a subject either - but the underlying Knowledge
that illuminates and witnesses all.  (See Kena 1.4-9)

It is revealed (abhik.lpta).  (See also Mund. 3.1.8-9)

No, but there may be direct awareness of the light of the Atman, which
is reflected most purely in the buddhi, when the mind is turned away
from the objects that are illuminated by that light and towards the
Source of the light.  (See Katha 2.2.15 = Mund 2.2.10 = Svet 6.14)
By analogy, it is when the charioteer brings the carriage to a halt
and looks within.

The sense of the "Self is revealed to the mind", is that the still and
pure buddhi, reflecting the Self, seems to contribute its own nature of
being an object, to the Self, which is never an object.  This revelation,
or negation of avidyaa, is without any change whatsoever in the Self.
