I am aware that Atman is not the object. My usage of the word "grasp" is
a poor choice here. Atman is not the subject either, because Atman is
actionless, and is not participating in any "actions". With It, being
neither an object nor a subject, it is difficult to use language to
refer to It.

It (Atman) witnesses all; however, the witness description would lead
to infinite regression, because a witness requires a further witness to
witness its existence [Naishhkarmya Siddhi, verse 2.109]. Sufficient to
say that It is knowledge which is the base for all.

Now, Katha u. II.3.9 says:

Na samdr^she tishhttati ruupamasya
na cakshushhaa pashyati kashcanainam
hr^da maniishhaa manasaabhiklpto
ya etad viduramr^taaste bhavanti

Translation by Swami Sarvananda [Sri Ramakrishna Math]

The Self's form is not within the field of vision. (line 1)
None can see Him with the eyes. (line 2)
Self is revealed by the intuition of the intellect which resides in the
heart and controls the mind (line 3)
Those who know Him become immortal (line 4)

Translation by S. Radhakrishnan [The Principal Upanishhads]

Not within the field of vision stands this form.
No one soever sees Him with the eye.
By heart, by thought, by mind apprehended,
they who know Him become immortal.

Translation by Swami Ranganadhananda [Message of the Upanishhads]

His form is not within the field of sight;
none can see Him with the eye;
He is revealed in (the cavity of) the heart by the manas that is fully
under the control of the buddhi
Those who realize this become immortal.

Obviously, meaning of the line 3 of this verse is most crucial and of the
word "abhiklpto".

abhiklpto = apprehended [Radhakrishnan] ?
            well comprehended or well revealed [implied in the other
two translations.]

I think "well comprehended" is more appropriate. Practical Vedic
Dictionary by Suryakanta translates it to "manifested" with reference to
this verse.

My understanding of this is as follows: manas, diverted inward, unbothered
by the sense organs, merges with pure buddhi. If the buddhi is not pure,
manas will have some external (sensual) diversion. But, if the buddhi is
pure, manas merges with the pure buddhi. (Is there a proper word for this
state of the manas ?). The Self is revealed to such buddhi (and manas
which are the same).

The subject that visualizes the Atman is the buddhi. [Jeeva becomes buddhi
with the annihilation or merging of the body, sense organs, manas into
buddhi. If the buddhi also merges with the Atman, jeeva concept is
destroyed and there is sat-chit-ananda.

I trust my understanding is not wrong.

References given by Charles give how Atman cannot be grasped [my
understanding: by mind as we know, i.e. the mind that is subservient to
the sense organs]. This verse [Katha u. II.3.9] says how Atman reveals to
a maniisha [manasabhik.lpto] to a purified internally directed mind.
