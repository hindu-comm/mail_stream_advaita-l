Katha upanishhad tells us that further to the sense-bound activities of
the mind, there is another vital role for the mind. This vital role is
to realize the Atman when the mind merges with pure buddhi.

Mind is recognized as a bundle of thoughts flowing through. These thoughts
are triggerred by the sense organs. Katha upanishhad chariot analogy
picturizes the role of the mind very well. This role of the mind (the
reins) is to control the sense organs (the horses) so that the dharmic
buddhi (the charioteer) makes it the journey the dharmic buddhi wants,
rather than what the sense organs dictate. This role of the mind is as
a sixth sense organ or sixth sense and is externally directed. This mind
has only a limited role to play as far as inner understanding of the Self
is concerned.

Now, let us imagine our sense organs are well disciplined so that they do
not act wild and that the sense organs, the manas and the dharmic buddhi
act in unision. In such a case, the mind can be diverted internally, not
bothered by the sense organs. Such a mind can grasp Atman, because such a
mind is pure buddhi.

So, the statements in the upanishhads can be interpreted as: the human
mind, through the sense organs cannot grasp Atman, but the human mind,
diverted inward, unencumbered by the sense organs, being part of pure
dharmic buddhi can grasp Atman. Such a person, who by saadhana has
disciplined the sense organs, has inwardly directed manas merging in
pure dharmic buddhi realizes the Atman and is a jeevanmukta.

So, my statement of a few months ago that mind, being a product of
maaya, cannot grasp the Atman is only partially correct. Human mind,
if and when the sense organs are completely disciplined, and the mind
itself internally directed, can grasp the Atman.

As usual, any any comments and/or clarifications are most appreciated.
