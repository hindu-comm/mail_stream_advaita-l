Thanks Vidyasankar for an excellent exposition on knowledge and wisdom
and the roots of the word and concept in various languages and cultures.
It is a delight to read that article.

A doubt regarding the use of the word "avidya". In advaitic context, word
avidya is used to describe the effect of maaya at jeeva level. Continuing
the concepts and thinking of my initial posting and Shri Vidyasankar's
excellent response, would it not be more appropriate to use the word
"ajnanam" for the maaya at the jeeva level  rather than avidya ?

Further, what is the earliest reference for the use of the word "avidya"
in the context of advaita ?
