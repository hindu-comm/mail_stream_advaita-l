One Chinese Zen (or Chan, as it was known in China) monk has said that
"knowledge and wisdom are not the same." I remember reading this in a
book on zen (actually there are no books on zen) but am not sure what the
context was.

The same zen book I read also had a quote from a monk saying,"The Tao is not
to be grasped by the mind, but through the whole of one's being." (this quote,
interestingly enough, indicates that Zen Buddhism borrowed some ideas from
Taoism as well.)

One could say that knowledge is what one grasps through one's mind. Wisdom
is what is grasped through one's being.

In German, the verb "wissen" is used in the context of knowing something in
a "deeper" sense than "kennen." (at least, that's the way I understand it).

eg., wissen: "Wissen Sie Biologie?" (Do you know biology?)
and kennen:  "Kennen Sie ihn (ihm?)?" (Do you know him?)

There are other interesting points about German: when asking a person
whether he can understand/speak/read German, the verb "koennen" is used,
as in: "Koennen Sie Deutsch?" (literally "Can you German?").
