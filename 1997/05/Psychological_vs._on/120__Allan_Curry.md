Namaste

I have rearranged the quotes so as they scan a bit better, but the content
has been unaltered...

>>.......................................Well, why can't the experience of

What does pramana mean? If it means scriptural authority, are you saying
that the truthfulness of Advaita Vedanta *cannot* be established without
recourse to it?

>>........................................  Must we assume that energy

I was referring to consciousness-without-an-object. Are we assuming that
the energy studied by physics is an illusion or are we assuming that the
energy studied by physics is itself (at its most fundamental level)
Brahman (ie. consciousness-without-an-object)?

If memory serves, the author of "Maya in Physics" is N.C.Panda. Ring any bells?

Sorry, but could you tell me what apaurusheya means?

All the best to you...   :-)
