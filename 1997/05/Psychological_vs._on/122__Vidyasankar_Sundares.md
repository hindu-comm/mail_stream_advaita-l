pramANa means 'valid source of knowledge.' Six such sources are accepted
in vedAnta and mImAm.sA schools. These are pratyaksha - perception,
upamAna - analogy, anumAna - inference, anupalabdhi - non-cognition
(sometimes substituted with abhAva - non-being), arthApatti - postulation,
and Sabda - word (pre-eminently Sruti, in the vedAnta traditions). The
nyAya school holds that anupalabdhi and arthApatti are only special cases
of anumAna, and among the vedAnta schools, only the dvaita school agress
with them.

It is not that advaita cannot be established without Sruti, but to be true
to the vedAnta tradition, one has to recognize that it is considered a
valid source of knowledge, especially for those issues where the other
sources of knowledge fail to provide any information.

I am not very conversant with deep-level interpretations of quantum
mechanics, so I hesitate to venture an answer. But I do know that many
scientists nowadays are saying that one has to postulate a 'consciousness'
at a fundamental level. Now, whether this consciousness is itself
identical to energy or otherwise, I don't know.

> Sorry, but could you tell me what apaurusheya means?

apaurusheya = not of paurusheya origin; paurusheya derives from purusha =
person. The vedas are held to be not of human origin. Most lay listeners
are content to think that this means that the vedas are of divine origin.
However, the term 'apaurusheya' also strictly denies that the vedas were
composed by a God.

For the mImAm.sA school, this property of the veda gives it an exalted
status as a pramANa, over the other five pramANas. The apaurusheya nature
of the vedas is accepted by all teachers of vedAnta, although Sankara and
the advaitins are prepared to accept that the vedas were 'breathed out' of
brahman, just as the entire universe was 'breathed out' of brahman.
