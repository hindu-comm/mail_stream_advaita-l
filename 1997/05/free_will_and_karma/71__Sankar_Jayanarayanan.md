Approximate translation from the KaTha upanishad: "Two things approach man:
the `good' and the `pleasurable'... The wise man chooses the good, and the
unwise man the pleasurable."

On the topic of free will, Shankara writes in his commentary on the
Gita (3.34.0) " The following objection may be raised: If all living beings
behave according to nature -- and there is none devoid of his own special
nature -- there remains no scope for individual initiative, and the Shastra
(scripture) is thus reduced to futility.

Answer:
Gita (3.34) "Senses have attachment and aversion to their respective objects;
none should be swayed by them. They indeed are obstacles in man's path." "

Shankara's commentary: "The senses have attachment and aversion in respect of
their objects such as sound -- attachment to what pleases and aversion to what
repels. Thus attachment and aversion are inevitable for each sense. In this
context, the scope of the individual and that of the mandate of the Shastra are
being indicated. Submitting to the mandate of the shastra at the very outset,
one should refuse to be swayed by attachment and aversion. Human nature indeed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
forces man to work under the urges of his attachment and aversion. Thus result
the abandonment of one's conduct and conformity with those of alien conduct. On
the other hand when attachment and aversion are restrained by countervailing
forces, man's vision becomes that of the Shastra; he ceases to be Nature's
thrall. Therefore none should submit to attachment and aversion; for those are
stumbling blocks on the path to betterment, like robbers infesting the public
road."

The only "will" in us is the will to like or dislike what is perceived
through the senses. The Shastra teaches us not to be disturbed by sensory data.

The Self-realized man sees the Self as actionless.

Advaita explains this "will of the absolute" by the concept of Saguna Brahman,
the impartial Ishvara who "takes care" of the living beings and the world.
Madhusudana Sarasvati's works explain this.
