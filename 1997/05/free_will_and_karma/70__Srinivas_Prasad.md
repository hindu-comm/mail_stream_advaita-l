To Be precise about free will and karma one can conclude, Every thing
(Action , karma etc) at MICRO Level looks Free will but once you draw
a log scale at MACRO level it is Destiny!!!!. Nothing is Free will
it only appeared to you (all) that it was in your hand. AT MACRO level
 It was not in your hand.
