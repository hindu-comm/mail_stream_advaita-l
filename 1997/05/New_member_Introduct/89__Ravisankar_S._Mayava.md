Dear Ravi,

namaskAram.

My name is Sreeram. I graduated with BE in Mechanical Engineering from PSG Tech
in 1988. Worked in Bangalore for 3 years. Came to USA for masters degree in
1991. Graduated with MSME in 1993 and have been working at Ford Motor Company
since then.

My parents live in Kumbakonam and all my schooling took place there. Thats
where I go when I go to India. Our house is right on the banks of river
Cauvery.

The reason I sent you the mail personally to include me as
psreeram at technologist.com and not as psreeram at ford.com is because I am planning
on moving to Singapore in a couple of months. I will be joining the Institute
of Systems Science, a research institute attached to National University of
Singapore. I shall forward my email from there once I move to Singapore.

I am a neophyte as far as philosophies are concerned. But I am interested in
knowing more. I was visiting Vidya's (Caltech) homepage that has the FAQ of
advaitam and saw that there is a listserve for advaitam that discusses the
philosophy. I have been drawn towards advaitam philosophy of late. I dont know
why. I recently bought Dr. S.Radhakriahnan's book on Upanishad and I have been
reading about Vedanta. Since I am in the very early stages of learning and I am
thoroughly confused by the terminology and concepts of advaitam. It is my wish
to learn more by listening to the more knowledgable ones in the list.
'satsangatvE nissangatvam'!

I look forward to getting enlightened by listening to the knowledgable ones. I
hope my child-like questions on advaitam and vedanta will be answered in this
forum.

Warm regards
Sreeram
