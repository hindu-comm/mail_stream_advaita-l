Dear Ravi,

I am 45 years old and have been interested in self-realization since I was
about 20 or 21.  I began mantra meditation around that time (TM) but soon
abandoned it.  Not long afterwards I became interested in the teachings of
George Gurdjieff and Peter Ouspensky, chiefly because of the idea of
self-remembering, which seemed to me a more direct path to the Self than
using a mantra.  I was part of a Gurdjieff-Ouspensky group for a few years,
but later left because it became evident to me that though there was value
in the basic teachings, the particular group I was involved with had become
(and probably was all along) a cult designed to feed the teacher's ego.
Around age 26 I began to explore yoga, and became especially interested in
jnana yoga.  I also became interested in Ramana Maharshi.  I also
investigated Buddhism, particularly Zen and Vipassana.  In the '80s I read
with great interest the books of R.P. Kaushik and J. Krishnamurti.  In
about 1988 I encountered Dr. Jean Klein, an Advaita teacher who apparently
became established in the Self back in the 1950s while living in India.  I
have attended several seminars put on by Dr. Klein since then, and I
consider him my primary teacher.  I have also read. and found great value
in, books by Nisagardatta Maharaj, Ramesh Balsekar, and Atmananda (Krishna
Menon).

I am happily married, with two daughters, ages 4 and 1.  I make my living
as a court reporter here in Seattle, Washington, USA.  My practice now is
to simply be present to what is happening here and now, to watch the inner
and outer drama unfold.  You could call this practice self-inquiry,
self-remembering, mindfulness, and no doubt there are many other names for
it.  Occasionally this practice takes the form of silent sitting or moving
meditation, but more often it takes place in the normal activities of daily
life.

Thank you for welcoming me to the list.

Mark Hovila
