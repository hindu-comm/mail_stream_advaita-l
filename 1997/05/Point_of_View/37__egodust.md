All the so-called 'answers' you're alluding to aren't what they're
trumped up to be.  They're, at best, temporary palliatives or
philosophical aids whose function is to deliver the individual's
awareness back to its source.  The very word 'religion' was taken
from 're-ligio,' which is latin for 're-linking the individual back
to his/her original state.'  Same derivation behind 'yoga.'

This *sounds* like a valid objection, but is it?  Aren't we
after the truth, irrespective of whether or not it's associated
with what may *appear* to be a path of least resistance?

The first question we're philosophically and ethically obligated
to ask is: "What's going on here?...viz. what is all this, anyway?"
And, secondly,  "According to who, is [such] potential assessment
forthcoming?"

The immediate implication is that the individual self is not only
the witnessing filter, but is perhaps even the *creator* of that
which he's witnessing (this world event).  (The drishti-shristhi
vaada school of thought.)

What sequentially follows from this line of reasoning is the matter
of "What is the nature of this 'Who'?"...viz. "Who am I?"...which
represents the alpha and omega of *all* questions!  In turn, the
implication here becomes the possibility of the Universal Atman
as the Effulgent Substratum behind all egos, gods, and worlds--
which are seen as merely products of Its power of maya.  This
leads us to the fundamental matter of viveka.


OM Shaanthi.  Namaste.
