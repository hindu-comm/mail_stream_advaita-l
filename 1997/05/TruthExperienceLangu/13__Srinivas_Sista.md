Disclaimer: The following questions are only meant to engender enquiry.

Now how are you going to prove that? Where did you infer that from?
Or is it your definition of truth? If it is somebody else's definition,
what made you accept that? What is the status of a truth that is validated
only through language and logic and not otherwise? How sure are you that
language and logic are not a result of your being drunk or feverish or
any number of other things? Why are the chirpings of birds unintelligible,
whereas the blabbering of humans suddenly acquire enormous significance?
Why are patterns of grass/leaves meaningless whereas scribblings of humans
carry lot of meaning? How broad is this truth which you are formulating, if
it is only objective and constant?

regards,
Srinivas Sista.
