It's as if you have not seen the word advaitism, before?  Is this possible
from such a learned man?

Language mediates experience.

If you miss the point you miss its foundation.  Jesus had many allegiences
with the beliefs of the Pharisees, but he brought a conceptual revolution
nonetheless.  Citing commentators that weave Shankara with the Mimamsakas
does not address the issue.  There are Jews for Jesus who keep kosher.

See, there's that doubt, again.  The term is new to you.  Say it ain't so!

Now hold on.  Until you come clean on whether or not you've seen the term
advaitism before let's have not be casting stones.  See, I would have to
believe that you have seen it, but forgot it.

The ones in my neck of the woods value Menachem Mendel Schneerson above
all.  But comparisons would not be relevant to them.  It would be like
asking Vivekananda whether he preferred the Ashtavakra Gita to Ramakrishna.
 By the way, does that text fit into your self-constructed Talmud of
Advaita Vedanta?


>>But at any rate, if any mystical or religious tradition penetrates to a
deep, spiritual truth, then its relevance to Advaitism seems to be secure.

Now you've done it.  It's time for a quiz.  What eminent Indian Philosopher
begins his account of Advaita Vedanta with this sentence:  "The Advaitism
of Samkara is a system of great speculative daring and logical subtlety."?

I am happy to contemplate the true nature of an apple as it relates to
Brahman.  It sincerely makes me happy to do so.  It will become my Zen Koan
for awhile.  I am not being facetious, I truly thank you.  May I offer a
lesser gift concerning leaves?  Wittgenstein, in a lecture, invited his
audience to consider autumn leaves floating to the ground, saying to
themselves "Now I'll go this way...now I'll go that way."

 > Jiva = Brahman.  It's as simple as that.

Well, not quite as simple as car=automobile, but simple, nonethess.
Intelligible if coupled with a belief in free will is another matter.
