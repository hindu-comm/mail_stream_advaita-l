The sAm.khya school postulates a plurality of purushas based simply on
their logic.

If everything including brahman can be negated, so can the notion of I.
This is what most Buddhist schools do. They hold that even the "I" is
nothing but an aggregate of different momentary things, and is therefore
not eternal.

Brahman is more than a concept that accounts for creation. If the goal of
vedAnta is to properly account for creation, then the very diversity of
creation calls for a diversity of causes. Why should bAdarAyaNa have
postulated a unitary brahman and then created problems for all later
interpreters?

Scripture says, yes there are many Atmans, and then it says, there is only
One Atman. Scripture has been purposely designed to operate through
adhyAropa-apavAda (sublation of superimposition). The problem of the one
and the many will persist for all time to come, and will continue to
exercise the best philosophical minds, with a multitude of answers.
However, the other schools of vedAnta do not recognize this feature of
Sruti, that what is superimposed is later denied.

Happiness is a psychological state, and certainly one can reach a state of
happiness while holding that the I is not eternal. Most Buddhist monks I
have met seem to have an intense amount of happiness, yet they negate both
the notion of an eternal I and a brahman.

I should think that the bRhadAraNyaka upanishad's account of yAjnavalkya's
teaching (maitreyI brAhmaNa) is pretty much categorically clear about the
status of duality and non-duality.

The Buddhist will tell you that SUnyatA is not a state that exists out
there. The I that is held to be an aggregate, is seen to be non-eternal,
there is nothing else eternal, that is why everything is described as
being SUnya. To even say that a SUnya state exists, is to seriously
misrepresent the very concept of SUnyatA.

Not so. The logic of your argument has started by defining the real as
that which is trikAlAbAdhita vastu - that which is not sublated in the
past, present and future. Why operate, on a solely logical basis, with
such a restrictive definition? How does one know that something will not
be negated in the future? In fact, part of the reason why dvaita differs
so sharply from advaita in its conclusions is that this school does not
hold to such a definition for reality. So one can have different systems
of logic, and come to different conclusions. The fact that there are many
interpretations of Sruti does not mean that Sruti is ambiguous or
unnecessary. Rather, it can only be that differences in interpretation
arise due to differences in basic assumptions and that these differences
are no fault of Sruti itself.
