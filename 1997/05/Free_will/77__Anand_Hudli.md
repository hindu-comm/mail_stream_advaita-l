The discussion on free will is interesting but I could not help
noticing the relevance of God's will to the discussion. God or Ishvara has His
own power or will and is free to exercise it in any way He likes. From a
purely "theistic" viewpoint, it is possible to argue that this will of God
represents the ultimate in free will and the fact that free will is
undeniable. Of course, from an advaitic viewpoint, Ishvara leads to
Brahman ultimately and Brahman is devoid of any change or action. So
there cannot be a free will at that stage. For, will implies change
and change implies activity. Kashmir Shaivism makes a distinction
between activity and action, saying activity (kriyaa) is something
that Ishvara engages in spontaneously or causelessly, but action
 (karma) is the kind of deliberative action that we mortals engage in.
But advaita makes no such distinction between activity and action.
That is because, again, activity and action alike bring about change
or transformation. Brahman is without transformation (nirvikaara).
Or in other words, since Brahman is the only Reality, transformation
is impossible.

I will write more on this later.
