Jaladhar, you've lost me! If Karma and Jnana are not interlinked, what would the
jnani do after attaining enlightment? Wouldn't his wisdom be wasted if he just
sat around? Isn't it his duty to spread his wisdom and work towards the
betterment of the world? And goodness, which is an attribute of the Brahman, not
naturally lead him towards karma?

And doesn't one's dharmic duties include service to the needy? And whose dharmic
obligation is it to feed the poor? If service and help to the needy isn't Karma
Yoga, then what is?

PS : And how're Socialist do-gooders responsible for India's woes???
