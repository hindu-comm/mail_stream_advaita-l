Presumably he would live out the rest of his prarabdha karma then die
never to return.

Maybe but there's plenty more where that came from.

Would that be the same world he has just realized is less than real?

As said previously, for the sake of lesser beings he may continue to do
work but there is no obligation.  This is in contrast to a householder who
commits a great sin by failing to perform his duties.  Also what is really
good may not be obvious at first sight.  Look at the Bhagavad Gita.
Krishna Bhagavan is ordering Arjuna to wage a war which will result inthe
deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.  That's not what most people
would consider social work!

No.

It is the obligation of each person to feed themselves.  No one else is
responsible.

To perform the duties set forth in the shastras as appropriate to ones,
age, gender, caste, and station in life.

Political discussions are rather off-topic for this list but I will say
that for all its apparent heartlessness the capitalist free market system
has benefited far more people than socialism ever could.
