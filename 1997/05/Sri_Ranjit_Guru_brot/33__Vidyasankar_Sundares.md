Dear readers,

This post is a forwarded message that I got by private email. I'm sure
members of this list might want to meet Sri Ranjit when he is in the US.

Best wishes,

Vidyasankar

 visit US + Europe

THE RAREST OF  EVENTS
_________________________________________________________________
Sri Ranjit Maharaj and Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, author of "I AM
THAT were both disciples of Sri Siddha Rameshwar Maharaj.  Both are
Sadgurus and represent the same spiritual lineage.  Less well-known
in the West, many of Sri Nisargadatta's Indian devotees came to Sri
Ranjit after Sri Nisargadatta passed away.

AT THE YOUNG AGE OF 84, SRI RANJIT MAHARAJ HAS
GENEROUSLY CONSENTED TO VISIT THE SAN FRANCISCO,
HOUSTON AND WASHINGTON DC AREAS.  AS WELL, HE WILL
VISIT FRANKFURT AND PARIS. SEE BOTTOM FOR DATES AND
CONTACT PERSONS.

In Maharaj's gentle, realized presence we are invited into an over-
arching understanding that relieves us of "getting it" and "losing
it". Here the "gradual" and "sudden" paths are reconciled.  Bhakti
and Vedanta or Discrimination and Compassion are a seamless unity.
Maharaj brings us the fire from the other side of the heart, the
love of the Self for the Self that is the essence of spiritual
relationship.

Sri Ranjit, born in 1913, met Sri Siddha Rameshwar at the age of 12
and was recognized at the age of 14.  He lived with his Guru from
1924 to 1936.   Sri Ranjit Maharaj teaches in the same form as his
own guru who advocated major focus on  "UNDERSTANDING".  Simple
language is used to pierce through ignorance to realize spiritual
reality. Every human being is competent to understand the Supreme
Truth.

A realized being is a walking garden offering spiritual
refreshment. Maharaj's simplicity in living and straightforward
teaching has attracted many disciples in India and abroad.  This is
an uncommon opportunity to enjoy the intimate holy company of Sri
Ranjit Maharaj.
