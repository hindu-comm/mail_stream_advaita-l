Ramakrishnan, whether or not the Lord has free will is not the topic of the
discussion. I am not going to argue this point, for the answer is clear,
once one ceases to believe in one's own free will. Let us agree through our
own determinations that free will for humans is illusory, then we can
discuss the nature of the Lord's actions.

Regards,
Cameron Reilly
