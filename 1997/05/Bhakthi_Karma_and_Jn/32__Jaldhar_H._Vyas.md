Actually, the division into three is rather artificial and mostly stems
from the imagination of Vivekananda.  Most of the Advaita works deal with
Karma vs Jnana and are vehement the two cannot be combined.

It would have been the Jnana that led him to Brahman, not the singing.

If Karma Yoga means anything it means the dispassionate performance of
ones _Dharmic_ duties.  Even if Mother Theresa were a Hindu, her social
work wouldn't count as Karma Yoga unless there was a Dharmic obligation to
feed the poor.  There isn't.  Which doesn't mean it isn't a good thing
(though it can be argues that Socialist do-gooders are responsible for
much of modern Indias woes.)  It just means it isn't Karma Yoga.

In the Bhagavad Gita Krishna Bhagavan says a Jnani has no need of
performing action.  He does it merely as an example for lesser people.
