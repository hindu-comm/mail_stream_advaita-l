What? "Just having Jnana without Karma and Bhakti is useless"
What is the meaning of "Just having Jnana"?
The supreme goal of all the three yogas is "Jnana".
So, one can follow one of the three yogas to attain "Jnana".
Jnana Yoga is the direct approach to attain "Jnana" by removing the
agnana through enquiries.
Bhakthi and Karma Yogas are used to attain "Jnana" by removing the
agnana through Bhakthi and Karma.

Our dharma is indeed dictated by what was written by Shri Anand Hudli. My
response was with regard to kaala-dharma, i.e. the change of dharma with
time.

Let us look at the four above. The vedas are eternal. They said the same
thing a few thousand years ago, now and thousand years hence. So, dharma
does not change with time according to vedas. Thus, if we follow vedas
only, the question of kaala-dharma does not arise. Dharma is same for all
time. As Shri Anand Hudli says, smriti is sub-ordinate to vedas anyway.

The thing that changes with time are 3 and 4 above. I mean here by
conscience, the buddhi, the discriminator between the Real and unreal.
One's buddhi is determined by the past experiences and tendencies and
past lives. Thus (3) above determines (4).

Question of kaala-dharma is simply what sort of a short-cut one takes.
That is, simply, what choice of a pleasant rather than the good. [Pardon
me for using the terminology of Katha u. in these matters as that is the
one I am constantly reflecting on now]. Buddhi is always there to question
the choice. If the pleasant is chosen rather than the good, buddhi is
there to question. Purer the buddhi is, the better your choice of the
course of action (choosing the sreyah rather than the preyah) and stronger
the buddhi questions the short-cut chosen.

Ultimately, while what one's dharma is proscribed in vedas, what course of
action one takes and how close it is to the right action depends on one's
buddhi. It is always there and one has to answer it.

Shri Anand Hudli gives example of alcoholic consumption. My response to
that example is the same. Whether the jeeva regards alcoholic consumption
as an acceptable norm (to the jeeva) depends on jeeva's buddhi. The jeeva
knows what the vedas have stated about it. Whether the jeeva makes amends
to it (to what the vedas say) and accepts alcohol depends on the
upbringing of the jeeva, with buddhi the discriminator between the Real
and the unreal making the decision.
