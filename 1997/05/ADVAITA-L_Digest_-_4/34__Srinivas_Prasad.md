   In all the three cases One is interlinked with the other. Bhakti can come
  only by removing agnana. This leads to pure devotion, which will get
  transformed in doing Nishkamakarma. At later stage one will attain
   Jnana yoga by Sadhana. Just having Jnana with out Karma and Bhakti
  is useless.

  Example: Purandara dasa's Agnana was removed by The Incidence happend
  to him in his life which led to Pure devotion and 24 hrs attachement
  to god which is nothing but Nishkamakarma. By constant sadhana he showed
  us that Jnana yoga can be achieved.
