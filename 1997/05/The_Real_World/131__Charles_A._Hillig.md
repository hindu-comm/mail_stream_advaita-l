     Here's another thought:  Perhaps the so-called "reality" of both the
physical and the non-physical world manifests in your consciousness only in
direct proportion to the degree of your ATTACHMENT to  them.

     The Self, however, is "unattachable" and stands alone without an opposite.

                                                     With Blessings,

                                                          Chuck Hillig
