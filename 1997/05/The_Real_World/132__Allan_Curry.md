Given that Gaudapada says, "This is the highest Truth, that nothing is ever
born" did you perhaps mean to say "The physical world *seems* to exist" ?
..... "the trees, the earth and the galaxy *seem* to exist" ???

I always thought it was the world that was represented by the snake in the
snake-in-the-rope analogy. Please, Advaita Vedanta experts, clear up this
confusion... Is it true in Advaita Vedanta that "The physical world exists"
???

HUMOR=ON

Maybe God was misquoted in the Jewish bible's book of Genesis and actually
said, " IF there was light..."   instead of "Let there be light"!  :-)
