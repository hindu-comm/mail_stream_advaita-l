O Lord whose head bears the crescent moon! I do not have the blemishes
of inertness (laziness), beastliness, impurity, and crooked movement.
Even if I have those blemishes, am I not still eligible to be Your
ornament?

Adi Shankara, in this soul-stirring verse, says to Lord Shiva that
a devotee is fit to be accepted by Him regardless of whether or not
there are blemishes in the devotee. Shankara's reasoning is impeccable,
as usual. Has not Lord Shiva accepted less than perfect things as His
ornaments? The crescent moon is imperfect, not blemishless. The snakes
worn by Lord Shiva move about crookedly. Lord Shiva accepts inert
objects like hides of an elephant or tiger as ornaments. He accepts
the bull as His vehicle. So if a devotee has these defects, how can
he/she lose his/her eligibility to become Lord Shiva's ornament?
