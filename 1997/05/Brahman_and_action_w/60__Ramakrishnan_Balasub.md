There are two ways Atman is "described":

1. by the neti neti statement
2. by sarvaM khalvidaM brahma

The first is from the point of view of ajAti, the final conculsion of
vedAnta. Thus anything other than brahman, i.e., the so called
phenomenal existence is denied.

The second is when an empirical reality is admitted. In this case
vedAnta says that these are not really true, they are perceived due to
mAyA only. But any illusion requires a substratum and Atman is the
substratum. Thus sarvaM khalvidaM brahma. This corresponds to the
analogy you have given above.

shrI sha.nkara makes this point clear in his commentary on the gauDapAda
kArikA-s.

That brahman acts, it has a free-will and so on is an idea propogated by
the shAkta-s and tAntrik schools like the Kashmir Shaivism. It is not
admitted by vedAnta. I believe I mentioned this in my previous post on
this topic.

Ramakrishnan.
