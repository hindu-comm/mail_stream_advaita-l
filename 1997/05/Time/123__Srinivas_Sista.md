Why invent sense organs, say that they are directed outwards,
postulate that they should be turned inwards to still time and
assume that this is the recipe to shattering the shackles of
maya(another invention)? What is the inner and what is the outer?
Why this dichotomy? Where is the border?
(examine the responses of the mind to these questions and that
will reveal its predilections)
