Today happens to be the day when we celebrate the appearance of Lord
Narasimha, the  lion-headed incarnation of Vishnu. According to
the PuraaNas, Narasimha emerged from a pillar when the demon king
HiraNyakashipu challenged the lad Prahlaada to show him where God is.
After killing the demon king and his army of demons, the Lord accepted
the prayers of His devotee Prahlaada and made him the king. The story
of Prahlaada and the Narasimha avatar is told in detail in the
Bhaagavata and also the Vishnu PuraaNa, although the two versions are
not the same. Devotees offer prayers to Narasimha today, especially
during the evening twilight period.

According to the Bhaagavata, Narasimha was extremely fierce (ugra), so
no god could approach Him to pacify Him. Even His consort Lakshmi was
afraid to approach Him. So Brahmaa asked Prahlaada, the ideal devotee
to make the Lord's mood peaceful with prayers.

In two striking verses in the Bhaagavata, Prahlaada says that he is not
afraid of the fierce form of the Lord. He is not afraid of the Lord's
lion face, His eyes as bright as the sun, His sharp teeth and claws,
His roars that strike terror in the hearts of enemies. What Prahlaada is
afraid of is the havoc that is the fierce samsaaric existence, ugra-
samsaara-chakra-kadana.

I am including a few verses from Shankara's Lakshmi-Narasimha stotra,
a translation of which I posted last year on the usenet newsgroups.

 The tree of worldly existence arises from the seed of sin. Its
 numerous branches are the endless actions (karmas), its leaves are the
 organs of the body, its flower is passion (kaama), its fruit is sorrow.
 Having ascended this tree, I am now falling down.
 O compassionate  Lakshminrsimha, provide me the support of Your hands.

 In the forest conflagration of worldly existence (illusion), I have been
 burned badly. Even every single hair on my body has been burned by
 large and fearful columns of flames. In this condition I have
 sought the shelter of the cool lake that is Your lotus feet.
 O Lakshminrsimha, provide me the support of Your hands.

 O Lord!  My great wealth called power of discrimination (viveka) has
 been  stolen away by the powerful thieves called senses.
 I am blind (without the power of discrimination between things eternal
 and noneternal). In this condition, I have been pushed into the dark
 well called delusion. O Lakshminrsimha, provide me the support of Your
 hands.

 I have been bound by hundreds of snares of worldly attachments.
 The soldiers of Yama (Death) have cast their noose around my neck and
 are dragging me along, threatening me. I am alone, frightened, and
 without any independence. O compassionate Lakshmi nrsimha, provide me
 the support of Your hands.

 In one hand You hold the (sudarshana) discus; in another You
 hold the (paanchajanya) conch; another hand rests on (the waist of)
 the daughter of the ocean, Lakshmi; and the (fourth) hand signifies
 that You bestow boons and drive away the fear (of the devotees).
 O Lakshmi nrsimha provide me the support of Your hands.

 Being drowned in the ocean of samsaaric existence, I am deluded.
 O Lord! O Treasure of compassion! Turn your glance toward me who am
 helpless. (Just as You) assumed the Supreme avatar for the purpose of
 eradicating the sorrow of Prahlaada, do You, Lakshmi nrsimha, provide
 me the support of Your hands.

 You dwell in the hearts of the best of the Bhaagavatas, such as
 Prahlaada, Naarada, Paraashara, PunDariika, and Vyaasa. You are like the
 desire-fulfilling tree in protecting the loyal devotees.
 O Lakshmi nrsimha, provide me the support of Your hands.
