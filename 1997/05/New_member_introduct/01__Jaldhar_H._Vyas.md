For that matter falling down a flight of stairs can lead to an experience
of non-duality.  We're talking about Advaita Vedanta here.

As I wrote earlier today, a thing even the propositions of Advaita Vedanta
is either true or it's false.  It cannot depend on the experience or a
lack thereof of any person particularly a person like Ramakrishna whose
connection to the Advaita parampara was tenuous at best.  I don't think a
belief in Vedanta requires abandoning free will.  If you believe otherwise
you can try and prove it but that requires the use of things Advaita
considers authority sush as Shruti, Smrti, logic, tradition etc.  not
utterly irrelevant things.
