Namaste,
        I came across about this list when I was surfing through the
Sanskrit documents lists. A brief introduction about self:
I am Giridharan Krishnamurthy, Male, age 29, born and living in Madras,
India, an Engineer by profession. As to the question why I got interested
in Advaita, I dont just know why!! More than this there is nothing much
to say.
Hope this is ok.
Thanks and waiting to hear from you,
Giri
