I am thinking about the concept of Time. Concept of Time may be
regarded as the biggest hurdle in our Realization of the Atman or may
be the most intuitive concept in worldly matters. How we see it depends
on how much we are covered by avidya. I have put some of my random
thoughts below, and as usual, would be most grateful for clarification/
comments.

Just like jeeva goes through cycles of births and rebirths, kaala also
goes through cycles, although it is considered uni-directional.
Scientifically, measurement of Time is based on periodicity of events.
My concept is that the Kaala is in our mind only. If the sense organs
are directed inward, there would be no Time. Everything would be still.
If the eyes are directed inward, we do not see the light and darkness
outside us and the change of light and darkness with time. Similarly,
with the other sense organs. That is, Time is what is perceived by the
sense organs and is within the realm of maaya. Just like jeeva concept
doesn't exist once Realization is made, similarly, the Time will be
NOW only once the sense organs are directed inward and mind is stilled.

The concept that things are changing has come about because we draw
mentally a graph of any particular quantity versus time and see that the
quantities change. Any change perceived is a result of maaya. If we plot
these parameters as a function of Atman (assuming that we see a difference
between these parameters and Atman), we see that these quantities do not
change. If we plot time as a function of Atman, we do not see any change
in time either. There is no past or future, only the present.

To conclude, if the sense organs are directed inward, we do not see a
change of Time. If we see that the Time is stilled, we are well on our
way of shattering the shackles of maaya. My interpretation of Katha
upanishhad (verse (II.1.1) is that it is a curse that sense organs are
directed outward, which is responsible for all maaya-related concepts
acquired by the jeeva.

Can the learned members of the List suggest good references on advaitic
thinking of Time. I came across some discussions by McTaggart, Whitrow
etc based on western philosophy. But Time plays such an important role
in advaita that I am sure Shri Shankara and later advaitins discussed
it fully. Any reference is appreciated.

becomes immortal, and attains Brahman even here.
