According to advaita vedAnta free will is also due to mAyA only (but not
in the sense Cameron was claiming sometime back). I thought that Charles
had stated the position of advaita vedAnta on this in a crystal clear
fashion. Brahman having a will (which is not a manifestation of mAyA) is
a concept of Kashmir Shaivism not advaita vedAnta. They call this the
ichchA shakti. Refer gauDapAda kArikA-s or the mAnasollAsa where this
tenet is refuted. I had given the relevant quote from the mAnasollAsa,
where sureshvarAchArya refutes absolute reality to free will, sometime
back.

Ramakrishnan.
