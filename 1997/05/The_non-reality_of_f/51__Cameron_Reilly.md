Ramakrishnan,

I believe I also demonstrated some weeks ago, through a variety of Maharshi's quotes, that he would & did support the position of non-volition, as does every jnani.

We can all extract quotes and use them to our purpose. I am trying to encourage the members of the list to look within for their answers, not to quotes.


Warmest Regards,

Cameron

No it would not. Please stop using Maharshi's quotes out of context to
promote your ideas about free-will. It has been demonstrated with a
variety of quotes that the Maharshi would not support your concept of
free-will.
