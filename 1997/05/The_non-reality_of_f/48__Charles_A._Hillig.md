     Actually, since Brahman can't be compared nor contrasted to anything,
we immediately run into our usual problem trying to describe the indescribable.

     I still really like Maharshi's brilliant metaphor about the Self  being
somewhat like a movie screen.   All of the action (which implies change)
that seemingly takes place on the screen is illusory....no matter how real
it appears.  The only Reality is the unbroken, seamless Screen Itself  that
is "supporting" whatever movie that is being projected.

      The Screen, Itself, neither condones nor condems anything because it
doesn't judge a story line as being right, wrong, good or bad   With
complete equanimity, It accepts ALL of the "movies" equally.....comedies,
farces , melodramas and tragedies.

      And remains totally untouched by them all.

                           With Blessings,
