If my scholarship were so great I were never wrong, there would be no
point to me even reading this list.  But I post because it is always
helpful to check ones views against those others to make sure they are not
just the result of self-delusion.  So if something I say is wrong, or
badly said, or confusing, let me know.  The worst that can happen is
you will be proved wrong :-)
