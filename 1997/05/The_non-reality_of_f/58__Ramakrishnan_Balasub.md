This is not the position of advaita nor any of the usual teachers. A
glance at the `Talks with Ramana Maharshi' will be enough to prove this.
In any case, Giri presented the relevant quotes. So far you have neither
presented any valid reason nor the statements of any proper guru.
Further this statement is enough to show that you did not read any of
Charles' posts. This is my last posting on this subject.

Ramakrishnan.
