It would be useful if what one says and what somebody else says are
clearly demarcated using > or some other sign in every post.
Otherwise it gets very confusing. The pUrvapaksha and the arguments
against it can be more easily distinguished in traditional bhAshya texts
than in some recent posts on this list!
