In fact it does do everything.  It is everything.  So you cannot say
Brahman lacks free will.  The individual soul or atma is not different
from Brahman.  (You wanted a quote.  Ahambrahmasmi.)  It only considers
itself different because of Maya or delusion.  Therefore only the
delusional person will think he is not free.  In truth you are as free as
Brahman is."

Well at least one point of agreement:  Brahman is limitless.   But his
interpretation of  "I am the absolute" has a logical flaw so obvious I
expect others to jump in before I return on Monday.  I'll respond to the
rest of his crackling commentary then as well.
