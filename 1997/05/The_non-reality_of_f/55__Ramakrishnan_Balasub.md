Not the way you think. It's quite clear that you have read none of the
posts on this topic and continue to make obtuse and tangential remarks.
Quotes were also posted by Giri where the Maharshi makes it clear that
one has to make an effort to follow the shastra-s and that involves
free-will. There is no free-will in the absolute sense _because_ there
is no action in the first place. However if you admit something acts
then there is free-will. Charles pointed out the fallacies of your
thinking quite well.

This is exactly why I asked you to stop taking maharshi's quotes out of
context.

Thanks for the encouragement. However remember that inner voices told
Jeffrey Dahmer what to do and inner voices also told Idi Amin what to
do. This inner voice bussiness is usually resorted to by people only
when they cannot logically explain their position.

Ramakrishnan.
