Certainly there is. It's called day dreaming. One thing I should make clear
here is that the dream state refers to the pure dreaming state and nothing
else. Lucid dreaming, day dreaming etc are all considered waking state and
nothing else.

I am afraid I don't follow. And what is meant by "utilise"? AFAIK, lucid dreams
are totally worthless, except for getting research grants for people who do
research on them :-).

Why rightly? As far as I can see lucid dreaming is a product of a hyperactive
imagination of some one in the waking state and nothing else.

Ramakrishnan.

PS: Lucid dreams get lot of attention in the popular press, however it seems
that it is not much different from the day-dreams of some one with a
particularly hyperactive imagination. Let's not get into discussions of alpha,
beta waves etc from the brain since Swami Rama clearly showed that these can be
controlled by enough will power.
