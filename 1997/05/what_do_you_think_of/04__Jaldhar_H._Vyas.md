It's an odd definition of Bhakti that doesn't mention God.  A traditional
definition of Bhakti is Shravana (hearing stories about Bhagavan), Manana
(thinking constantly about Bhagavan), and kirtan (singing the names and
stutis of Bhagavan.)  A Bhakta considers himself to be Bhagavans servant
or das.  I don't see what other beings have to do with it.  Arjun trusted
Krishna Bhagavan so much that at his behest he slaughtered his entire
family.  That's hardly unconditional love is it?

It's a step up from Herman Hesse but you can do a lot better.
