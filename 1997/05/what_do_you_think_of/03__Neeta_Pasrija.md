Namaste:
I (the gross, subtle and causal body) think it is a beautiful passage.
Siddhartha is a beautiful book that captures the struggles of a young Indian
but by itself is not sufficient for the understanding of Advaita.

In response to your earlier query of the 3 paths:

1. BHAKTI YOGA:  Unconditional love and acceptance of everything and every
being;
2. KARMA YOGA:  Action without attachment to the fruits;
3. JNANA YOGA:   Knowledge;

Depending on our latent tendencies one of these appeals to us.  But that is
only a *start*.  None of these by itself is sufficient for Nirvana.  Whichever
one you get started on, must take you through the other two, with eventually
all three converging into ONE.  Unity,  OM.

Bhakti without Karma Yoga and Jnana yoga  can lead to superstitions,  pointless
rituals and fanaticsm
Karma without Bhakti and Jnana yoga  can lead to attachment to the fruits and
thus Samsara
Jnana without Bhakti and Karma  can lead to pride and feeding the ego.

Recommended Reading:  Anything by  Swami Vivekananda.  You can find his works
