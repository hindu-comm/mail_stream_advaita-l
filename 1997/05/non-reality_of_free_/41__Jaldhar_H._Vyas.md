As Advaitism seems to be something you just invented, I don't know.  As
for Advaita Vedanta, I'd say there is very little which doesn't require at
least an initial suspension of disbelief.  If you're going to take a
skeptical view, Why stop with the Apaurusheyatva of the Vedas when there
are much easier targets.

You haven't experienced the authors of the Vedas so why should this
concept make less or more sense to you?

Another unfounded assertion.  From the very beginning the two traditions
have been intertwined.  Jaimini the author of the Mimamsa Sutras is
mentioned several times in the Brahma Sutras.  Badarayana the author of
the Brahma Sutras is mentioned several times in the Mimamsa Sutras.
Several other teachers are mentioned in both.  Sureshvaracharya the pupil
of Shankaracharya was the Mimamsaka Mandana Mishra.  Swami Vidyaranya in
his purvashrama wrote works on Mimamsa.  Appaya Dikshita is another
great name in Vedanta who also wrote works on Mimamsa.  Even today, the
Jagadgurus and their students are well versed in both.

As Vidyashankar as eloquently shown, he did not.

I don't know any other students of advaitism so I can't answer that.

My views on this and those of others have been covered in other posts.

Remembered by who?  Your memmory hasn't proven to be that reliable so far.
On the other hand, there are approximately 500,000 Hasidim alive today who
are followers of the Besht.  Do you think they value purity of the heart
more than Talmudic learning?

I didn't exactly disparage it.  I stated a fact.

As a matter of fact I don't.  We had a thread on it a while back.  In any
case we are talking about Tattva Vaishradi which is indisputably a work on
Yoga.  The genius of Vachaspati Mishra is he wrote works in several
darshans each of which became an authority in that darshan.  That's why he
has the title "sarvatantra svatantra".

If you say so.  You after all invented it.  Advaita Vedanta has different
criteria.

Because you don't understand its true nature.

Jiva = Brahman.  It's as simple as that.
