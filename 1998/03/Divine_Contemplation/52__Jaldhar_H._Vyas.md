Not true.  There are various controversies over the interpretation of the
constitution but the statement "U.S. laws are based upon the constitution"
is nevertheless true.  The various schools of Vedanta have many
differences but they can agree on a lot of things too.

That's because it is!

Do we "understand" why the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180
degrees?  It is actually a matter of convention and logically consistent
non-Euclidean geometries are possible.  Does this make everyday geometry
false?

The Vedas only claim to deal with two subjects.  Dharma in the
case of the Karmakanda, and Brahman in the case of the Jnanakanda.  These
are not subjects which can be learnt from any other source.  The words of
Shruti are the "first principles" from which Purva and Uttara Mimamsakas
derive the rest of their philosophy.  For Samkhya-Yoga on the other hand
true knowledge can be gained through Yogic insight and the Vedas are only
important because they are the record of great yogis.  They avoid the
problem of faith in Shruti but they have a new problem:  Why should anyone
believe a Yogi?  So it boils down to whether you have faith in words or
people.  It's still "irrational" faith.

What if you tried to learn geometry by swallowing a textbook?  That would
be counter-productive too I think :-)  It wouldn't affect the validity of
geometry any though.  In the same way the Vedas cannot be blamed for their
misuse.
