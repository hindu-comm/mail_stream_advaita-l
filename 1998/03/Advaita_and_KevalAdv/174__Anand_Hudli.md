  Welcome to the list.

   As far as I know, the word "kevala-advaita" is used by some
 northern schools of vaishnavism to refer to Shankara's advaita
 as distinguished from their own form of advaita, for example,
 Shuddha-advaita, dvaita-advaita, etc. I am not sure if the
 term "kevala-advaita" is taken as a proper way of describing
 Shankara's advaita by his followers. The only correct term for
 Shankara's school is also the most popular one - advaita (without
 any prefix) or advaita vedaanta. Actually, one could argue that
 since only advaita is explained in vedaanta, the terms advaita
 and vedaanta are synonyms. That is why even now the term "vedantin"
 is, by default, taken to mean a follower of Shankara's advaita
 vedaanta.
 Since most of the vaishnava schools do not agree with Shankara's
 advaita on a number of points, their terming of the latter's system
 as "kevala-advaita" may not be taken as a compliment. That is why I
 think the term advaita is appropriate, not kevala-advaita.

 The terms "maayaavaada", "maayaavaadii" etc, are for sure taken as
 derogatory when applied to Shankara's followers.  Shankara's
 philosophy is concerned with Brahman and should be called
 "brahma-vaada." But in explaining Brahman, an explanation of
 "maayaa" becomes inevitable. The Vaishnava schools have blown this
 out of proportion by saying that advaitins are only concerned with
 maayaa, and have termed them maayaavaadii's and the philosophy
 maayaavaada.
