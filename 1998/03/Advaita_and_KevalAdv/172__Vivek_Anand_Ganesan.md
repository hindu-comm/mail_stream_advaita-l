Namashkar,

   I was wondering if anoyone can tell me the meaning of
"kevalAdvaita".  I have seen this word used instead of "Advaita".  I
have also seen "ShankarAdvaita" though  this seems to be pretty rare.
Is "ShankarAdvaita" used in contradistinction to other forms of
Advaita like "VishhuddhAdvaita".

Thanks in advance for your replies,

Vivek.
