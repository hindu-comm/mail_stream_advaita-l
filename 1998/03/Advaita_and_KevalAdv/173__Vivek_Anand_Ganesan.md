   Thank you very much for your warm welcome.  I feel honored to be
amongst the followers of advaita.

   I gathered the following from the posting of Shree Ram Chandran :

a) Kevaladvaita is another name for the philosophy of advaita as
expounded by Adi Shankara.

  So, if kevalAdvaita is indeed the school of Sri Shankaracharya then,
what is the exact meaning of the word "Kevaladvaita"?

b) What I meant by "VishhuddhAdvaita" is in fact Shuddha-Advaita of
Sri Vallabha.

  I remember reading "VishhuddhAdvaita" as the school of Sri
Vallabhacharya in an introductory book of Indian Philosophy.  I
apologize if I have caused any confusion.
  The reason I referred to this school is to know if
Shankara referred to his philosophy as "Kevaladvaita" or is it a
post-shankaran nomenclature introduced to distinguish shankaran
philosophy from other kinds of "advaita" vedanta?

Thanks again, Sir, for your Greetings.

-Vivek.
