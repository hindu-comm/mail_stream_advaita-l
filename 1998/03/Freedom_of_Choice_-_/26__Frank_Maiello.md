Yes, these concepts (karma, Isvara, the Script, freedom from choice)
and all concepts like them, collectively represent merely components
of a philsophical strategy for the mind to utilize in order to
re-immerge itself back into its source.  As such, they have no
import *unto themselves*, and are therefore irrelevant in the face
of jnana, which is an attributeless dynamic.

Namaste.
