This is completely backwards.  It is the jiva which creates and performs
karma and Ishwar just impartially metes out the rewards and punishments
based on that karma.  This is all explained in the Brahmasutrabhasya.
There is no point in denying free will it doesn't buy Brahman anything and
_does_ exist for the Jiva.
