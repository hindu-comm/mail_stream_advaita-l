Very insightful point!  Whatever is seen, whatever appears, whatever seems
to exist or to be the case -- all this is something in Ishwara's script
(some say it arises spontaneously).  Even the belief in free will is
something in the script.  Years ago, I asked a Tibetan rinpoche (teacher)
about free will.  He said that we are forced to believe in free will.
