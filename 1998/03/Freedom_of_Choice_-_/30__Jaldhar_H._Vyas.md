So if it the utilitarian view which is to be taken what is the point of
denying free will which is not the experience of the vast majority of
people?  (I don't know any people who think their every action is
controlled by some invisible puppetmaster at any rate.)

My view is that denying free will buys one nothing and is
potentially quite harmful at the vyvaharic level.  At the Paramarthic
level Brahman cannot be impeded by any obstacle.  If that isn't freedom
the distinction is overly subtle.

I see there is a long thread on free will which I am still reading
through but one thing that I noticed was the issue of Bhakti.  One cannot
wriggle out of free will by invoking God either as the essence of Bhakti
is the surrender or tyaga of actions, words, and thoughts to Bhagawan.
One cannot honestly offer that which belongs to another.
