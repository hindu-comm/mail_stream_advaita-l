Thanks for a nice post.

In my view, certainly, freedom *from choice* is the only thing. We do
                                     ------
not have a choice. We only "think" we have a choice. As TMP Mahadevan's
writing (which I admire) says "moksha is freedom from individuality;
moksha is not freedom for the individual.".

You say as part of the post above ".... As such, there is no karma made
or created by individual jiva....". I look at this from two points of
view.

I see fully that the karma theory falls apart at dawning of ultimate
knowledge. But, as long as the individual jeeva concept is there, karma
concept goes along with it. What I am saying is "we cannot say, there
is a jeeva, but there is no karma made or created,". Karma concept
rightly dies when the ego is dissolved, so that all karma (fruits of
action) go to Ishwara. But, then when the ego is not there, jeeva has
died as well (may not be physically, but mentally). At that stage, is
it necessary to say anything, even "aham brahmAsmi" ?

I come back to that sentence again ".... As such, there is no karma made
or created by individual jiva....". It is so, if we see ourselves as
followers of the script of Ishwara. But is it not also in Ishwara's
script that we see ourselves as individual jeevas ? We do not have a
choice except to follow the script.
