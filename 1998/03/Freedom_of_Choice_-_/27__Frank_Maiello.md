No, jiva represents the so-called 'reincarnating ego.'  Atman is
its substratum or source (which is the Self), synonymous with brahman.

Not in the way it's customarily considered.  It's as real as any other
concept in space-time, thus it infinitesimally applies to the Self.
As far as being a definitive attribute, integral to the essential
reality of Self, it's meaningless.

Namaste.
