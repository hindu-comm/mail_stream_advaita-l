By Jiva, I think you mean the Self.
If so :
I thought the shruti said that the Self, which is the same as Brahman,
is not affected by any change and is constant (for want of a better
word!). Isn't it that : 1. Karma is only linked to the ego, body and
mind combination. 2. Once we've (???) 'linked' with the Self or to
phrase it better, become one with Brahman, there cannot be any Karma.

So does the freewill concept apply to the Self?
