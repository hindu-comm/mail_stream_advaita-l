Namaste. And pardon my intrusion into the discussion.

I read somewhere (I cannot recall the source right now) that the reason
for stating Om Shantih three times is to overcome obstacles from three
sources: namely, (1) Adhi Atmikam, (2) Adhi bhoutikam, (3) Adhi daivikam.
Adhi Atmikam refers to obstacles due to inertia, laziness, inattentiveness
etc. Adhi bhoutikam refers to obstacles from physical incapacitance etc.
Adhi daivikam refers to obstacles from Gods due to lightening, floods etc.
I read this in the context of interpreting and explanation of "Om bhadram
karNebhi shruNuyAma devAh...". I cannot recall the source of this
interpretation, but can look for it if required.

p.s. I just saw the post by Swami Vishwarupananda on the same topic with
similar explanation.
