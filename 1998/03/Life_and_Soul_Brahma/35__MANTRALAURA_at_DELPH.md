sarvebhyo namaH,

  OM shaantiH shaantiH shaantiH

  Brahman means OM, OM means Brahman;
shaantiH means peace; the three repetitions
are for destroying the three kinds of
obstacles to the acquisition of knowledge,
viz the physical, the natural, and the
supernatural. (taittiriiyopaniShad)

------

  . . . the Brahman to be inquired into here
is a pre-existing entity; and It is not
dependent on human effort, since It is
eternally present. . .

  "The root 'bR^iMh' means growth, and the suffix
'man', added to it, signifies an absence of
limitation (in expanse)."

  . . . That omniscient and omnipotent source
must be Brahman from which occur the birth,
continuance, and dissolution of this universe
that is manifested through name and form, that
is associated with diverse agents and experiences,
that provides the support for actions and results,
having well-regulated space, time, and causation,
and that defies all thoughts about the real nature
of its creation. . .

  "Seek to know that from which all these beings
take birth, that by which they live after being
born, that towards which they proceed and into
which they merge; that is Brahman" (Tai. III. i)

OM shaantiH shaantiH shaantiH

dhanyavaadaH,
