namaskaaraM Ravi,
  I am grateful for the comments and words provided
by Swami Vishvarupananda and Gummuluru Murthy
regarding the three repetitions of "shaantiH". I would
also like to continue with my train of thought, since
it is in line with the words they provided. Please
understand that I am only adding to what they say
from what I have found in various upaniShads and
books on gaayatrii.

 adhyatimika means relating to the Soul or
 the Supreme Spirit.

 adhibhautika comes from adhi-bhuuta meaning
 the spiritual or fine substratum of material
 or gross objects; the all-penetrating influence
 of the Supreme Spirit; nature.
 bhautika by itself means anything elemental or
 material.

 adhidaivika means spiritual.

 For the second "shaantiH" - Once the knowledge
has been heard and seen, even though it might
not be understood in the beginning, the meanings
of the statements by the teacher will unfold and
meanings of the words and syllables of the mantras
will be understood. It is then that "reflection"
on what has been heard and seen will take place.
An inquiry on this knowledge will be sought by
the seeker, questions will arise, and tattva-
viveka (discrimination of the truth) will begin.
If the answers from the teacher are supported
by the inspired scriptures (the Vedas, upaniShads,
prakaaraNa texts), then the knowledge that has
been received is worthy of being reflected on.
It is my understanding from the two scriptures
quoted from in taittiriiya-upaniShad that this
is what we are asking for: 1) for guidance to
a teacher/guru/swaami who speaks of the knowledge
of the Vedas, and our willingness to hear what
he has to say; 2) for an understanding, after
careful reflection on the knowledge we hear of
and see from our teacher and a study of the
materials related to the Vedas - these things
leading to knowledge of Brahman-Atman.

(To be continued tomorrow . . . )

OM shaantiH shaantiH shaantiH

dhanyavaadaH,
  Mantralaura
