Supernatural, natural and bodily is translated from
adhidaivika shanti, adhibhautika shanti and adhyatimika shanti.
It is commonly translated as peace from the obstacles arising through the
three forces, viz. supernatural forces, such as devas, natual forces and our
own.
Swami Vimalananda of Ramakrishna Math, e.g., expresses it thus: "Let there
be peace in me, in my environment and in the forces that act on me."
I thus do not think it has to do with sthula sukshma and karana.
Om Om Om
