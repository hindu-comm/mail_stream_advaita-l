namaskAram

I think I did not state the question correctly. I am sorry for that.
My question is what is the basis for your interpretation of

OM shaantiH shaantiH shaantiH

You post does not explain that. Does the words "bodily, natural and
supernatural" correspond to the the three planes gross (stUla), subtle
(sUkshma) and Causal (kAraNa)?

Thanks
