The second point is the standpoint of the witness, or the result of inquiry
or atma vichara.  This standpoint is:
  -able to see thoughts and desires and all vrittis arising spontaneously,
        including that of "it's my will."
  -unable to see or detect a true entity whose will it is.

I equate ego as the ahamkara or "I-notion."  Identification, to me, is the
belief of myself that I am something, an "X" -- that "X" can be one of the
usual levels given in Vedanta: the body, mind, intellect, one of the
panchakosas, etc.  And using Western concepts I would say that the "X" is
usually with a set of memories or beliefs or values (I am my memories, my
beliefs, my values).  In Truth, I am not any kind of "X" at all.  Instead,
I Am.  (Same for you and all of us, dear Charles!)  But there are times we
believe we are something.  With this belief comes the I-notion and
identification (I'd say these two, ego and identification, come and go at
the same time.)

Usually the teachers who stress this point (the no free will point) aver
that their path is a pathless path - no practices needed, no actions will
result in liberation, etc.  Some authority for this is taken from
Nisargadatta's phrase "Understanding is all."

There's a huge difference - arguing in this Advaita mailing list about the
existence of free will, as is done in Philosophy 101 classes and graduate
schools throughout the U.S., doesn't seem to me to be harmful.  But the
*harm* I am referring to is done when a spiritual teacher is set up in
front of a room filled with respectful, often desparate, credulous devotees
hanging on every word.  When the no-free-will point is uttered in *that
context*, it is quite another matter altogether.  Even the people present
in the room are different.  I can give you several examples from teachers
(mostly Western, not in the orthodox Vedantic tradition).

I'm not sure what you're asking here.  Greg's actions aren't Greg.  They
aren't apart from Greg either.  According to Vedanta, who *I really* am
(despite many maya-influenced beliefs to the contrary!) is not Greg or the
actions.  Greg and Greg's actions occur in *me*.  They are made of
awareness only.  Same for you and everyone else.

Yes, I feel the heat, and must say that it's more pleasant discussing this
when there is less heat.  I'm still not sure of your beliefs on free will.
As you probably know, free will is  not only a religious topic, it's still
a respectable subject of discussion in academia as well.

Above, you said it's harmful, so how could I responsibly discuss it on this
list, so maybe you now mean discussing it privately...  I feel now  that if
there's even the shadow of a possibility of harm, I won't discuss it any
more on the list.  I'm very glad to discuss it off-list, but this is the
last Advaita-list message I will post containing arguments against the
existence of free will.
