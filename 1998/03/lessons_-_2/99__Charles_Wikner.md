The larger understanding encompasses the lesser: we agree on that.
How do these circles become separate points in the next sentences:

The first "point" seems to be the familiar ego; the second sounds
like a demonic divorce of sattva from rajas and tamas.  Would you
please describe or illustrate that second "point".

Okay, but I am not happy with the word `teaching'.  A teaching
is systematic and comprehensive, whereas you are offering a
rather singular belief.  But lets not quibble over terminology.

Okay.

This is not a variety show but a forum for the discussion of
Advaita Vedanta.  Free will is an aspect of the Advaita path;
the denial of free will is not.  I'm being pedantic: skip it.

The attractiveness of the belief is clear, but it looks like a trap.

Please explain the last phrase: I equate identification with ego;
what do you understand by ego in your statement?

I can understand that: it doesn't fit on any useful path.

That's the ego, the first of your reference points.

As a logical consequence.

Your actions belie your words: if you agree that it is dangerous
(and have seen that it can be "received with profound confusion"),
how are you able to continue to disseminate that belief on this list
(where you cannot see the resultant harm)?

That was a serious question (not a charge): how (not why).
Are you viewing (what others see as) Greg's actions as somehow
separate from Greg himself?  This would seem to accord with
your two "reference points" given above.  Do please explain.

Dear Greg, in the past I have expended much heat in defending free
will, but at last a little light is beginning to shine through.
The situation is rather like seeing pornographic magazines in a
bookshop: there is an attraction for it, but also a vague knowledge
that it would be wrong to indulge.  So long as the knowledge remains
vague, it is only heat (blind dogma) that keeps one away from it;
but as the knowledge becomes clearer, so that one can express it
in one's own words, then the heat turns to light and one is free of
even the attraction.

Returning to the topic of free will, it is becoming clear that, in
general, the diffence is merely terminological, but nonetheless one
that should be resolved for clarity of communication.  However, the
position that you seem to be taking on free will really is harmful,
to you as well as others, and I would welcome discussing it further.

Regards, Charles.
