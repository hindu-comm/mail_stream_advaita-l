In our shastras a code of conduct is prescribed.  It is not uniform, there
are variations for times, places, castes, gender, and stages of life.
Plus there are certain things where we are given a choice of actions.  In
each case there is a right and wrong way.  It is human beings which have
the power to make that choice.  In a sense putting the dog in the same
position as your sister is a false comparison.  The dog was not going to
see the acharya, it was just moving around a prisoner of its own animal
impulses.  Your sister had the choice to do or not do and the intellect to
comprehend it.  This makes us a much higher being than the dog even if she
couldn't enter.

As another post has pointed out religion provides a discipline and it is
not realistic to assume it will always coincide with ones own wishes.

There is nothing wrong in wondering why people do things.  The best way
to know is to ask them.  I don't know exactly what you mean by tirtham.
Either we don't have this ceremony or it is called by some different name.
But if it is some kind of blessing than that may be why the paramacharya
excluded the widow.  According to our shastras a widow is amangala and
should not be involved in blessings.  I don't think that means she should
be excluded altogether because on the contrary some authorities say a
widow should spend all her time in religious activity.  Several widows
(and widowers) are invited to my wedding and I see nothing wrong with them
taking part but they will not be involved in the vidhis etc.

So why did the paramacharya adopt a stricter attitude than was required.
The answer I think is that the shastras ony pescribe the minimum.  Those
who love dharma try and go beyond the minimum.  For instance on Ekadashi
days there is a fast.  But that is interpreted to mean one should eat only
one meal.  Like some people I don't eat at all.  This is a higher form of
the vrat which I do because I like it and am strong enough to do it but I
could not condemn someone who just did it the normal way.  They are
fulfilling their duty.  In the same way if the present acharya isn't as
stringent in this case as the previous one it doesn't neccessarily mean he
cares less or anything.  Maybe the next one will again be more stringent.

Hope this answers the question.
