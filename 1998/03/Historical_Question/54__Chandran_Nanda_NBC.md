This is a historical question :

>From what I see and hear, of the six astika schools of Hindu philosophy,
Vedanta reigns supreme in current India. Yoga seems to be quite a
popular school with a considerable following of it's own. But are the
other four schools - Samkhya, Nyaya, Vaiseshika and Purva Miimamsaa,
practiced anywhere?

Ironically with the globalisation et al, which India is currently
undergoing, the Carvakas seem to be having the last laugh!
