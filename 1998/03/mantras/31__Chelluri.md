                                            Om

Namaste!

I know there are five mantras dedicated to the five bhutas (panchabhutas)

Prithvu  -  (Earth)     Agni  (Fire)   Apa  (Water)    Vayu  (Air)  Akasam
(Ether)

I have the mantras for Prithvi and Agni and can't find remaining 3 (Apa, Vayu
and Akasa).   If you know these three mantras or if you know a source, please
post it.

It will be of great help!      Thanks.
