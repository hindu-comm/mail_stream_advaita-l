sarvebhyo namaH,
  Here are shloka(s) nineteen and twenty
of Continuous Garland of Sacred Knowledge:

  ghaTakuDyaadikaM sarvam.h

  "(Just as) a pot, wall plaster, and
other such things (effects) are all
nothing but clay (cause), likewise all
creation is nothing but Brahman. Thus
is the declaration of the complete
knowledge of the Veda (UpaniShads)."(19)

  brahma satyaM jaganmithyaa
jiivo brahmaiva naparaH |
   anena vedyaM sachChaastram.h
iti vedaantaDiNDimaH || 20 ||

  "Brahman is the Truth, the creation
is false, and the individual is indeed
Brahman, (alone) none other. The One to
be known, Who has no superior, is the
genuine teaching (well-known to the sages).
Thus is the declaration of the complete
knowledge of the Veda (UpaniShads)." (20)
