PraNAms.

I am grateful to Swami Vishvarupananda for his response. I am not
advocating that the human does not make any effort. If my post came
up that way, I did not mean that. May be, I did not put sufficient
introductory sentences to my post. I took my post as a continuing
discussion for the past one and half years or so on the List where
this topic has been repeatedly discussed. The archives would show
that I have repeatedly stated that the human has to work and I
referred many times to Isha upanishhad statement "... kurvann eva
iha karmANi..", that the jeeva has to do the work (effort) and do
the work. One cannot escape from that.

Swami Vishvarupananda and I differ in the interpretation of what is
called *human* effort. What the swamiji calls *human* effort, I call
that effort is put in (by the jeeva) only by divine grace. I am saying
that the human cannot and should not take credit for it. What is the
*human effort* due to ? I suggest that it is by bhagavadkr^pa.

The swamiji did not address the two rhetorical alternatives that I
suggested. Ishwara does not require *human* effort to supplement His
blessings. Nor, if Ishwara blesses otherwise, the so-called "human effort"
does not make a difference.

In the Swamiji's analogy, who suggests to the human to open the tab ?
I say it is only divine blessing. The viveka the human has is a result of
divine blessing and nothing else.

Swamiji says "... till the ego surrenders.". Exactly. But the
ego-surrenderance would not be there as long as the human thinks he/she is
making an effort to better him/herself. Shri RamaNa's analogy which I
quoted is a very apt one here. Why does a passenger on a train wish to
carry the load on the head rather than surrendering it for the train to
carry ?

I am not attributing Shri Shankara says anything about human effort here.
I am interpreting "...aham bhAvodayAbhAvo..." to say that the human should
not have even the *thinking* of the egoistic I and that is the culmination
of knowledge. The human should not even be conscious that he/she is not
having the thinking of the egoistic I. That feeling should not even arise
in the mind and that is the culmination of knowledge. I submit that when
the human is thinking that he/she is putting an effort, the egoistic I is
very much present. I referred to Shri Shankara's Viveka ChuDAmaNi verse in
that context.

I did not say anywhere in my post the above sentence. I would request the
Swamiji to show clearly where I made that particular statement in my post.
I think the Swamiji is mis-reading my post.

I repeat the statement above again. I think the Swamiji is mis-reading my
statement. I have never said effort is not needed nor suggested to use
that as an excuse for not making effort. I said the word "human effort"
does not have meaning and it is all bhagadkr^pa. I am saying "don't take
credit for the effort, as the devAs did in the allegory". I would ask the
Swamiji to show the specific statement in my post where what he attributed
to me was said.

I did not say anything about effortlessness., only on taking credit for
the effort. I suspect the Swamiji may have another objective in mind in
making the above statement, rather than to respond to what I posted.

This is another topic altogether. We clearly have a "choice" here.
We can wallow in the vyavahArika, talking of human effort all the time,
rejoice at the "successes" of the so-called human effort

OR

Make that extra step required to reach that paramArthika level. The extra
step is not hard to make. But, in order for us to be qualified to make
that extra step, the first condition is give up the concept of *human*
effort.
