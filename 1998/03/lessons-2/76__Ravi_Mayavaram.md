Divine grace is the only thing which makes everything happens. It is
ever available. But one has to put _effort_ to receive it. I think
that vairAgyam will not come in to being automatically. One has to
cultivate it. I am not saying that it is impossible for God to confer
someone with vairAgyam  just like that. SHE can do anything.  But SHE
will not do it arbitrarily because then one can accuse of partiality.
God is beyond such things. HER grace is ever available, yet we have to
learn through effort to receive it.

Swami Vishvarupananda's reply to this was very nice and useful.  In
Tripura Rahasya, I learnt the power of repeated mental associations.
Habits, attachment and bondage, happens through such repeated mental
associations. To reverse the trend one has to cultivate dispassion
through nitya-anitya vastu vivekam and through  prayer. In fact I
recently read that one has to struggle and stay away from the bad
habits (like smoking) for 10 years or so, escape from its clutches.
Effort required cannot be under estimated.
