                                          Sri Devi

Thanks Murty Garu.  You did a good job.  Ravi is also right Human effort is
needed not supplement Gods Grace but to....  I dont know Why

Panjali says "Essswara Pranidhaanaawaa"
Sharanam Eeeswara!  You take it.
Pranidhaanam means bhakti.

What I understood is give the credit to Devi and one is relieved if one has
still Aham.

Shubham                                                      Nagy
