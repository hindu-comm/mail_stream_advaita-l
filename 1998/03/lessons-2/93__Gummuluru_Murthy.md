Public apology

I would like to publicly apologize to Swami Vishvarupananda for my
rather incisive post (my previous one in this thread) where I have
used harsher language than what should have been. It was clearly a
case where the ego has taken over. My apologies for that. It was
bothering me for the past two days and hopefully my mind can let
go of that thought.

Regards
Gummuluru Murthy

When all the desires that dwell in the heart fall away, then the mortal
becomes immortal, and attains Brahman even here.
