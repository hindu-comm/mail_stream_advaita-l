I'm pretty sure it is not near Ahmedabad if it is the city of that name in
Gujarat you are referring to.  Although many Gujaratis are Shaktas, the
major mandir of Mataji in Gujarat, Ambaji, is actually just accross the
border in Rajasthan.  The only other mandir I can think off that could
claim to be a pitha is Bahucharaji but this is not near Ahmedabad.  Lastly
there is a place called Bhuvaneshwari pitha in Gondal which is a nice
place (I wear a medallion of Bhuvaneshwari Mata on my mala) but
unfortunately does not have a legitimate claim to being a pitha.
