Not according to all Shruti.  In the Gaudapada Karika of the Mandukya
Upanishad (es. Valli IV) there are very profound arguments that creation is
impossible, that it never really happens.  For creation to really take
place, then there must be a real causal agent and a real effect.
Everything that happens at the level of cause-and-effect is within Maya, so
Brahman as nirguna is not the causal agent.  Therefore,  any causal agent
is an illusory agent.  So with the many theories of causation in Vedanta,
why is one any better than another, other than that it resonates with you?
