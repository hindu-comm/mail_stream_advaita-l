Namashkar,

     I thank Shree Anand Hudli and Shree Ram Chandran for their
explanations for my previous question.

   On an allied note, I would like to know the meaning of the word
"Shankara".  I have heard it used as one of the names of Lord Shiva.
Is there a philosophical meaning for this word?  I have also seen it
written as "Shamkara".  Is this proper?

Thank you,
-Vivek.

  "I am without support, but indeed I
am (of the nature of ) supporting all
(everyone, everything). I am (of the
nature of ) One who knows the identity
of Brahman and Aatmaan, the Supreme
Soul. I am indeed That. I am imperishable."

  "I am free from the three-fold miseries
(resulting from the individual, the
elemental, and the divine sources),
I am witnessing three bodies (gross,
subtle, and causal). I am witnessing
three states (waking, dream, and deep
sleep), moreover, I am indeed That.
I am imperishable." (16)
