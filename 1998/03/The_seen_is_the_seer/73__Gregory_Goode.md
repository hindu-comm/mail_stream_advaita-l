Your direct experience is of colors, and forms, sounds, etc.  Which are all
Brahman.  Nothing in direct experience says that "this is in my
consciousness," or "this was present before I saw it."  Those are concepts
and theories that come on top of what is experienced.

Direct experience is mediated by the intellect.  Have you seen the books of
Douglas Harding?  They would answer all your questions, for he, somewhat
uniquely, explains non-dualism thru perception and sensation.  Lots of
examples, exercises, etc.

Consciousness/Brahman is all there is, so nothing can be outside it.
Nothing is other than it.  The seeing, the seer and the seen are illusory
objects and actions that seem to take place, but this must be inside
consciousness.  The "person" is inside consciousness.  Consciousness is not
inside the person.
