Yes.  In fact my last post should have been off-list.  Apologies.

I see no harm in *discussing* it (how it arises, its nature and
effects) -- in fact I have just posted such a discussion to the
list (Re: Screeching Squirrels) -- but merely asserting it as an
unqualified fact does have the potential to influence others
negatively.

I am grateful that you are willing to continue the discussion, and
shall respond to the rest of your post privately.

Regards, Charles.
