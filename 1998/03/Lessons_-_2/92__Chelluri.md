                                          Namo Naga Nandini

When I was a young boy a well known "GhanapaTHi" used to come to our house and
recite a "Panasa" or two in our home shrine.   I got interested and requested
him whether I can record on my newly acquired Recorder.

He told me that Veda is not for entertainment.   If he does it for money he
will loose his vakshuddi.
