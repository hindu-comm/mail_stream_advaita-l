I don't think the finer understanding exlcudes the smaller circle of free
will.  There is a reference point according to which there are strong
experiences of freedom of will.  There is also a reference point according
to which these experiences are understood in a way that doesn't necessitate
or imply free will.

To say that this is not a teaching for everyone is not to say that it is an
elitist view.  No teaching will resonate with everyone, no teaching is
equally useful for everyone.  Hence the variety of teachings.  With respect
to this one teaching on free will, I have seen this teaching be received by
people who then experienced profound, liberating shifts away from
identification with the ego.  With other people, I have seen the teaching
recieved with profound confusion.  People who, as Swami has said, heard
this while they were on a path.  Hearing this teaching, they become
confused and start to try to work this teaching into their world view.
They FEEL like they are the do-ers, they FEEL the activity of a will, but
this conflicts with the teaching from a teacher they respect.  So there's
cognitive dissonance.  So in this, I agree most respectfully with the
Swami, who said,

Any judgment has some measure of ego.  (Even if this is a judgment, it does
too!)

That's right, nothing except Truth Itself is universally true!
