It's not mine Greg! I actually lifted it out of Arvind Sharma's,
"Philosophy of Religion : A Buddhist Perspective".

The books is deeply analytical, complex and requires intense
concentration as it brings forth various arguments for and against God
from various sources - Buddhist, Vedic, Christian etc. After spending 6
hours or so on it, I've just completed 20 odd pages! To add to this the
book has not been edited properly - bad phrasing and grammer on an
already complex subject makes it murder on the reader!
