This is a fascinating idea!  God the only cause, everything in
phenomenality an effect!  This is similar to a theory of causality in the
Western philosophy of mind called "epiphenomenalism," in which
consciousness is a by-product of physiology, but has no causal efficacy at
all.

If there has to be a notion of causality at all, I think this suggestion of
yours is one of the best yet!!!
