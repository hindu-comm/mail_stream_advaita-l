A difference between these comes in action only when there is free will.

Dear Greg, aren't you contradicting yourself here? You are talking about the
believe of no free will having an effect on the actions of a person. But
that effect can be there only, if the person does have the freedom of
choice. So you are admiting that freedom.

jiva has no choice, but that he meant, we should surrender  the ego to God.
If he wanted to say there is no thing as free will on the vyavaharika level,
he could not have said "act as though you do". If he tells us to act in a
certain way, that presupposes that we have a choice in how we want to act.
If there was no such freedom with the jiva, no spiritual teacher would tell
us what we should do or not. If everything was predestined, such talk would
be like, say, telling a flower to grow in a different direction. It has no
power over the direction it grows, no choice, so why would we tell it.

That is wonderful. When the thought of no free will gives you the ability to
surrender to God's will, that is the greatest thing that can happen to you.
However I would say, you are again not really talking of nonexistence of
choice.
Obviously the believe in it has and an effect on you, i.e. believing in this
you started to move in a certain way. Imho, if you had no choice, there
should not have been any effect.
I'm not saying, as Gummuluruji pointed out, that we should take credit for
our actions. But it is dangerous (for most) to say, I have no choice. Unless
one is already a great devotee and set firmly on the path, one will use this
as an excuse to follow the dictates of the mind.

>There is no reason that it would go

Yes, but again this is so, because we have a choice. If there was no choice,
then what difference would it make if one believes or does not believe in
it.

>Isn't this why texts

But Greg, Mandukya Up. does not say there is no free will.

Greetings and Om,
