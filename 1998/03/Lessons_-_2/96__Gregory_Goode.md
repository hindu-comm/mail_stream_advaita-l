Beliefs can occur without the will acting as an agent.  After all, who
chooses their beliefs?  And who hasn't had a belief they'd rather not have?
 (E.g., the belief a wife has upon seeing lipstick on her husband's
collar...)  Beliefs can occur or not occur, and the will, even if it were
present in other vrittis, need not be present in these cases of belief.

No contradiction, and no freedom either!  Not at all!  Beliefs don't either
appear or disappear because of will.  They come and go, completely
unbidden.  But this doesn't mean that beliefs can't have consequences (we
aren't discussing theories of causation here, just free will).  Beliefs can
have causes and effects.   If billiard balls on the billiard table can have
causal efficacy, if a Pavlovian experimentor can attribute causation to the
sound of the bell (the effect being the animal's salivation), then beliefs
can be said to have effects too.  Why, they can even have causes.
Mahavakyas and a sage's pointers to the Self can jar a person's belief
systems, causing a weakening of the identification with the panchacosas,
etc.

I'm not arguing (right here, at least) that there's no causation, I'm just
saying that a will is not part of the causal chain.  As for flowers, there
have been experiments that show that plants CAN be affected by being talked
to, cared for, played music to, etc.  They grow larger, lusher, don't die
as quickly.

I agree with this!  Not a teaching for everyone!  Charles Wikner said
something similar I believe, in one of his recent postings on this topic.

Just so.  In fact, I've heard that Hindi (maybe Sanskrit too) doesn't even
have a word for "free will."

But the Mandukya Up. gives convincing arguments that there is no causation.
 And if there is no causation, then there can't be free will.  For
everything is the whirling of the firebrand, nothing in phenomenality
having power over anything else.  Just like nothing in a movie really
causes anything, everything emanates from the film itself.  That's all I
meant by mentioning that Upanishad.

One teacher I heard say that from the standpoint of the jiva, everything is
determined (because the jiva doesn't choose its thoughts).  From the
standpoint of absolute consciousness, everything is freedom Itself.

Om!!
