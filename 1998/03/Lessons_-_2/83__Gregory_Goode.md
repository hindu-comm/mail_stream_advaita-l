OM!

I agree with Swami that in the realm of Brahman, nonduality, that none of
these concepts or entities exists.  But the nonexistence of free will can
be experienced on the vyavaharika level as well.  There are many bhaktas in
every religion who see everything that happens as totally ordained by God.
Even their thoughts.  Not to mention, there are the well-respected Western
theories of determinism and compatibilism that, when  can give the
experience of everything happening via some causal process, no freedom
anywhere.
