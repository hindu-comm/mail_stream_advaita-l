As much faith and interest I have the conduct prescribed by our shastras I
have to admit it is of no help in acheiving Moksha.  That is simply not
the Advaita view.  At best it can help cultivate the qualities you mention
but that's it.   They are still very important because most people will
fall short of the mark Shankaracharya sets.

Radhakrishnan was not a Buddhist so his interpretations are suspect to
begin with but it is clear that for Buddhists Dharma meant something other
than what it does for us.
