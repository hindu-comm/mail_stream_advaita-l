Namaste, and thanks for putting this in perspective.

The question which I asked is in the realm of intellect (as I mentioned in
another post in the same thread) and the question still need to be answered:
whose is this mAyA ? The purpose of my original post is to express doubt
on the thinking that mAyA is associated with Brahman.

As per my understanding:

Brahman is in the plane of paramArtha, pervades all and everywhere, and
is changeless. Brahman does not require any explanation and has no use for
mAyA.

Ishwara is in the plane of vyavahArika, controls mAyA, does not require
any explanation and has no use for mAyA.

Jeeva sees the whole jagat, is fully entangled in mAyA, seeks explanations
for all the perceptions of the mind. Thus, it seems to me that the locus
of mAyA is with the jeeva in its entanglements. If jeeva were free from
the ego, the whole entanglement would vanish and mAyA dissolves. If
Brahman were an entity, it would laugh off at the predicaments the jeeva
puts itself in.
