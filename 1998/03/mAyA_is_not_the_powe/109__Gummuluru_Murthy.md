Namaste.  The following is my understanding.

Brahman is all powerful in vyavahArika explanation of Brahman. But, in
paramArtha understanding, there is no need of a powerful entity, and it is
this understanding we are striving for.

That, in my view, is a very good point. The answer I can give is: in
order to try to explain what we perceive, we need Ishwara, mAyA and
other concepts. Further, we need Ishwara for the dissolution of our ego.
It is in this context, I see a difference in emphasis in Shri RamaNa's
teachings and Shri Shankara's teachings. Both of them recognized what they
see around to be unreal. Shri RamaNa felt that there is no need to worry
or explain about unreal matters. Shri RamaNa's teaching objective is to
realize and stay in Brahman. Shri Shankara saw the unreality of the jagat,
but still tried to develop a model for the explanation of the perceived
things, even though knowing them to be unreal. These intellectual
discussions (like the present topic) are of intellectual curiosity only
and I think Shri RamaNa certainly would not approve of the discussion.
