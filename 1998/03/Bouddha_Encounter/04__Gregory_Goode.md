If you ever go back, let me know, I'll go with you...

Yes, in fact ANYTHING that is said is from the intellect.  What else, or
more, or less would you expect....?

Remember the tale told my Sri Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi and others about
spiritual concepts and practices being nothing more than a thorn, used to
remove another thorn from the flesh.  When the thorn is removed from the
flesh, then both thorns are thrown away.

Even if everything does evaporate at the end, as in pralaya or the
dissolution of the universe, there will be consciousness.  Otherwise, how
is dissolution known?
