Quite true. While the Buddha did mention shunyata as one of the three
paths leading to Nirvana, he never elaborated it to the degree as was
done by Nagarjuna. Infact, the Buddha was dead set against any such
speculative theories. So the validity of Nagarjuna's interpretation of
Buddha's shunyata is very much in question.

And Jaladhar, if you can condemn Radhakrishnan as not being eligible to
present a correct picture of Buddha's teachings as he's not a Bouddha,
neither should you be so forthcoming!:-)
