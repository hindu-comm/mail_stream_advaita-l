Nanda asks:

>Can it be positively said that there cannot be nothing
>at the end?

One reason to answer yes is that it is not intelligible to speak of either
an absolute end or absolute nothingness.   You can't, as the monk
apparently tired to do, go from the dissolution of a plastic chair to the
dissolution of everything absolutely.  The dissolution of the chair is
intelligible
because its nothingness is relative to a somethingness (the empty floor,
for instance).  Ultimate
nothingness is unintelligible.  The same reasoning applies to an absolute
end.
