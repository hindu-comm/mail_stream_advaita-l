        Individuality (and the experience of it) is something more than
what arises from a belief in free will.  It is knowledge itself. How do
you explain the fact that two people react in very different ways in the
same situation.  You have to admit that they *are different beings* and
this is not something related to their will but more to their
conditioning.

        Free will is really a matter of choice that is present (goes with
the individual), rather
than of "making something new".  It is not too difficult to take the view
that nothing "new" is ever created (in the sense that the knowledge of it
didnot exist in some form).  However, even that view doesn't deny the freedom
of choice that an individual has. Let me state it this way.  The knowledge
of individuality is inherent and has nothing to do with a belief system
but more to do with the way the thing is structured.  Along with this
comes the knowledge of choice and thence free will.  I really don't see
how you can deny that.
