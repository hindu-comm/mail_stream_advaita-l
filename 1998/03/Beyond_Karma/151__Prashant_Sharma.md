        I accept this fully.

        I believe though, that this surrender is not an act of will at
all.  Which is why it is so hard to surrender.

        I think of this act in the following way.  We are able to prepare
ourselves to sleep by our desire to sleep but that doesnot guarantee us
deep sleep all through.  So deep sleep is not something that happens because
of our desire to sleep but quite independently, although it does
seem to "us" to have been caused by this desire. Likewise "we" are not able to
stop thoughts from arising. It is a natural process that can be triggered
off by meditation.  But while we are in the process of meditation, there
is an "I" that is meditating.  When it disappears that is the peak.  To
say that the "I" caused such a state is a misstatement because the "I"
always wants to continue, why would it itself want to disappear?

        I accept this fully. Each of the activities mentioned above is in
the realm of "mAyA" and so there is an "I" which does these things.

Sincerely,

Prashant.
