namaskAraM

The best way to destroy the sins is to chant the name of God. I read a
powerful advice in sha.nkara's bhaashhya on lalitaa trishatii (for the
name hatyAdipApashamanI). shrI sha.nkara states that very chanting of
the name hari will destroy the sins. It is not even a question of
faith. Even if you do not believe that fire will burn, believe me ;-)
it will burn. Such is the power of the Lord's name.
