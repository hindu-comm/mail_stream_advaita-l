The Vedas proclaim a dual path, that of karma and that of jnana.  Most
people are concerned with the first path and for those people various
actions and prohibitions are prescribed.  There is nothing wrong with
people performing those actions out of a desire for fame, wealth, children
etc. but even the Purva Mimamsakas recognized that it is better to do them
without desire, out of a sense of duty only.  Most of the other schools of
Vedanta also agree with this.

Shankaracharya goes one step further and denies _any_ kind of karma no
matter how high the motive can lead to Moksha.  In the Bhagavata Purana we
read of how because of his fondness for only little deer, King Bharat was
born again and again.  So Shankaracharya says full vairagya is the only way.
As you say, a person no matter how good his intentions is no better of
than a criminal without that detachment.
