just on the lighter side -

Right now my wife is worried about my not downsizing!  She has determined
to worry about not only where my next meal is comming but with how much
fat.

That may provide one solution to my immediate problem - but I do not know
if that works.  Knowing my wife, she will try to follow me to insure that
no fat meal goes into my stomach - swaami or no-swaami. And everybody knows
that things donot not taste as good without fat!

Nagy I will become a swaami if you guarentee lot of followers.  I am sure
there must be many out there who are really desperate and are in need of a
new swaami.
But I am not taking any chances - I am preparing the list of the places
where I would like to have meetings so that I donot have to worry about it
later.
