Namaste.

I think I am not on solid ground in my interpretation of mumukshutvam
as a *general* desire to attain moksha, which any vedanta student would
have. Shri Govindarajan interprets this as the *intense* desire for
moksha. I agree that Shri Govindarajan's interpretation may be closer to
what Shri Shankara interprets in BrahmasutrabhAshhya-1,and the early
verses of Viveka ChuDAmaNi.

I am not sure of desire for moksha overriding vairAgya though. I thought
it would be the other way round: moksha overriding vairAgya is in bhakti
sampradAya, while in advaita, vairAgya overrides desire for moksha
also, it is complete oudAsInya and nirliptata.

Relevant to the present discussion, in bhakti sampradAya, an aspirant
considers him/herself to be an ajnAni and surrenders him/herself before
the personal God. Venkateshwara suprabhAtam says "ajnAninA mayA doshhAn
asheshhAn vihitAn hare, kshamassatvam, kshamassatvam sheshhashaila
shikhAmaNe.".  My understanding of advaita is that advaita takes us
beyond this step.
