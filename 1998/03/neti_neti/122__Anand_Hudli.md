    Whatever may be the motive(s), they may be lumped in ajnaana
    again! Such a person is more deeply entrenched in ajnaana.
    I agree with your intended point that such deceit is  bad.

   The answers to these questions lie with the jeeva! As Shankara
   and other AchAryas say repeatedly, the only antidote for ajnaana
   is jnaana. The disease of ajnaana lasts only as long as the
   medicine is not taken. If the jeeva does not take the medicine
   throughout its life, by choice or misfortune or any other cause,
   it suffers in ajnaana for life.

   Before a balance sheet is prepared, it is useful to point out
   the two examples you have chosen are atypical. First, your
   jiiva A is at one end of the extremes, if it feels that it is
   in ajnaana *and* nothing can done about it. Shankara and other
   AchAryas in our tradition do not condemn any jiiva to a
   perpetual life in ajnaana or duality as some of the Vaishnava
   schools do. Shankara's philosophy is miles apart from theirs.
   Let us keep our distance from such schools that are steeped in
   ignorance!

   What I mean to say is that a jiiva's recognition that it is in
   bondage and aspiring for liberation is one thing, and feeling that
   it will perpetually be in bondage is quite another. What Shankara
   feels is necessary is the first attitude, not the second. My
   impression is that your jiiva A has the second attitude, not the
   first. That is why it is atypical.

   However, your jiiva B is less atypical.  From the description,
   it is either a jnaani already because it does not have ajnaana,
   or it is afflicted by ajnaana but has not recognized that fact.
   If it is already a jnaani, it is already Brahman (brahmaiva
   san brahmaiva bhavati), and there is no comparison with a jiiva.
   If it is a jiiva that has not yet recognized the fact that it is
   subjected to ajnaana, then it means that it will have to acquire
   the four-fold qualifications which it is lacking, namely viveka,
   vairaagya, shamaadi shhaTka, and mumukshhutva. As I said earlier,
   it is only by recognizing the fact that one is subject to the
   misery of samsaara/ajnaana does one get an urge for liberation.
   And in the absence of a desire for liberation, there will be no
   jnaana and no liberation for the jiiva.

 Perhaps a re-selection of  jiiva A is warranted, since it does
 not fit with the points I have been trying to make.
