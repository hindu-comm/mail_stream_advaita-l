A similar doubt once occurred to me and I was referred to a Zen homepage
by Giri, which provided a beautiful answer to my question.

When the disciple is instructed,"Everything is the Buddha," the
intellect comes to the conclusion that there is nothing to be done, and
spiritual degeneration takes place, because *the intellect is not the
Self*. The truth that "Everything is the Buddha" is to be grasped by the
Self and not the intellect.
