 My question was intended to be more rhetorical than anything else!
 But your answer does point out one thing. It presupposes the
 (at least apparent) existence of "anything and everything that
 claims its absolute status." Unless we admit such an (albeit
 apparent) existence there is no use of the "neti neti" principle.
 In broad terms, this apparent existence is of Ishvara (God),
 jiiva (individual soul), and jagat (the world), the so-called tripod.
 This tripod is what is negated to arrive at Brahman.
 This is what I was trying to convey.

 Anand
