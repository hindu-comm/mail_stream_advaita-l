Now, how clear and distinct is the boundary between a jivanmukta
(jnAni) and non-jivanmukta (ajnAni) ?

My thinking is, it is an evolutionary process. A person does not turn
into a jnAni overnight, although such is possible. Most will see the
light over a period of time. As the human steadily becomes a jnAni
(or to say more correctly, as progressively his/her ajnAna is removed),
the human sees (i) the unreality of the joys of the present day life,
(ii) the unreality of the sorrows of the world, (iii) the unreality of
the world, (iv) and unreality of the jeeva.

In that transition stage, use of neti neti is justifiable. I suspect that
it is only in this transition state, neti neti is heard most; because
a dense ajnAni does not understand and hence has no use for neti neti,
a jivanmukta does not have to say neti neti.

My understanding is the following. AjnAna is like darkness. When the
light is switched on, darkness disappears. Darkness does not get pushed
into another room. That is, the density of darkness in the other room
does not increase. The darkness in the lighted room simply vanishes.
This is the same with any type of true knowledge. Can we remember how
we were before we learnt the alphabets ? In the same way, once ajnAna
is destroyed, there is no way ajnAna will return to us again. Then for
a jnAni state, was ajnAna there ? Probably no, just as we do not know
when we were illiterate. From that perspective, ajnAna may never be
there.

I would be most grateful for clarification of this part, particularly the
shruti reference. My feeling is: all the bondage we are under is all
imagined bondage. UpAdhi, the superposed has all the bondages, not the
substratum.
