  Considering the fact that the upanishadic principle "neti neti"
  is taught by a Guru to a disciple who is not necessarily a
  jiivanmukta already, I do not see why only a jiivanmukta should
  be using it. Your response above seems to be implying that.
  If a non-jiivanmukta should be using "neti neti", he certainly
  cannot have realized, to begin with, that the jagat, jiiva, and
  Ishvara are not real. When he learns the "neti neti" principle
  from the Guru, he then realizes the unreality of jiiva, etc.

  A more important point I am trying to make here is that according
  to advaita, ajnaana or avidyaa has no beginning, but it does have
  an end for those receive jnaana! From some of the points made on
  this list, it seems to me that some people here are of the opinion
  that ajnaana has no beginning and no end either because it simply
  does never exist. While this may be true from the paaramaarthika
  view, we (at least most of us!) are not born liberated. So we
  accept that there is ajnaana which must be got rid of.  The
  argument that if one merely thinks he is liberated he is indeed so
  and if he thinks he is in bondage he is indeed so, is faulty in that
  it makes a mockery of shruti and various teachings that our
  Achaaryas have left behind.

 Anand
