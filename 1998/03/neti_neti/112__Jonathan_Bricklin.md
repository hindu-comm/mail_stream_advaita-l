Anand,

Thank you for your ever as always thoughtful and penetrating commentary.

You end, though, with a question that seems too easy to answer:

"If the Shruti were to
 declare only that "Brahman is all there is", what is there to
 negate with "neti neti"?"

The quick answer, which probably means I don't understand the question,
would be:

Anything and everything that claims its absolute status.

Metta,
