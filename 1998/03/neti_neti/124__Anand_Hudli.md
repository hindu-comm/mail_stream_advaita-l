I did write about this question in my last message. To reiterate
what I wrote, advaita does not require anyone to consider himself/
 herself as an ajnaani perpetually. All it says is recognize
 that ego, body, etc. are the binding forces keeping us in bondage
 and make an attempt to free oneself. This is a far cry from
 asking us to consider ourselves to be ajnaani's for ever. As I said,
 I did write about this yesterday.

Please see what I said in my last message and also above.

 Agreed. But that stage will not be reached by the outright
 denial of ajnaana even before one has had a chance to keep the
 ego, the senses under control.

Anand
