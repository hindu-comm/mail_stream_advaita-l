 This depends on which standpoint you are looking from. A jiivanmukta
 may not consider the difference but from a vyaavahaarika view, there
 is a sea of difference. The obvious difference being, that the
 person with ajnaana identifies the Self with the body, possessions,
 etc.

 Regardless of whether jnaana comes suddenly or over a period of time
 (depending on the person), the point I was trying to make is that
 jnaana or vidyaa will result in the destruction of ajnaana. And
 this acquistion of jnaana is an event, which is also the end of
 ajnaana. As you said, the event may be short or spread over a
 period of time; it is an event nevertheless. As
 Shankara says emphatically over and over again, in his works,
 for example, vidyaiva ajnaanahaanaaya (upadeshasaahasrii).
 So to deny ajnaana to begin with, ie. before the dawn of jnaana,
 would be missing the point.

 I agree. That is what I was saying in my previous message.

 That is alright. But I was trying to point out that it is not
 correct to deny ajnaana prior to becoming a jnaani. Such denial
 will probably be the equivalent of spiritual suicide.

 No advaitin will assert that bondage is real in an absolute sense.
 But at the same time, it is asserted in the texts that ajnaana or
 avidyaa has no beginning. It is only by receiving proper jnaana
 (called samyak jnaana) that this ajnaana or bondage comes to an end.
 In the Chhaandogya upanishhad, a story is told about how a man is
 brought blind folded from the Gaandhaara desha to a forest. He has
 to find his way back home, and he can only do so by receiving proper
 instructions, and go from village to village until he reaches his
 destination. The point here is that for a person in ajnaana, seeking
 proper jnaana is essential. Otherwise, he cannot free himself from
 samsaara. There is no use in denying bondage at that stage. In fact,
 such denial will be counter productive.

 In the samskshhepa shaariiraka, which is an abridged explanation
 of the Brahma suutras based on Shankara's commentary, the author
 Sarvajnaatman makes the point that due to avidyaa, a person even
 after listening to statements about Brahman will not be in position
 to truly understand them.

 Furthermore, one of the essential qualifications of a student of
 advaita, mentioned repeatedly in the texts is that of mumukshhutva,
 the desire for liberation. Without this desire for liberation, the
 learning and instruction will not be effective. Now how does a
 desire for liberation arise? Necessarily, by the recognition that
 one is in bondage in the present state. This being so, if the
 would-be student thinks, "There is no bondage, no liberation, no
 seekers after liberation. Why do I need the instructions of the
 Guru?", this will be a most negative attitude. The spiritual life
 of the student is doomed.

 Again, to clear up any misunderstanding, there may be no meaning to
 bondage and liberation when one is established in that fourth
 "turiiya" state. But bondage and liberation are significant for
  those who are yet to realize that state. If there were to be no
 such significance, all the shruti's and teachings of the AchAryas
 would be without a purpose. The only true purpose of such teachings
 is the removal of ajnaana. As has been pointed out earlier in this
 list, removal of ajnaana by jnaana is like removing a thorn with
 another. Once the thorn which is causing pain in the foot is
 removed, both the thorns will be discarded. But  when the
 thorn is still stuck in the foot, one cannot deny its presence!
 It may very well be the case, that once the thorn has been removed,
 the foot heals to such an extent that one forgets being injured by
 the thorn.
