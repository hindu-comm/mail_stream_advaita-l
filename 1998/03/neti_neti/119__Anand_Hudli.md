 This depends on which standpoint you are looking from. A jiivanmukta
 may not consider the difference but from a vyaavahaarika view, there
 is a sea of difference. The obvious difference being, that the
 person with ajnaana identifies the Self with the body, possessions,
 etc.

 Regardless of whether jnaana comes suddenly or over a period of time
 (depending on the person), the point I was trying to make is that
 jnaana or vidyaa will result in the destruction of ajnaana. And
 this acquistion of jnaana is an event, which is also the end of
 ajnaana. As you said, the event may be short or spread over a
 period of time; it is an event nevertheless. As
 Shankara says emphatically over and over again, in his works,
 for example, vidyaiva ajnaanahaanaaya (upadeshasaahasrii).
 So to deny ajnaana to begin with, ie. before the dawn of jnaana,
 would be missing the point.

 I agree.

 That is right. But I was trying to point out that it is not
 correct to deny ajnaana prior to becoming a jnaani. Such denial
 will probably be the equivalent of spiritual suicide.

 No advaitin will assert that bondage is real in an absolute sense.
 But at the same time, it is asserted in the texts that ajnaana or
 avidyaa has no beginning. It is only by receiving proper jnaana
 (called samyak jnaana) that this ajnaana or bondage comes to an end.
 Of course, after becoming a jnaani, one may find that there is no
 liberation and no bondage, no seekers, etc. In the Chhaandogya
 upanishad, the story is told of how a man is brought blindfolded
 from the Gaandhaara desha and left in a dense forest. He must then
 find out his way back home by receiving instructions, going from
 one village to another. This story is referred to in many advaitic
 works. For example, the Samkshhepa Shaariiraka, which is said to be
 a condensation of the Brahmasuutra Bhaashhya of Shankara, says that
 due to avidyaa, even though a person listens to statements being
 made about Brahman, still he/she remains unrealized.

 Furthermore, one of the qualifications of a student of advaita,
 mentioned over and over again in advaitic works is mumukshhutva,
 the desire for liberation. If the student in question, instead
 thinks, "There is no liberation, no bondage. Why do I need the
 instruction of the Guru?" This will be a most negative thought
 on the part of such a student, to say the least. As has been pointed
 out on this list before, removing ajnaana or avidyaa may be like
 removing a thorn with another thorn, jnaana. Once the thorn or
 avidyaa is removed, both thorns can be discarded. But it does not
 make sense to deny the thorn of avidyaa and, of course the pain
 caused by it, _before_ it is removed. After the removal of the thorn,
 the foot may heal so much that one may even forget that the foot had
 been injured once by a thorn.
