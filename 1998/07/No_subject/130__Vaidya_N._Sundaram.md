Namaskaram.

 I fail to see how, when you say that the messenger should not be
attacked, you at the same time can say the above as well as ...

 and also say ...

 Every one of the numbered arguments start with "Shri Giridhar". Are you
not doing exactly what you do not want others to do ? : namely, put the
"messenger" under the microscope?


Cheers,

 The place, time, objects and their knower etc., projected in a dream
during sleep are all mithyA (an illusion/false). So too, here. in the
waking state, the world that is seen is a projection by one's own
ignorance. Likewise, this body, the senses, the breath, the ego etc.,
are all unreal. Therefore, That thou art, the peaceful, defectless,
supreme, non-dual Brahman.  -- Adi Shankara in VivekacUdAmani.
