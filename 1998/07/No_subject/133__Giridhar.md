Since you did not comment on the sentence above, I presume that
you agree with the above statement. As I remarked earlier, this
applies to _everyone_ who forsakes spirituality with the objective
of fulfilling their material ambition. Of course, that includes me.

 Was Ramana Maharshi economically well-off ? Did He ever
_want_ to be economically well-off ? Well, there's your answer to the
question, 'Who doesn't want to be ... economically well-off ?'  Did any of
our other saints want to be rich ? Have you heard of Ramakrishna paramhansa
constant warning against attachment to kanchana ?

>Does "Hinduism" preach that a man should not be any of these?

No, but it does say that these are not _as important as_ having bhakti or
jnana. To extend it further, any one who forsakes
spirituality for being clean and economically  well-off is living a life which
is antithesis to moksha. Just imho.

Maybe.

Ah ! Then you agree that you should become a rightful insider to
understand the subtleliyies. Well, then to understand Shankara, don't
we have to listen to acharyas in that lineage and not impose our own
ideas and thoughts. Think about it. All that was presented here were
several quotes from HH from Sringeri and Kanchi to clarify various
issues on fate, free will, puja, dharma etc.
                Is it right of us, without becoming a rightful insider, to criticize

the views of these great acharyas _without_ any logic or reason ?

Who is this nobody ? Do you read all the articles which appear in various
newspapers and magazines ? Even a cursory glance would reveal that there
are several social organizations which spend their time and effort so that
the culture flourishes. Of course, there are numerous obstacles and problems,
but there are enough articles on removing inconveniences so that the Hinduism
culture can flourish.

Don't worry about it.

AUM shaantiH
