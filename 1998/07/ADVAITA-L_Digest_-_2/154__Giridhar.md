Since I receive the list in digest form, please allow me to discuss various
issues
in one post. Sorry for the trouble...

Couple of weeks back, there was this distant cousin of mine who had
failed mathematics in 7th standard. I was called to "counsel" him and
tell the utility of studies. He, off the cuff, told me that he will become an
Einstein
and I should not tell him what to do. Though I agreed with the latter, I was
shocked
why he was so confident of becoming an Einstein. Because, he said, Einstein
also
failed in high school.

Can you become a great scientist after failing in high school ? Maybe yes, but
it does not apply to everyone. Similarly, Janaka is an exception, not the
rule.
When Shankara says that moksha can be attained by people who have not taken
physical sannyas, he is talking about exceptions. It is extremely clear from
His works.

Regarding the question of why Krishna cites Janaka, it has been answered many
many times
by Anand, me and Rama. Specifically, read the references in Rama's post on 16
April, 1998. The key word to jog your memory is chitta shuddhi.

Anyway, since I know you respect Ramakrishna paramahamsa and Swami Vivekananda
a lot, why don't you the read the former views on "kanchana, kamini and living
in the world" or the latter's satirical words on how he found several Janakas
in the West and what he really thinks of living in the world like a Janaka.

Rama, thanks for your candidness. I felt the article fitted many NRIs,
including
me. And the thing about 'forsaking the spiritual for the material' applies
to a
lot of people, whether they are in India or US.

Yes, I only wanted to convey that.

>Aside: It's surprising to me that many people identify themselves with

LOL !

>No one is uneasy having you here. Why do you think that everyone has to

Yes, in fact, I have enjoyed several posts by GM on upanishhads.

>accept all your views or that we are "uneasy" with you? Certainly some
>of us may disagree with you, but why do you feel uneasy about that? :-).

Exactly. Further, how can you become uneasy when you believe that
I have no free will in posting ? :-)

>Please stay for more time and enjoy it further! Again, objections to

Similarly, Jaldhar and I have argued quite vehemently and so have Jaldhar and
Rama. It does not mean I do not write to Rama or Jaldhar privately ! Also, I
have disagreed with certain
views of Rama but later found them to be correct and ultimately learned from
him.

>disagreement with one's views and dislike or "uneasiness" of someone.
>Please think about it.

Yes, please do.

Well, there are different views on when varalakshmi vratam should be
celebrated. Some say it is the second friday of the Tamil month Adi.
Anyway, many Tamil smarthas (but not all, I learn from my priest) will
celebrate it on 31 July while most Kannadigas will celebrate it on 7th
August. 7th August is also yajur veda upa karma.
============================================================

The first two chapters of RIBHU gita is ready in ITRANS format. I would be
extremely thankful if someone volunteers to proofread it. No time limits !!

namaste.

Subject: Introduction (for joining the list)

Namaste,
   I have been an ardent beleiver in the philosophy of advaita for long. I
have studied to some extent Viveka Chudamani and  Bhagavatpada's commentry
on Bagatvatgita and have found great pleasure in  reciting various stotras
composed by Sri Shankara Bhagatpada. I do not consider myself to be
knowledgeable enough to participate in the debate on the list, but I would
be an enthusiastic listener to the healthy discossion on the list.

    Thanking you.

Yes Ravi....I am glad that you realised it yourself. You are the list
"moderator" and I think your job ends there. Nobody wants silly remarks
and retorts from you all the time.

The list is going on wonderfully without your saucy "inputs", I dare
say. We are interested in studying the thoughts of Sankaracharya, if you
remember!

Regards,  Kamal
