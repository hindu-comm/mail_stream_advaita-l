Thanks for the explanation! Yes, surrendering to God would really mean
surrendering the ego.

But my question pertains only to the case when the puujaa is indeed

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A small correction: the last line should read "...established in
Brahman." When the goal is reached, not even "advaitic teaching" is seen
to be real.
