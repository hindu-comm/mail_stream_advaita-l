Hello,

I haven't seen you post before, I think you must be a new list-member. I
am not sure if my previous message was the first message you read. No
one claimed everyone has to take up physical sannyAsa. If you read my
posts on pUjA (please refer the archives) and then my previous post,
you'll realize that my post had nothing to do with sannyAsa per se. The
point I wanted to make was completely different and I only tangentially
touched upon sannyAsa, only because I had to. As to sannyAsa etc and
importance of actual, physical renunciation of possessions, please refer
to the Giri's excellent post, which you should be able to find in the
archives. I posted a pointer to that message about 2-3 months back also.
Also refer to Anand Hudli's various posts on karma, sannyAsa etc.

As to statements like "I am truth" etc, if you really have realized
that, my humble obeisances to you. If you are merely repeating what some
GYAni said, it's of no consequence. Sorry to sound churlish, but in the
past this list was inundated with posts which carried statements like
this from various people as "answers" to any and every question. I have
completely lost my patience with this type of stuff.

Rama.

Very good of you to bring up the name of a GYAni. Here's what he says
about pUjA:

Pandit Bala Kak Dhar, a jagridar from Kashmir, had come all the way from
Srinagar to have darshan of Bhagavan on Dipavali day. He gave a bundle
of papers to Sri Bhagavan containing an account of his life and
position. His talks with Bhagavan were all personal.

One of his questions was: "Now that I have had darshan of Sri Bhagavan
and it is enough for me, may I throw all the charms, tantras and pujas
into the river?"

M: Daily puja as presribed in the Dharma Sastras is always good. It is
for the purification of the mind. Even if one feels oneself too advanced
to need such puja, still it must be performed for the sake of others.
Such action will be an example to ones children and dependents."

(Talks with Sri RM, page 522)

My point of the post had nothing to do with what you are talking here
(BTW what is this vyavahArika advaita? Is there a pAramArthika advaita
also?)

Very good. I was talking about performing the duties vs renouncing them
as by a sannyAsi. This is what is meant by renouncing karma. It should
have been fairly obvious.

I think I didn't make my point clear.

Again, read carefully:

If everything is alloted by prArabdha karma one should do one's duties
with detachment (karma includes the duties enjoined by smR^iti also) and
also get the fat paycheck with the same detachment. I was pointing out
that on this list many have prescribed NOT PERFORMING the duties (worse
is claiming one can do it any way one pleases), since karma cannot lead
to moxa as per Shankara. But the same people are getting fat paychecks
etc with "detachment". If one really believes that fat paychecks, AC car
etc are due to prArabdha they should ALSO PERFORM their alloted duties
in the same detached manner. Why is the performance of duties, which
requires EFFORT, being given up while AC cars, etc (which make life
convenient) are accepted with "detachment"?

Do I make myself clear? Have I pointed out clearly the absurdity of the
situation?

Rama.
