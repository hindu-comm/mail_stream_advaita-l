AUM saundaryalaharI mukhya bahustotra vidhAyakAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who provided us many stotram-s like saundaryalaharI
for worship. shrI shankara keeping in mind of many sAdhaka-s who are not
ready for study of vedAnta and Atmavichara, composed many works promoting
bhakti which will lead them to that state.
