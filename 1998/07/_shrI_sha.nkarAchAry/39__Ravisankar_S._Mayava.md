AUM R^iShyashR^i"ngapureshvarAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who is the lord of R^iShyashR^ingapuri (now known
as shR^ingeri). shrI shankara established the first maTham at Sringeri and
nominated shrI sureshvarAcharya as its head. It is said that shrI shankara
also stayed at shR^ingeri for a very long period (12 years).
