Pranams to all!

I am trying to learn to avoid arguments, criticisms, judgements and learn what
one has to say about vedas, upanishads, advaita and various traditions from
the posts of learned members.

Looks to me today the list generated more posts on kartiks comment on Ravi and
the like and less of spiritual discussions.  One should ignore such posts as
they do not qualify a response.

Let Devi's grace be with all                                         Nagy
