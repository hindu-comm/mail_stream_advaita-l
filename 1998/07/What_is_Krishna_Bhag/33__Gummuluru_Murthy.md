Namaste.

One of the techniques used in the modern day debating and in committee
meetings is: If one does not like the message, attack the messenger and
the credibility of the messenger. That way, attention is taken away from
the (unliked) message and is shifted to the credibility of the messenger.
But when looked very closely, that particular tactic actually shows the
weakness of the point being made by the follower of that technique.

Shri Ravi in the above post does not address the main topic of the
thread, but questions my credibility to make the point that I am making.
I think we should stick to the topic of the thread rather than
discussing the eligibility or otherwise of the participants to make
the point they are making. If we have learnt anything from ManIshhA
panchakam (which has been discussed half a dozen times in this forum),
we would know that the Truth will come from all sources either a canDAla,
a grihastha or a sUdra or a mlechha.

I have not claimed any superior knowledge compared to the other members.
My posts contain the truth as I see it. When I refer to upanishhad or some
other source, I give proper reference. It is regrettable that Shri Ravi's
thinking is to question my credibility (as a grihastha to make the point
of paramArtha satyam) rather than deal with the topic of the thread.

Pray, may I ask why it is misleading ? Is the paramArtha truth different
coming from a grihastha rather than from one in nirvikalpa samAdhi ?
Further, I have never equated jeeva to Ishwara, nor jeevanmikta to
Ishwara, nor jeeva to jeevanmukta. I pointed out that both jeeva and
Ishwara are in the realm of mAya. It is only Shri Ravi going through the
various equations.

I mentioned in a private post to a list member sometime ago and it may be
relevant here.

...
I put four grades in the evolution of jeeva's thinking:

jeeva unreal/Ishwara unreal: ultimate advaitic understanding
jeeva unreal/Ishwara real: a stage where we see ourselves as characters in
                                Ishwara's drama
jeeva real/Ishwara real: dvaita concepts
jeeva real/Ishwara unreal:  mooDha concepts
...

One cannot attain It by doing vyavahArika tidbits, going from pillar
to pillar, and discussing personalities either.

There seem to be an opinion here that somehow I said sAdhana is not
important. I do not see why people try to put those words in my mouth.
I would ask Shri Ravi to give the reference to the exact place where I
said sAdhana is not important, if not, withdraw that particular portion
of the post as it is irrelevant and untrue.

I touched on this point above. Let me end this post by quoting from Viveka
ChuDAmaNi by Shri Shankara:


svasy'avidyA-bandha-sambandha-mokshAt
satya-jnAnAnanda-rUpAtma-labdhau
shAstram yuktir deshikoktih pramANam
c'Antas-siddhA sv'AnubhUtih pramANam    (verse 474)

Whether you are free from your ignorance or not, you alone know. To
know one's own freedom from the bondage that comes from contact with
ignorance and the attainment of the state of pure existence knowledge
and bliss, the scriptures, reason, and the words of the guru are the
proofs. But one's own conviction felt within is the greatest of all.


bandho mokshashca tr^ptishca cintA'Arogya-kshud'Adayah
sven'aiva vedyA yaj-jnAnam pareshhAm AnumAnikam         (verse 475)

Bondage or freedom, attainment or otherwise, anxiety or peace,
pleasure or pain  -  one knows these in one's own self. Others can
only guess.

Thus, please do not worry whether the participant in the debate is a
dvija, grihastha, sannyAsin, sUdra, mleccha, a realized or an unrealized
person. That is not for you to judge. See the point that is made, see
whether it is the truth or not. That is the objective of this forum.

thus, he, to whom there is firm knowledge in respect of the eternal,
blemishless supreme, which is unexcelled bliss, is the preceptor, be
he a canDAla or a brAhmaNa. This is my conclusive view.
