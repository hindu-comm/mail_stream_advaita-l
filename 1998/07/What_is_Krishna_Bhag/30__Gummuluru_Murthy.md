Namaste.

I am grateful to Shri Sadananda, Anand Hudli, Vaidya Sundaram, Ravi
and (by private e-mail) another list-member for responding to my query
re Shrikrishna.

Thanks for posting Madhusudana's commentary on this verse. The key part,
in my view, is interpretation of "mAM vetti tattvataH" as given in the
last but one paragraph above "seeing  Shrikrishna, Ishwara, as
non-different from the inner self, based on mahAvAkyAs.."

JnAnam, certainly, is not a mind game. It is neither a game nor a
thing deduced by the mind intellectually or logically. However,
ajnAnam IS a mind game.

Shri Anand says in a further post on the same thread:

I did not get this fully.

If it is not the mind, what is the source of this thinking of bondage ?

Who is it that *guarantees* liberation ? What is this *guarantee* ?


-----------------

I have another question on this verse. An implication of the use of
"manushhyAnAm" in this verse is to say that species other than humans
(e.g. animals, birds etc) are not eligible for moksha i.e. only
humans have the privilege or authority to get out of the bondage of
this samsAra. Therefore, anyone who is born as a human has to do the
effort for moksha.

I contrast this "manushhyAnAm" in this context with YudhishhTirA's
question to Bhishhma in Vishnu sahasranAma

".... kiM japanmucyate *jantur* janma samsAra bandhanAt"

By doing which japa can creatures (jantu) go beyond the bond of
samsAra ?

The implication here is: all species are eligible for moksha and
can go beyond the bondage of samsAra.

Is there a difference in the two verses, in terms of moksha-adhikAra ?
