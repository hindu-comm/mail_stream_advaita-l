Namaste. A belated response to the above post.

Let me conceptualize it this way. Shrikrishna and Arjuna are one and the
same and BG is an internal discussion within Arjuna where the higher Self
Krishna teaches the lower self Arjuna. Krishna and Arjuna are in different
planes, one in paramArtha and the other in vyavahArika. Communication
between the planes can take place internal to the jeeva, as seen in the
vyavahArika plane. As seen from paramArtha, of course, there is no
communication since Atman is ever still.

Yes, Krishna is one without a second and is the same Krishna that pervades
Arjuna, Duryodhana and all jeevas. From Krishna's (Atman's) vision,
everything is the same. Arjuna killing a kaurava or Duryodhana killing
someone else does not really matter. From Arjuna and Duryodhana's
perspective, they are different and the war and events have to proceed
(for their own personal gains).

Re Arjuna being fit and Duryodhana not being fit for the teaching of Gita:
Can this not be looked at in the context of Katha 1.2.23 [the Self
will present itself to whom it chooses]. Again, this is a vyavahArika
explanation and thinking of why Arjuna got the teaching while Duryodhana
did not. From the Self's perspective (if It has a perspective), there is
no Arjuna, there is no Duryodhana. We, the other jeevas in the vyavahArika
plane interpret it that Duryodhana is not fit while Arjuna is fit. But is
that the REAl situation ? Events have unfolded as they should and every
actor has acted their role to the utmost. As it should be and as it always
will be. Thus, can we say that Duryodhana is unfit whereas Arjuna is fit
(to receive Gita upadesha) ?

I agree. But, let us look at verse BG 18.55.

bhaktyA mAm abhijAnAti yAvAn yashcA 'smi tattvatah
tato mAm tattvato jnAtvA vishate tadanantaram.

Through devotion (bhakti), jeeva comes to know Me, what My measure is and
who I am in truth; *then* (GM's emphasis), having known Me in truth, he
forthwith enters into Me.

The specific word here is tadanantaram, then: i.e. after knowing Ishwara
through bhakti, the jeeva attains the result of that knowing; viz the
eradication of avidya and attainment of moksha; i.e. karama and bhakti
with dispassion (vairAgyam) are the routes for jnAnam (Atman is Brahman)
and with jnAnam, jeeva attains moksha.

My understanding of "enters into Me" in BG 18.55 is where the jeeva looses
individuality, and the lower self melts into the higher Self.

Any confusion or inconsistency in my thinking ?
