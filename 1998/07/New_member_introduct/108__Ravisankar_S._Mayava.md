Dear Ravi

Thank you for adding me to this list. I have been a student of yoga and
meditation for many years. A retired teacher, I have time and interest to
pursue my understanding and practice of advaita. I have read some of
Ramana Maharshi, Shankara's Crest Jewel and others. Help is needed in
terms of understanding non-duality and of how to practice meditation. Any
advice or suggestions are welcome.
