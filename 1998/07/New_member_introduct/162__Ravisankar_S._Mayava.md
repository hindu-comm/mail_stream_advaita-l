Hi Ravi,

Here is my  introduction.

Hi,
I am interested in learning more about Advaita and Vedanta from people on
the list. I belong to the SriVaishnava Sampradaayam and I am open to other
people's views and support healthy discussions that would lead us to a
better understanding of what we believe in. My spiritual learning has
been restricted to the Gita, which I believe applies to all situations
that I have faced and at all times. I will be a listener for the most part
until such time that I deem fit to contribute constructively. Thank you
for letting me join the list.

Regards,
Praveen
