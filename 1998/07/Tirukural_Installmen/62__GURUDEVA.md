Eradication of Desire

Verse 361

At all times and to all creatures
The seed of ceaseless births is desire.

Verse 362

If you must desire, desire freedom from birth.
That will only come by desiring desirelessness.

Verse 363

Here no fortune is as dear as desirelessness;
And even there nothing like it can be found.

Verse 364

Purity is but freedom from desire,
And that is achieved by desiring to know Truth.
