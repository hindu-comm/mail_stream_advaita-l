Dear Members,

namaste:

I went back and read the Archives of List-Owners's list:
http://listserv.tamu.edu/cgi/wa?A2=ind9806&L=am-ownr&O=T&P=1076

The only way seems to be user education. As the technology moves
more towards, PC side, these problems may crop up. So I again
request you to check the settings and send only simple
ASCII text files. MIME formatting, HTML formatting, Rich Text,
or Images should NOT be sent to the list.

I am sorry to bore you with such messages. I have no option.

With respects,
Ravi
