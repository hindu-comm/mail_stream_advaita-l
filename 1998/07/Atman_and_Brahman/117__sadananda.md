Yes, as your first line states that, both are concepts.  "I AM" is
independent of the concepts since concepts are in the realm of the
intellect, I am - is the one who has the concepts.  In "I AM" there is
neither jeeva or jagat - and Atman and Brahman are just words, fall out
with no locus. What is real is only "I AM".  There is where my discussion
of scriptures as a pramana for Brahman pertained. Scriptures identify -
ayamaatmaa Brahma -  equating the apparently the two to one, which is
beyond words and concepts, and hence beyond logic too since even the logic
is in the realm of intellect.

At that state there is no need to think since you are beyond the realm of
thoughts.  Just be.

Lakshmidhara kavi says in Advaita vedanta:

        mayyevodeti chidvyomni jagat gandharva pattanam|
        athoham na kutham brahma sarvaJNam sarva kaaranaM|

In my conscious space  the whole world of illusory word of plurality raises.
Therefore, how can I not be Brahman, who is the all knower and cause for all.
Everything is in me, and I am in everything, and every "thing" is nothing
but that has illusory existence. What is present all the time that which is
beyond time is just me, aham. - no Brahman, no Atman, no scriptures and no
vedanta too - they all come under the apara vidya.

Hari Om!
