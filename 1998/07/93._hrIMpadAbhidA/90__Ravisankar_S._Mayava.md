93. hrIMpadAbhidA

SHE who is explained by hrIM.

There is a rule that a composite object should be explained by a composite
word. hrIM is made of "ha", "ra", "I", and "M", as explained in previous
names. Since paradevata form is composite, it is explained by hrIM.

AUM hrIMpadAbhidAyai namaH

Note: By mistake I numebered 94 and 95th names as 93 and 94 in my pervious
posts. I am sorry for the error.
