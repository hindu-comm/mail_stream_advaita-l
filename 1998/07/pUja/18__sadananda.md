The rest of my post actually justifies why the lack of interest too!

I see in this and in the subsequent posts that you have lot of
disagreements with my post.  I will certainly read them and contemplate on
them.  Thanks for your detailed input.

The examples I gave were intended to drive across the point of the
discussion and not intended for extrapulation beyond their intent. Anyway
we both atleast agree that the whole discussion is itself within the realm
of maya.    My understanding of the Geeta and Bhagavaan Shankaraa's texts
obviously differs from yours.  I donot see any further need for my
discussion on this topic otherthan to state that I agree to disagree with
your interpretation of my post.  God bless you.

Hari Om!
