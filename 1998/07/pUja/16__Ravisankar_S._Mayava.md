Thanks for your beautiful post. In fact after reading your earlier post
again, I understood that chitta shuddhi is through getting rid of ego,
not by gaining something from outside. You made it very clear using the
"taking bath" example.

Thanks a lot for the nice examples. They drive home the point very
clearly.

with respects
Ravi
