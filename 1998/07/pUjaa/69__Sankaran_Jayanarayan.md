Yes. This only means that praayashchitta ought to apply in the case I
mentioned above, since all possible effort was made, but consider the
situation when the person performing the puujaa finds that his father is
in critical condition in the hospital and needs his (the son's)
attention. I should think that the puujaa *will* have to be
discontinued. Performing the puujaa knowing that this would indirectly
be the cause of a death is far worse, IMO.

Yes.

Thanks for the above quote.
