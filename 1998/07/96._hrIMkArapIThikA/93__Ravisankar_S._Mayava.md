96. hrIMkArapIThikA

SHE is the basis for the word hrIM.

pITha means basis or support. SHE is the basis or support for hrIM.  A
word owes its existence to the meaning, and the meaning is its support.
mantra and the deity are one and same. But in this name a difference is
brought to show that the inherent power of the meaning is not apparent in
the word.

pIThikA means residence. SHE is the residence of hrIM. The power of hrIM
resides in HER. SHE is made known or objectified through the word hrIM.
