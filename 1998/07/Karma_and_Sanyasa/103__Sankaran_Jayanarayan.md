I should thank you for taking the trouble to explain. Actually, I didn't
quite understand why you were very "fundamentalistic" about samnyaasa. I
really thought you were preaching that
1) everyone ought to take up samnyAsa, or
2) since most of us are incapable of taking up samnyaasa, moksha is
impossible for us.

At least, reading your article made me believe so. Perhaps Maadhavan was
also thinking along the same lines.

Yes. But they always qualified their statements with "of course, for
people like Janaka, physical samnyaasa was not necessary." (I think Giri
always explicitly said so.)

I'm sorry, but I got confused. Maybe you should qualify your statements
a little more, though it takes more time to type.
