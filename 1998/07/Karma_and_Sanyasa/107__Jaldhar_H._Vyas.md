Not exactly.  He says a pramana cannot be authoritative in the domain of
another pramana.

Since the domain of shabda pramana is to explain the nature of Moksha, it
is anumana or logic which is out of bounds.

Sannyasa IS renunciation!

!!! A person who is not attached to physical things is by definition a
bhautika sannyasi.  So what is the distinction you're trying to make here?

Ok.  But to prove that sannyasa is not essential you would have to give
the example of a non-sannyasi who is non-attached.  But by your definition
above such a thing is an oxymoron.

the tatparya of this verse is that _just_ giving up the niyamas
isn't enough.  It must be accompanied by vairagya.  Thus one who has this
sense of detachment is more praiseworthy (more of a sannyasi and yogi) than
one who doesn't. But read the next two verses.  They make it clear that
even more praiseworthy than this is the person who mentally _and_
physically renounces.

So far from being a praise of "Armchair" sannyasa these verses are
actually recommending karma.  Krishna Bhagavan is saying if you are not
mentally ready, do not practice Vedanta at all.  Practice karma until you
are really ready.

It's somewhat disingeneous to quote a shloka out of context to suggest one
thing when Shankaracharya many times in his phlosphical works vehemently
claims the other.  To Shankaracharya sannyasa isn't just "a good idea" it
is an essential requirement.

Besides this shloka is saying that even in the midst of bhoga and sangha
one can remain revelling in Brahman.  Because _after_ one has attained
moksha nothing od that sort exists anymore.  I don't see how you get bliss
is "all that counts" out of it.

Except in this case if one continues with karma one has never gotten on
the horse.

> Action is essential for the purification of the mind

This is not the Advaita view.  Karma can bring about conditions favorable
to purification of the mind.  But that purification does not in any way
depend on karma.   So it cannot be considered essential.

But as long as there is no sannyasa the mind will never be free as it is
karma itself which causes the pressure.

Yes, sannyasa.

I agree.  But we shoud also agree to understand when we are in error and
not get upset when we are corrected.

The mere existence of other interpretations does not mean they are valid.

Not so because we are not discussing some unknown thing.  we are
discussing the teachings of Advaita Vedanta which has a history, set
doctrines, and authoritative teachers.  Given this we can indeed judge the
validity of a particular viewpoint.  Perhaps not all but in the case of
the necessity of sannyasa the answer is crystal clear.  It is necessary
and to say otherwise is wrong.

Neither do they depend on one persons "evaluation."

Then please don't.  But we should bear in mind that a stubborn refusal to
face the truth is the ultimate fanaticism.
