I think it is not frightening for the brahmavit. It is only frightening
for us, as we do not understand it properly. It is for this reason that
the AcAryas do not speak of vedAnta to the general public. There is fear
only where there is a second. If one makes an effort to develop the
qualities of Sama, dama, titikshA, vairAgya etc., it will go a long way in
facing this fear and overcoming it.
