namaste

I request the list members not to send files which are formattted
in HTML/ specially formatted. Please send a simple ascii file. I
understand that WWW browsers and mailtools on the Windows
95/98/NT side is getting pretty sepcialized. But the the Archives
of our LIST may be affected by such format. I am not a specialist
on how to set up these things on your mailtool. But, in netscape,
there is an option to send ascii only.

I hope this does not inconvenience you. There is a way (which I
learnt recently from LIST-OWNERS MAILING LIST) to filter these
files out. Before, I learn and implement that, it will be a week
or so. So I request you to adhere to this guideline.

Hope this does not inconvenience you much.

With respects,
Ravi
