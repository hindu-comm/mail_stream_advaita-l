namaskAram

I recently learnt while typing the meaning of "ekabhaktimadArchitA" that
according to shrImad bhAgAvatam bhakti is of nine kinds.

1) shravaNam (Hearing of God's name)
2) kIrtanam  (Singing God's glories)
3) mananam   (Remembering God's name)
4) pAdasevanam (Resorting to God feet)
5) archana or pUja (worshipping God )
6) namaskAram (Salutation to God)
7) dAsyam  ( Having a servant attitude towards God like shrI hanumAn)
8) sakhyam ( Having a friendly attitude towards God like arjuna)
9) Atmanivedanam ( Surrendering oneself completely to God)


I request those who have studied bhagavatam in depth to give the details and
examples.

Thank you.

Ravi
