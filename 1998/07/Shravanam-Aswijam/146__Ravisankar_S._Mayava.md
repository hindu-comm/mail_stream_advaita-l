namaste

This Friday (31/July/1998) is shrI varalakShmi vratam. I think
shree's page has the complete pUjavidhiH for that. I think some
celebrate on 7th. It should be celebrated on the friday before
paurnami, and the paurnami is exactly on 7th of August (friday).

May shrI mahAlakShmI bless us all with contented mind.

namaste'stu mahAmAye shrI pIThe surapUjite |
shanka chakra gata haste mAhAlakShmI namostute ||
