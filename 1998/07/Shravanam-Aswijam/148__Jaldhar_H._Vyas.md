In Gujarat it is Shravana when we do Shiva Puja.  At the
beginning of the month we make a "partheeva" (out of clay.) Shivalinga to
worship.  Then at the end of the month we return it to a river.

Women do this puja on Fridays.  They also do "sol somavar vrat" on the 16
Mondays of Chaturamas.

Whoever said no? If some so called sannyAsI did not follow sannyAsa
properly is it a problem of the sannyAsa dharma or the people who
(don't) follow it? If some incomptent civil engineer builds a bridge and
it breaks down is it the fault of the civil engineer or with the
discipline of civil engineering?

Frankly all this has been already answered 100s of times in this list
and it mmakes me wonder who is "re-hashing" issues. If you don't have
the capacity to take up sannyAsa why not admit it? There is instead an
effort to disparage the sannyAsa dharma by giving pointless examples.

Rama.
