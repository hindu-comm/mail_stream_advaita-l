Excellent response. Exactly what I wanted to say. Further may I add that
claiming some so called eclectic method (which is the same as the son of
a barren woman) is better, is only another form of "intolerance" giving
the satisfying delusion of being "tolerant".

In our world we'll strongly condemn all tenets of Nazism as garbage and
prefer to be "intolerant". I guess these "eclectics" will instead
embrace half of it, e.g., instead of killing a million jews, kill half a
million and create Isreal for the other half million and be tolerantly
eclectic!

NOTE: Just to jog people's memory a bit, we are talking about advaita
vedAnta as taught by sha.nkara. Let's stick to that, shall we? If anyone
thinks vedAnta taught by sha.nkara is akin to "social intolerance"
he/she is free to leave the forum at once.

Rama.
