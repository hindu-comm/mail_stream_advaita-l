Then clean the place before worshiping there! It's that simple!! It's
rather obvious, IMO. How does that contradict what I said about
following rules? If you did not know about the rule, it's your fault and
not the persons who discovered/established the rules.

Pl. see above.

Yes, one should make the effort of going to a pundit, reading a few
books and making sure before doing pUjA-s. Please read my post before
engaging in tarka. I CLEARLY mentioned that when the person already
KNOWS that 100% effort has NOT been made, ignorance is no excuse. If you
truly feel you have made 100% effort already, go ahead!

Did you go to the computer room when you were 5 years old and start
breaking the things there? When you entered the room you had the common
sense not to break things there didn't you? Similarly, if you are not
qualified enough to do proper pUjA, stick to what you can do. Apart from
this this example is not entirely a good analogy. This is because
smR^iti clearly says wrong performance = bad results. This is not so in
the case of a "Hello, world" program not compiling. If you choose to
disagree with smR^iti, feel free to do it. I don't care.

smR^iti and traditional practice allows for mistakes in pronunciation
etc while LEARNING it. That's why a guru is there top correct you at
once.

I clearly mentioned that it depends on the type of karma. Did you read
my previous posts at all or not? In case of sandhya etc you HAVE to do
it even if imperfectly. In things like shrI chakra pUjA etc you HAVE to
follow the rules.

You don't seem to understand or even read what I wrote. Again, in case
of nitya karma-s not doing it is WORSE than doing it improperly. Read
this sentence carefully and figure out the rest.

First read my previous posts carefully. And what bussiness is it of
yours what I do? I never say what my spiritual practices, except perhaps
people who I consider very close to me. Why, do you plan to take me on
as a guru? :-)

As I said, go ask the people I mentioned, my question. I am betting $500
(raing the stakes) that they'll disagree with your ideas.

Rama.

Anand - your analysis sounds logical and pleasure to read.  I do agree that
vedic mantras have to be chanted with proper intonations - sound and its
vibrations have their own effects on the mind.  So it is better to do it
with proper intonations than without.  More than the intonations, knowing
the meaning and chanting - this includes even the simple sandhyaavandanam,
is far better than doing without knowing the meaning.

Now if one does not know proper intonations ( perticularly those who grow
up in the south and leared the chanting in one way and go to north and
listen to the chanting of the same mantras - one will have a shocking
experience),  it is still better to chant rather than not to chant,
particularly if the mind dwells in the meaning and become contemplative.  I
have a feeling that Lord Naraayana, although may be jarring to his ears,
will be compasionate enough and take the bhakti part and leave the rest.
If it is too unbearable, He will be forced to send a proper teacher to
train his bhakta. But the ball is in His court.

To join you on the lighter side, I have to tell a story published once in
nR^isimaha priya (TTD Publication).

There was once a devoted lady who was chanting daily Mukundamaala
(Kulasekhara virachitam) with full devotion. There is a sloka with the
meaning to the effect  "I surrender at your holy feet".  Somewhere in her
childhood, she learned the sloka wrong with distorted version that has
opposite meaning, " you surrender at my holy feet".  She was enthraaled in
the chaning - Mukundamaala is so devotional, she was fully immersed in the
Krishna Bhakti.  One day One sanskrit pandit happend to be a guest in her
house and after hearing her chanting, he told her what she is doing is a
greatest apachaaram (sin) by chanting wrongly. He  told what it means and
corrected her.  She was devastated after knowing the error she commited,
not once but for all these years - she was crying day and night for the sin
she has been commiting without knowing.

It appears that the Lord Krishna came in the dreams of the Pandit next day
and gave him good thrashing- why should the pandit bother where she is at
Krishna's feet or Krishna is at her feet. Krishna said she is a very
devoted soul  and He loves to be at the feet of such devotees!  So He
directed the pundit to go back to her and tell her that he was mistaken and
that he was wrong in correcting her and what she was doing is right for
her. The pundit had all the burns on the body due to Krishna's thrashing.
To releave the pain he had to rush to the lady in the middle of the night.

After hearing the pandit, the old lady was enthralled and went back to
chaning in her own way immersing herself in the Krishana bhakti.

My final input to this topic is this  - yes things should be done as best
as one can and according to the manuals.  In the final analysis, the
intended result being what it is, the devotee is relieved from unnecessory
mental agitations, if he has the Eswararpita buddi.

- although it is hypothtical, in the  Kanakadaasa story,  if he had known
Purusha suuktam even in a distorted way and chanted immersing in his
devotion, I do not think Krishna would mind.  Ultimately what he cares for
is the devotion and not the chanting per sec.  Without a tint of devotion,
chanting is of little use. That is the reason I quated two B.G. slokas
-patram pushpam and yat karoshi ... in my prvious posts - to say that it is
not my statement but Krishna's from smRiti only.

I have no disagreements only a different perspective.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
