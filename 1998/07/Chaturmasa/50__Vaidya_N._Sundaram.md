 It is an undeniable fact that Bali was a great Bhagavata himself. It is
said that one of the reasons Lord Vishnu assumed the form of a Vamana (a
dwarf like) is that he showed that in front of Bhagavatas he is but like a
dwarf. He could have very well assumed the form of a pious Brahman or any
thing He wished!!

 That said, it is also said that Bali wife Vindhyavali is also a great
devotee herself. After Bali offered puja to the Vamana, she did her puja.
The lord in Guruvayur today, spoke to Naraayan Namoobdri and said that the
water she offered at His feet cool His feet even today!!

 It is also said that Bali knew very well who the Vamana was and His
purpose. That is why even in spite of SukrAcharyar (Bali's Guru) objecting
to Bali giving land to the Vamana, Bali does so.

 Interestingly, there are two other versions of the end. One is that, Lord
Vishnu accepts Bali's inability to fulfill his promise of giving three
steps of land. Hence, Lord Vishnu is now the debtor. (Remember, Bali not
being able to fulfill his promise makes him a debtor!) Then, He creates a
new realm, that of Patala, and makes Bali the ruler. And that He may
absolve himself of the debts (the debts he assumed from Bali), Lord Vishnu
said that he would stand guard at Bali's doorsteps, all of Vaivashwata
manvantaram, and that if during the current manvantaram, the Vaivashwata
manvantaram, one wishes to see Lord Vishnu, they can find Him, not in
Vaikuntam, but in Patalam, at Bali's door.

 The other version is that, Bali wanted to make sure that Indra handles
his people with mercy. So he comes out of Patalam everyday to check on the
welfare of his subjects (one day for the Devas/Asuras is one year for us).
This is the reason people of Kerala celebrate Onam, a show of wealth and
happiness, that Bali may be satisfied that his subjects are still happy.
