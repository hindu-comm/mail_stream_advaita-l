namaste

This is a copy of mail sent to me.Since it does not have anything
personal I am posting it to the forum. I request shrI Murthy to
join back to the list.

One important thing I am learning these days is to stay away from
writing unnecssary stuff. I apologize to shrI Murthy for my
off-topic post in the recent past which hurt his sentiments.,
http://listserv.tamu.edu/cgi/wa?A2=ind9807a&L=advaita-l&O=T&P=1727

I learnt very recently from one of the elders (whom I know)  that
time spent on such things, should be spent constructively in
bhagavat kaiMkaryam.  I will learn to be more objective and to
the point in future.

Subject: retirement from the forum


Dear Shri Ravi,

Namaste.

I have come to the conclusion that my thinking and interpretation of
Shri Shankara in advaita is not suitable to other members, particularly
those who post. Under the circumstances, I think I should retire from
the forum, rather than be a source of continuous uneasiness both to
other members and to me also. Accordingly, I have written to the listserv
to sign me off.

I have enjoyed my two years on the list and learnt a lot. I commend you
for the excellent job you are doing as the list owner. I will try to clarify
my own doubts about advaita either through personal correspondence with
like-minded members or seek some other forum or through books (as I do
continuously).

Regards
Gummuluru Murthy
