namaste

Today is guru pUrNimA or vyAsa pUrNimA.

vyAsAya viShNurUpAya vyAsarUpAya viShNave
namovai brahmanidhaye vAsiShTaya namonamaH

shrImAta is called gurumaNDalarUpiNI and dakShinAmUrtirUpiNi. May SHE
guide us all from  Untruth to Truth, darkness of ignorance to the light of
self-realization, from mortality in the realm of mAyA to immortality of
brahman.


I have finally converted shrI shankara aShTottara shata nAma stotram and
loaded in the incoming directory of jaguar.
It is in
ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/private/sanskrit/incoming/shankara108.ps

I will continue the nAmAvali after some time, I am consolidating what I
have typed and want to complete the meaning of all the names and then post
it to the list.


With respects,
Ravi
