103. hariNekShaNA

SHE who has looks like a deer.

hariNi means deer. SHE has tremulous looks like a deer. Those
looks are out of immense pleasure.

This name can be interpreted in another way. paradevAta looks on
all sides and sees every things. This SHE does out of compassion
for HER children. This is compared to a deer's look because,
deer (in this case out of fear) looks on all sides.
