Just a warning, one should be wary of these popular prayoga books,
particularly if they come from unreliable sources such as Bharatiya Vidya
Bhavan.  For instance does this one mention what Shakha it is for?  The
Vaishvadeva mantras are different for different Shakhas and Sutras.

Vaishvadeva (for "all Gods" or vishva deva) is also called Aupasana Homa.
Every Grhastha is bound to do 5 mahayagnas daily to counteract the small
sins that inevitably accumulate in worldly life.  They are to Devas, Pitrs,
Rshis, Bhutas, and Atithis.  The Vaishvadeva Homa is the offering to
Devas.
