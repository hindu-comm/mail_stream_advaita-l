I assume that Shri Giridhar has similar views to the ones expressed in
this article from the newspaper.  I will take the liberty of adding my
comments to it.

        This is a social problem that has nothing to do with religion at
all. Who doesn't want to be hygienic, clean and economically well-off.
Does "Hinduism" preach that a man should not be any of these?

        It is indeed amusing to read this paragraph. sanAtna dharma has
the intent and the capacity to protect the human being from the falsity
that the mind creates. And now the "followers" of the "Hindu" dharma are
so righteous and so great that they will protect the dharma from being
harmed. Personally, this is a ridiculous attitude that has lead to as much
"harm" as its absence might have done.

        Perhaps the only sensible thing written in this article.

        Notice that nobody talks about improving the situation, of
removing inconveniences so that culture can flourish. They all talk about
 some doomsday predictions.

        Sometime ago an article from the Hindu was submitted to the list,
for perusal of course.  I remember the issue of copyright violations
coming up then, and it being recommended that no such articles be posted
on the list. I just hope that Shri Giri's posting doesn't fall under that
category.

Prashant.
