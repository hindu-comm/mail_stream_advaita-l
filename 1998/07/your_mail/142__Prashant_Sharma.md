        I did not comment on this because there is nothing like
a non-material ambition. Even for what people call a "spiritual" ambition
one needs some material things for which one has to work (like building an
"ashram", or even a residence). So you can't just live without material
ambitions, unless one is a sannyAsi.  But then we are not talking about
such great people. Also I am not talking about jnAnis like
BhagvAn RAmana here who have *no* ambition but about people like us. For
example I am here in the US to do a PhD in theoretical physics. It has
some material contents to it of course, since it will lead me to a job
(well, hopefully :-) even though what I am doing is just trying to make a
few theories to explain certain natural phenomenon, hardly materialistic.

        And have you read about rAmakrishna paramhansa saying that
religion is not for people who are starving? Or have you anywhere read
that he was advocating living in as miserable a condition as the poorest
folks in West Bengal were living in those days and asking that people learn to
live like that?
I have spent the last 20 odd years of my life in Banaras, its only in the
last three years that I have had to move out for my PhD to Boston.  And I
see much of the attitude reflected in this article prevailing in that city
and really hindering basic necessities of life being provided to people.
Please realise that for an average  Indian, economically well-off means
making both ends meet. It is rather unfortunate that learning to live with
less materials is as much an effort (mentally) as is learning to live with
more. There is an optimum balance somewhere, but it is to be arrived at by
experimentation and not prescription. One has to understand that given a
social structure that no longer supports a brAhmaN for performing priestly
duties, it becomes necessary for that person to contribute materially to
the society.  Of course, you might take the view point that a person
should live on alms no matter what they get, to which I can only say that
such people belong to a different category and neither the person who has
written that article nor the readers belong to this class. So why are we
talking about them.  This is not to say that I dont know of such a person,
for one will find, if he seeks, such great souls (atleast in Banaras). But
such people do not have any conflict of interests like we are having. They
are least concerned about whether the culture or the "hindU" dharma is
being harmed by NRIs making big money and pumping it into the country or
taking it away, whichever be the case.

        Dont you think that as long as there is *somebody* living a life
it shall always be antithetical to moksha?

        I responded to the newspaper article that you had appended to your
full mail.  That article dealt only with how NRI's and RI's are harming
the hindU culture by trying to be clean and economically well-off.  It
had no quotes from any Acharyas nor any talk about fate and free-will. I
fail to see the reason why you are asking me these questions.  Infact I
dont see any quote  from the Acharyas, the newspaper article was
trying to support.  Other than saying that what most NRIs think is "hindU"
culture is not so and that in someway this attitude is harming that true
culture which is preserved by not thinking about cleanliness and
economics, the newspaper article serves no purpose.  It gives little
reason and no logic to justify this claim. My comments, therefore, are of
the same character.

        Unfortunately, I do spend a lot of time reading articles from
atleast 4 Indian newspapers, once in a week.  The nobody refers to many
such cynics (there are many such social workers and politicians, I can
name them if you want me to, but I want to spare this list of these
issues) who have the idea that hindU culture is all about doing nothing.
I can list you many (enough to keep you busy for a day atleast) foreign
documentaries on India that use such statements to put forth there
doomsday hypothesis.  The nobody doesnot mean no single person.  I have
been well aware of some social organisations that help improve conditions
in India for quite sometime now.

        Ravi was kind enough to send me a mail educating me on this
matter.  I have since, stopped worrying about it.
