Namaste.

It is nice to see that things are back to normal after the minor
turbulence. It may be in context to make one observation.

The objective of the group is to arrive at the truth. As Shri RamaNa
Maharshhi repeatedly said in many of His teachings, we can experience
the truth, not by intellectual discussions, but by purity of heart.
However much of intellectual discussions - whether they be on
GauDapAda-Shankara advaita or Buddha-NAgArjuna bouddhism - does not
matter. Obviously, from the tone of the messages of the past day, the
prerequisite seems to be there (the maximum proportion of purity of
heart and the desire to understand the truth).

Regards
Gummuluru Murthy

When all the desires that dwell in the heart fall away, then the mortal
becomes immortal, and attains Brahman even here.
