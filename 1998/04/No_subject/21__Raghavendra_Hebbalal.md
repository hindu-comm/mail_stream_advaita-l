namaste,
              I have been a shrOta on the list. I get to learn a lot
from the
arguments which occur. As Sri  Jaldhar rightly pointed out, even our
Acharyas
bhasHyas contains pUrva paksha arguments which are then refuted. By such

arguments, certain doubts which existed before the debate get clarified.
It
also helps one to get a new perspective.
           I would therefore ask Sri Ram Chandran and Sri Nanda to
reconsider
their decision on signing off from the list.
Thank you,
Raghavendra.
