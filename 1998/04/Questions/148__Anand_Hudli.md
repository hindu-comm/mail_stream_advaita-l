 I sympathize with your doubts. Advaita, unlike purely theological
 systems, encourages us to use our intellect to discern the truth.
 But the important distinction between advaita and purely intellectual
 approaches is that in advaita all reasoning is to be guided by what
 is the called the shruti, Vedanta or the upanishads which form the
 basis of the system. Reasoning independent of the Shruti can only
 point out that advaitic conclusions are plausible, not certain.
 As you have rightly pointed out, conclusions contrary to advaita
 may also be similarly plausible, provided we take the purely
 intellectual approach. As such, reasoning independent of some kind
 of a prop or arbiter, such as the Shruti, will be inconclusive and
 doubts will always remain.

 For most Westerners, the difficult thing to understand is that
 advaita is not established on grounds of logical inference alone,
 although logic plays a crucial role, far more crucial than you see
 in many other systems.   One should not forget that Advaita is also
 a system based on the exegesis of Vedanta.
 Thus the sources of knowledge,
 apart from perception and inference which form the bed-rock of
 all means to knowledge of the material world, also include the
 testimony of the Vedas/Vedanta. In this connection there was
 disussion here about the precise role of the means of knowlegde in
 advaita. Please see, for example, (in the archives)

 You may also search the archives for similar articles.

 Now, an objection may be raised: By making the intellectual approach
 depend on the Shruti, advaita is trying to suppress the inquisitive
 spirit of the seeker of Truth. In reply, advaita would say that
 truth is not reached by using the intellect alone. What is needed
 is a wholistic approach that combines intellectual inquiry with moral
 behaviour and virtues, faith in the Guru and Shruti, dispassion,
 right discrimination, and a desire for liberation.
