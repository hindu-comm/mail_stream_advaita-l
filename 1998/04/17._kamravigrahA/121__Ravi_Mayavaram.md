17. kamravigrahA

Entrancing image - kamra means bewitching - vigraha means image. HER
form or mUrti is most entrancing with attributes such as profundity,
fortitude, and sweetness.

Ananda rUpam amR^itam yadvibhAti (Mu-U 2-27)  - That which is shining
as bliss and immortality; As mentioned in the above shruti, having the
form of bliss SHE is entrancing.
