Greetings Anand:

Though you have stated that I am wrong, I  assume that you just diasgree
with what I said.   We  agree and disagree with our family members  and
will not disrupt any healthy relationship.It is human nature to agree
and disagree.  This is also a part of human weekness.

The questions that I have raised are just hypothetical  but they are
real and  they could come from someone who is not familiar with Hindu
traditions and Sankara's various writings.  Such a person is likely
utter confused because he/she may not understand  the subtle
connections.  The whole purpose of this list is to remove ignorance and
to help members to a right path of life.   The point that I have raised
in my posting is to help Ravi to understand the complexity of  different
issues so that he can prepare a policy with a broader scope.   This is
definitely not a criticism against you for posting such a fine
article.   I was rather surprised that an intelligent and scholarly
person like you to become emotional  and make unnecessary accusations
and subjective judgments of my behavior.  I have directly and implicitly
indicated that I liked your article. I  honestly wanted to make sure
that these articles should have a place under the new guidelines come
into effect.

I am sorry to say that several of  your statments are unnecessarily
harsh and could have been avoided.   I have no control over your
opinions  and your judgements.   I always believed that you are an
intelligent and scholarly person and  I will continue to believe the
same.  If  think that I am responsible for your misunderstanding,   I
want to apologize to you for my imprecise writing style.   With the
Grace of God, I hope to continue to keep a good opinion of you.

I just wanted to make point and I have made my point and I want to leave
and live in peace.

Regards,

Greetings Kartik:

When I was at your age,  I used to laugh at my grandmother when she gave
examples to make her point.  Now I have a son at your age and I am
laughing at my self over my childhood laughs.
Besides intelligent and knowledgeable people,  the world also contains
less intelligent and ignorant people.  People in this list come with
different culture and traditions and the purpose of this list is to
learn from each other.  Two other Advaitic traditions that I am familiar
are the following:
(1) Listen carefully, contemplate and do not jump into conclusions.
(2) Be kind and compassionate to less fortunate and  be polite and
respectful.

Let me give a real incident to make my point.  Chinmaya Mission conducts
study groups where members participate and discuss Vedantic philosophies
at different levels.  People who participate in those study groups
consist of people of all ages and intellectual maturity.  When we
discuss Sankara's famous example of the Snake and Rope, the discussants
raise lots of questions.   Mostly those questions come from those who
are young and/or new to the study group.  Some of them do not hesitate
to laugh and joke at the Snake and Rope example.  Those who laughed in
the beginning became the most serious seekers of TRUTH after few years!
The Snake and the monster are our own creations but we can't realize
this TRUTH by laughing but  by contemplation and knowledge.

Adi Sankara when he proposed the Advaitic Philosophy to the Orthodox
Traditional People that time, they also laughed at him!  Sankara has to
spend lots of his time to educate and convince them to accept his
philosophy.  In conclusion, I am not concerned about your laughs and I
am sure at a later time, you will laugh at yourself over your laughs.  I
make this statement sincerely because I believe that you are an
intelligent and knowledgeable person with a sense of dedication to find
the Truth.  Your presence and your past contributions to this list
support my contention.

Wish you all the best in your pursuit of Truth.

Regards,

Greetings Vaidya:

I agree with your disagreement because I am fully aware of all those
connections.  I just raised this as a hythetical issue to help Ravi.  I
am not dogmatic but I just expressed my concerns on potential
misunderstandings.  All these clarifications from you, Anand, Jaldhar
and Karthik will help the list members to understand the issues on
clearer terms.  I appreciate your concern and thank you for your
comments.

Regards,
