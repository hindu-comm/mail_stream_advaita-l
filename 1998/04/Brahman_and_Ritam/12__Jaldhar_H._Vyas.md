No, not even by the low standards of the modernists.  Rta complements the
idea of Dharma and perhaps a case could be made that the idea of Dharma
was previous to the idea of Brahman but even this is pure speculation.
For one thing, Brahman is mentioned in the Samhitas.  And the upanishads
do not in any way try to replace the idea of Dharma.

It is true that Vedantic ideas were _systematically_ organized later.  The
Brahmasutras were written by Maharshi Vedavyas to explain the Vedas so
obviously they had to exist before.  But I don't see how that makes the
Veda themselves any less "intellectual" just unorganized.
