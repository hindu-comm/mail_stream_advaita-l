right meaning "correct" as well law (as in human rights.)  Not to mention
rite as in religious ritual.

And it hasn't been derived from Sanskrit.  Both English and Sanskrit
derive from some proto-Indo-European language.

In this case rta just means correct.  This just means worship should be
offered according to the correct methods.  (And "correct method" is what
rta means in Gujarati today.  Probably other modern languages too.)

Putting the ultimate there is stretching it.  There is little reaon to
connect rta with Brahman on such flimsy evidence.

Foreigners and foreign translations distort meanings.  It's best to avoid
them.
