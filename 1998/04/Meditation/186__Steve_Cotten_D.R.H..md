Aloha,
    Ramana Maharshi solved this one for me. I concentrated on the "I"
thought and it led me deeper to the experience of "beingness" or just
"Awareness". That is the real me. When I'm just "being" I'm not thinking nor
am I experiencing. I'm just being.....Happiness! That's me... Happiness! I
do it all the time even when I'm not meditating and I'm so grateful to RM
for pointing the way home.

Aloha,
Steve

(Aloha means Love by the way)
