For quite a while now I've been trying meditation. Initially I used to
try concentrating on some particular object in my mind and try to not
let me mind waver. Then as per Ramana Maharishi's advice I took a deep
breath, got a good hold of my basic 'I' feeling and tried not to let my
mind wander.

Lately I've trying to concentrate on my "I" feeling, plumbing the depths
of my being and trying to discern what it is. Then it struck me that if
the basic "I" feeling is itself me and the true seer how can the "I"
know itself? As Sage Yaganavalka questions in  Brhadaranyaka Upanishad,
"How can the knower itself be known?". So  does it mean "I" can't know
"I", but "I" should try concentrating on knowing what's not the "I"?

Easier said than done! At present, I'm not even able to distinguish my
body from my "I"! :-)

Any ideas?

Also can someone suggest some good books on meditation?
