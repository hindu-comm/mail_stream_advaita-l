Not even intellectually?

How about this technique:  If you are aware of your body, then YOU -- that
is, what is aware of the body -- cannot be the body.  This also goes for
the mind, intellect, or any other object of consciousness.  For all X, if X
arises in consciousness, then you cannot be X.  Why not?  Simply because
you are aware of X, so you're different from X.  What is then left?  Pure
consciousness Itself.
