Denying that any such thing occurs of course Vedanta fails to take it into
account.

I find it difficult to believe you are more mentally evolved than
Shankaracharya.

It's being applied without modifications this very day.

Not really.

Not surprising considering there wasn't a nation.

History cannot concur with this view.  First of all Shankaracharya was not
teaching anything new.  He mentions several predecessors of which
Gaudapadacharya two generations before is the most obvious example.
Secondly Hindu society as a whole was hardly deteriorating.  This was also
the age of Kumarila Bhatt and Mandana Mishra.  Thirdly Buddhism remained
vigorous for several centuries after this time.

Another untenable view.  Vedic ritualism (not to mention Tantra which is
also a feature of Buddhism) remained vigorous throughout the Buddhist era.

I'm not going to address the rest of your message as it is off-toic for
this list. ;-)
