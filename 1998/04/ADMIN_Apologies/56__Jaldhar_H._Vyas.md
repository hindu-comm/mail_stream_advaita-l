What I have to say may not make sense at first (it didn't to me :-) but
bear with me and read to the end and I hope you can see what I mean.

Just because someone takes a fancy to the name advaita doesn't mean they
are entitled to it.  After all Vallabha called his doctrine Shuddhadvaita.
His main quarrel with Shankaracharya is with the doctrine of maya but
other than that he mainly agrees.  Should he be included?  How about the
right-wing crowd who have recently taken power in India?  They invoke
Advaita concepts in the name of "national integration." Should they be
included?

It is exaggeration in the extreme to call what they practice a
"tradition."  Most of these people are vague and mixed up in their own
doctrines let alone Shankaracharyas.

There is some tradition that Advaita belongs with Buddhism (at least if
you believe Anand Tirth etc!)  Let's look at what the doctrines of Advaita
Vedanta themselves say and use them as a yardstick to measure the
newcomers.  They fall far short of the mark in most cases.

The same can be said of the pseudo-Vedantins.  It seems for the most part
they and their followers only pay lip service to Advaita teachings or
worse follow them when it suits their fancy and ignore them when they find
it inconvenient.  I don't know many learned people who have much respect
for that either.

I don't think he would have been any less critical of people who believe
mystic experiences are more important than Vedic testimony, karma and
jnana are anything less than completely seperate, or women and foreigners
are entitled to study the upanishads.

But there _are_ apparent similiarities between Vedanta and Buddhism.  It
may be a mistake but it is an easy mistake to make.  That's precisely why
the topic should be kept in the open where it can by answered instead of
being allowed to fester.  Lately most of the posts relating to Buddhism
have been posted by Nanda Chandran (and it's hardly the only topic he's
asked about) who stated he was exploring the relationship between Buddhism
and Vedanta and not endorsing Buddhism.  I fail to see what is wrong with
this.

I agree but the same goes for the modernists.  A lot of their followers
blindly follow them without realizing they are being led astray.  They are
led to believe Shankaracharya only made some suggestions about Advaita
instead of laying down doctrine.

What hasn't been an influence on these people?  They have taken some
aspects of Advaita doctrines and mixed it up with all sorts of things:
Buddhism, new Age stuff, Max Muller, "modern science", and who knows what.
Ramakrishna _mission_ and Chinmaya _mission_  don't sound like they got
their influences from Indian culture.  Have you been to the RK mission in
New York?  The place looks like a church!

I'm sure there are individual people in those groups, both teachers and
students who are quite orthodox but there are also many of them who are
not.  This is an inevitable consequence of their lack of discipline and
intellectual rigor.

The point of all I wrote is this.  The new schools are in fact in exactly
the same position vis-a-vis Advaita Vedanta as the Buddhists.  If you're
going to ban discussion of one, you ought to ban discussion of the other.
Overall it is far better to allow both, see the good parts and try and
remove the bad.  And to determine what is good and bad only the shastras
are a faithful guide.
