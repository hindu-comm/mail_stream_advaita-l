On reading your post I realized I didn't know off hand where the archives
were located.  So perhaps listserv could append some lines like this to
each post:

Before starting a new topic check to see if it hasn't already been
discussed at the list archive http://listserv.tamu.edu/archives/advaita-l.html

or something like that.  Along with a FAQ, this will be educational, help
stay on-topic and not place a burden on the list admins.
