    I am curious to know how the western view interprets the state of being
when there is *no* distinction between the observer and the observed. When
even the notion of *I am* is not there for an individual.

    If by self-realization you mean the same as "moksha" then it is *not*
an attitude, nor simply an experience but a state of being.  If you
appreciate the fact that what ever we experience is in the realm of our
knowledge (which is why experiences have to be given words to describe
them) then "moksha" is not in the realm of our knowledge.   Which is the
reason for the scriptures to insist that it cannot even be described in
words.  The fact that western view point never gives importance to anything
that is outside the realm of human knowledge implies that it is forced to
interpret this state of being  as some new biological method of
functioning, thereby denying the importance of *advaita* as the substratum
of life as we know it.

    This whole thing is inconsistent.  One suffers and yet  intellectually
reasons that one does notsuffer.  Isn't this inconsistent?

      I don't know if you realise that there is no "you" when there is no
ego/mind/body.   The way one functions is what is this ego/mind/body
complex.  When one is aspiring for "moksha" he is asserting that he will
discard all that he is, all his relationships, everything that the world
knows him to be.  That is why it is so difficult even to be an aspirant for
"moksha".  The requirements (and you will find them stated in Adi
SankrAchArya 's works) are indeed extreme.  Infact I will not even get a
10% grade on that quiz if I were to take it, and although it is highly
presumptuous to speak about others, it is unlikely that many people on this
list would score a 100%.  And indeed one has to die in order to achieve
moksha (it has been described by sages as akin to physical death), with the
difference that there is *no* rebirth.  The "I" is dead once and for all
and whatever remains (necessarily being the substratum on which the "I"
existed) is immortal.

Can you throw some more light on this statement? I have just posted a
request to ravi for assistance on which order should I take up study of
Sankaracharya's teachings.
