Moksha undermines the Western view utterly and effortlessly
because it undermines *all* views, including Vedantic.
"Views" are only a means or strategy for arriving at the
Substratum Self or Absolute Being.   Whatever view is adopted,
is likened to a thorn that's used to pluck another thorn out of
the skin, and when the job is done, both are discarded.

Namaste.
