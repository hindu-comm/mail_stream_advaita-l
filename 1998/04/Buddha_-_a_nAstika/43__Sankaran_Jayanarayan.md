The Bhagavatam and Vishnu Purana are similar in their accounts of Vishnu
deluding the asuras by appearing before them as Buddha (not unlike the
Mohini avatar.)

Shankara does not quote this part, but when commenting on Buddhism,
declares,"By establishing three mutually contradictory doctrines (the
madhyamika, the hinayana, and the vijnanavada), the Buddha either
revealed his own incoherent talkativeness or his enmity towards the
jivas, by attempting to cause confusion among them."

So we have good testimony from Shankara himself that what Buddha taught
is certainly not advaita :-)
