namaskAram

What you said about the advaita guru paramapara is correct. It starts
before shankara. Anand posted a nice article on this along with
toTakAshhTakam long back.

I know that shrImad bhagavadam (at least the copies I have seen)
refers to Buddha as one of the avatars. I dont know about vishhNu
puranam. I have read only a tamil translation of it long back when I
was in eighth standard. I dont  remember a great deal of it. That is
why I added "even if". I may be wrong on this, but I still wonder
whether shrIman nArAyaNA, who establishes dharma time and again, will
come in to confuse the masses. Does shankara quote the portion which
refers to buddha?
