According to the Bhagavata Purana, the Asuras after being beaten in yet
another round of their perennial conflict with the Devas, had an idea.
Observing that they kept losing because the Devas were armed with Dharma
they decided to give up Adharma and become "holier than thou" as it were.
Sure enough they began to prevail.  In distress, Indra etc. appealed to
Vishnu Bhagawan to save them which he did by becoming the Buddha and
confusing them with heretical thoughts.  Unfortunately, as a byproduct
some humans accidently got affected to.

Not much of a compliment is it?

Because nowadays Samkhya doesn't exist as a seperate darshan having being
amalgamated with Yoga.  Samkhya-Yoga adds Ishwar as a tattva to the
original 25 of Samkhya bringing it back into the pale.  Also Samkhya-Yoga
has more or less been assimilated into Vedanta.

Things change.  In Gujarat Jains are completely integrated into the Hindu
community and apart from a few scholars, both they and their neighbors
would be astonished to learn they are nastikas!  On the other hand a lot
of todays so-called Advaitins deserve the term.

It was their theories that made them nastika!

Not necessarily.  If Buddhism had really been assimilated (the way Jainism
was) it would still exist in India today.
