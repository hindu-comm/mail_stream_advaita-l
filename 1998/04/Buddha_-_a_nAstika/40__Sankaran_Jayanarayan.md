Perhaps so.

Undoubtedly, Shankara's influence on the tradition of advaita is great,
but you should remember that advaitins also consider Veda Vyasa,
Parashara, Shuka, Jada Bharata to be advaitins who propounded the
philosophy of advaita (as taught by Shankara). Even Ramana Maharshi once
said that everyone ought to read the story of JaDa Bharata.

According to tradition, one must learn from a Guru and completely
respect his opinions on any issue. By the very fact that we choose to
learn from a computer and the internet implies a very serious defect in
our learning process. Which among the members of the advaita-L mailing
list can claim to be an authority on the scriptures, let alone being
capable of teaching others? I trust not a single person on this list can
make that claim. I would say that most, if not all, the members in this
list are themselves in need of guidance from a Guru.

This being the case, would you not accept that for a clear understanding
of the scriptures, one must logically scritinize it? In fact, if one
felt that it is not required, one might as well stop discussing the
scriptures and unsubscribe from this list. Naturally, a reverential
attitude towards the scriptures and the members of the list ought to be
maintained.

That Buddha was one of the avatars is far from debatable. Both the
Vishnu Purana and the Srimad Bhagavatam accept him as one of the avatars
of Vishnu, though both of them say that the avatar was in disguise and
misled the masses. Moreover, the statement in the thiruviLaiyaDal
purAnam does not contradict this. And I doubt that advaitins would
consider the thiruviLaiyaDal purAnam as a more authoritative text than
the Vishnu Purana. In fact, even Shankara quotes from the Vishnu Purana.

I think you should think a little more regarding this point. You say
that the definition of advaita-vedanta is what Shankara taught. Perhaps
you have forgotten about GauDapaada, Shankara's paramaguru, who uses the
word "advaita" to denote his philosophy for the first time, in his
commentary on the MANDUkya upanishad, which means that his philosophy is
advaita vedaanta.

I think it is height of narrow-mindedness to say that this forum ought
not to allow for debate in any form. I would agree that this forum
shouldn't allow for debates on topics like how to buy a used car, etc.,
but you must allow for topics on which people are striving for a better
understanding of the scriptures.
