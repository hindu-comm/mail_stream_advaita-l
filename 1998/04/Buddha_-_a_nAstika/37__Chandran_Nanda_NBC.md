About Buddha being nAstika, one would then wonder why he's worshipped by
Hindus as an avatar of Lord Vishnu! In the Brahma Sutras Badarayana
terms the Samkhya school as nAstika. But now it's considered Astika!

Wonder where the distinction begins and ends and what purpose it serves!
Does Gaudapada dismiss the Madhyamikas merely because they're nAstika
and ignore their theories? The Gaudapadiya karika is more addressed
towards them than the Vedantins. For the traditional Hindu way is not
mere dismissal of the opponent on disagreement, but to meet the rival on
his own grounds and assimilate.
