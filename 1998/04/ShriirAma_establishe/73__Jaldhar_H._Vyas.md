Not so!  It is an unfortunate misconception that Shankaracharya was not
concerned with or even against Bhakti and conventional religion.  In fact
while he says Jnana and Jnana alone can be the cause of Moksha, this path
is only for those who have taken sannyasa.  For the rest, adherence to
Dharmic duties such as going to tirths and mandirs are not just an
optional extra they are the law!  Not to mention other great figures like
Swami Madhusudan Saraswati and Shri Bhaskararaya have also promoted Bhakti
and Karma without giving an inch on the topic of Jnana.

In another post I am about to make a similiar argument however there is
one crucial difference.  As Anand pointed out Buddhism is anti-Vedic while
Shri Rama is certainly not.  As Vedantins, it is the Vedas and their
descendant shastras, and the tradition that flows from them which is the
criterion for judging suitability.

Things will probably become clearer when Ravi posts his FAQ.
