 I apologize to you for making some harsh statements yesterday.
 This is what happens when we come under the sway of the ego.

 On being emotional about this Buddhism, I think it is wise not be
 so, either way. I do not have anything against Buddhism in itself.
 It is only for what I think is the benefit of the list members that
 I felt necessary to concentrate on advaita, and not extraneous
 issues. It is also not necessary to learn anything about Buddhism or
 any other doctrine in order to be able to understand advaita.

 Most of the prakaraNa granthas written by Shankara and others keep
 it plain and simple, by teaching just advaita Vedaanta. So we do
 not lose anything by not discussing, say Confucius, in the context
 of advaita.

 You have given the example of how questions may be asked by students
 in a classroom discussion. I have myself taught at a university
 before. It is common practice and not considered as stifling anyone
 to ask a student whose questions do not pertain to the class topic to
 meet after the class and discuss them in private. This does not
 mean the student is being insulted or anything. It is only to keep
 a proper focus in the classroom. I hope I have made myself clear.

 Again, I am sorry for making some harsh statements yesterday which
 were not necessary.

 Anand
