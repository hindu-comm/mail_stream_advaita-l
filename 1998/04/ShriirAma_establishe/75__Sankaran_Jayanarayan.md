Shankara quotes from the RAmAyaNa in his upadeshasahasrii and hails RAma
as a self-realized soul and encourages the disciples to be like RAma.
Any article about someone considered worthy of worship by Shankara is
good enough for the members of this list. The entire article was about
one of the temples that is considered sacred by the advaita tradition.

:-) You need to free yourself from your self-imposed knots. I think you
must think a little clearer.

I have to laugh! There is no monster. It's your imagination playing
tricks. Just like MAyA :-)

I agree with you and I am also hopeful Ravi's FAQ posting will resolve
these issues.
