The reason I brought this up is because this is one of the arguments made
by opponents.  If what is conventionally called seeing is false, how can
we ever know there is such an entity as brahman at all?  It seems to them
that the best an Advaitin can hope to achieve is a kind of agnosticism.
Needless to say this is not good enough.

While "neti neti" etc. may suggest otherwise advaita Vedanta is quite
optimistic that Truth can be known in a positive way.
