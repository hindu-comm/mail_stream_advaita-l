12.  kandarpavidyA

The vidyA or mantra of kandarpa. It means the knowledge of unity
between individual self [jIva] and Universal Self [Brahman] which is
established by the mantra whose seer is kandarpa; or just as some
vedic sentences are called upaniShads, this mantra (panchadashI) which
is a combination of letters revealed to kandarpa since it confers
knowledge is called vidyA. This vidya expresses paradevatA only.
