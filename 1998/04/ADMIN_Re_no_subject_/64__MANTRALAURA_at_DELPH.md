sarvebhyo namaH,
  I agree with Shrii Sadananda and others that
Advaita Vedanta encompasses every part of our
lives which includes reasonable debates. BTW,
"p~anchadashii" gives several debates from other
religious viewpoints. You might want to check it
out.
  So, I hope that noone really signs off over these
disagreements. We all can modify our responses
so as not to offend anyone.

dhanyavaadaH,
  Mantralaura
