23. ekAnekAkSharAkR^itiH

(eka aneka akShara AkR^itiH )

SHE has the form of one and many. akShara, i.e., ajnAna, with
reference to Ishvara; it is the limitation (upAdhi) primarily of pure
satva; aneka means many akShara or ajnAna i.e., jIvas. They have
limitation of impure satva. nR^isiMha tApinI upaniShad says
mAyachAvidyAcha svaymeva bhavati - mAyA and avidyA came into existence
themselves.

mAyAntu prakR^itiM vi.ndhyAt : mAyA should be known as prakR^iti
(shvetAshvatAropaniShad 4-10). The reflections in both these akSharas,
of awareness are HER so many forms, or AkR^itis. These are like the
reflections of AkAsha or sky in water in many pots. SHE is that
awareness; or eka means letters such as praNava - aneka means
alphabet beginning with a and ending with kSha. SHE has the AkR^iti or
form of all those , i.e., SHE is mAtR^ikA according to the saying
akArAdi kShakArnta mAtR^iketya bhidhIyate. The letters from a to kSha
are known as mAtR^ikA; or eka means the letters e and ka. They, along
with aneka i.e., many other letters form the fifteen lettered mUla
vidyA or mantra which is HER from. Or, as one witness in many akSharas
are ajnAnas, SHE is the essential unity of tat tvam established by
examining them.
