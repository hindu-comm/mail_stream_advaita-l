This is why it will be a terrible tragedy if Ravi continues with the
present course of action.

I was born in England and have lived outside India all my life.  I could
easily have fallen down the wrong path myself if it hadn't been for the
support and guidance I got from my parents and teachers. I also asked
exactly the same kind of questions and engaged in the same kind of debates
as we see here.  If I know a little or a lot today it is because people
took the time to teach facts and correct errors.  It is only because of
them I can do the same for others.

If debate is stifled we are cutting Vedanta off at the roots and no matter
how good our intentions, unwittingly aiding its destruction.
