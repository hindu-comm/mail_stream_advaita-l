We sure can. On the other hand without proper study we can also keep
practicing according to our own ideas and end up going in circles. Both are
necessary, proper knowledge and its translation into pracitcal life. Proper
knowledge is the foundation on which sadhana needs to be built. But the
foundation alone will not be of value, of course. Intense sadhana is
indispensable.

I don't think this comparison really works. Study with shraddha
cannot be called *digging* at the foundation. It is building work. Of course
study does not mean intellectually taking apart everything. That is the
digging work. Then the time has to come when one has found the conviction
and the
study builds our viveka and nourishes the sadhana.
