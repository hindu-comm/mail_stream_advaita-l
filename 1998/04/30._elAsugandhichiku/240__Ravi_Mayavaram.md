30. elAsugandhichikurA

HER coiffure* is fragrant like cardamom. "elAsugandhi" means
'smelling like cardamom'.  By the term "elAsugandhi" smell of
uncreated divine perfume is implied and not the smell of ordinary
cardamom. Because, "mAyA" the creatrix of all is under the control of
Ishwara (hence dependence or likening to something under the creation
of mAyA, is not correct). HER coiffure does not have the fragrance of
cardamom. But it is fragrant like cardamom. Fragrance is the only
similarity between the "elA" and "chikura". The name means SHE has
divinely perfumed hair. Here chikura is indicative of all HER body
which has a natural divine fragrance.
