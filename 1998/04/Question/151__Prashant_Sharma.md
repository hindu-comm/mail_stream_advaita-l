  That the immediate sense of self awareness  is a biological product is
not being denied by Advaita VedAnta.  What it does deny is that this
consciusness is some absolute eternal entity.  The Self, to which intellect
points, is not a biological product at all. This is best appreciated (IMO)
by reading the BrhadAraNyaka Upanishad, especially the dialogue between the
sage yAjnavalkya and his wife MaitreyI. When MaitreyI asks if she can ever
be immortal, the sage points out the meaningless nature of the question.
In replying to MaitreyI's question regarding the nature of the eternal
Self, the sage proceeds by first giving examples that are illustrative of
unification or dissolution .  In so doing he shows that the universe is
nothing but Brahman.  Finally the sage describes the Self in the following
way : "As a lump of salt thrown into water only dissolves into water and
none of it can be picked up, but water everywhere acquires a saline taste,
so this endless reality is only homogeneous intelligence.  On account of
the bodily elements, the self stands out seperately, and as soon as these
are destroyed, its seperate existence is also destroyed.  After attaining
isolation it has no particular consciousness".
     Further light is shed on the nature of Self in the debates between
yAjnavalkya and gArgI, UddyAlaka and other sages.  In all these debates the
Self is defined by denying it attributes.

      Can the mind desist from asking the question "how " it works? It
cannot.  Therefore, how  can the materialist view point be correct if it
cannot answer all the questions?  Advaita VedAnta  promises to answer all
questions that the mind raises in such a way that all the questions are
'burned' in its brightness -- they are answered once and for all and never
arise again.  Therefore, it is the only truth.
