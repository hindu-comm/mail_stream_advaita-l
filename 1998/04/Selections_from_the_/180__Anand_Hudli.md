 The "I" with no upAdhi's (limitations) is indeed th Brahman or
 Atman. I remember having read in one of the advaitic works, but
 can't remember exactly where, that the closest one comes to
 recognizing the real "I" in the vyAvahArika reality is when one
 feels one has experienced deep sleep, dreamless sleep. But as I
 said, this is the closest recognition, not the exact reacognition.

 JIva is the Brahman/Atman with upAdhis. Again these upAdhi's are
 caused by avidyA or ignorance. If you ask why the ignorance arises,
 advaita says it in inexplicable or anirvachanIyA. Please also bear
 in mind that in the pAramArthika state there will be no ignorance.
 Which means, ignorance really does not exist. There is no jIva and
 no Ishvara (God) in the pAramArthika state.

 No. The Self is only _apparently_ being misled as you have said. So
 the Self is really the same, unchanging, eternally free, without even
 a trace of ignorance. So there is no real contradiction here.

 The jIva is Brahman with some limitations caused by ignorance.
 So removing the limitations of the jIva, does not mean nothing or
 a void remains after the disappearance of illusion. What remains
 is Brahman.

 The jIva is _in_essence_ Brahman only, not an illusion. This is a
 central doctrine of vedAnta. The jIva however is affected by
 ignorance. After the removal of ignorance, the jIva finds itself
 as Brahman.

 Atman is real at all levels. It is never negated.

>the Jiva?

 I think there is some confusion here. Please see what I said above
 about the jIva.

 If building a bridge means one can experience both the pAramArthika
 and vyAvahArika levels at the same time, that is clearly impossible.
 That would mean one has to be subjected to illusion and yet realize
 Brahman at the same time. That is a contradiction.

 Regarding the definition of the three levels of reality, please see

http://listserv.tamu.edu/cgi/wa?A2=ind9607B&L=advaita-l&D=0&H=0&T=1&O=D&F=&P=1369

 You may also want to read (at least the introductory part) of the
 vedAnta paribhAShA. The vedAnta-sAra of sadAnanada is also a
 excellent introduction to advaita-vedAnta. You will find material
 on jIva, Ishvara, and a lot more.

 Anand
