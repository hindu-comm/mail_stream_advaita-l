        I hope this doesn't intervene in the ongoing debate with Sri
Ananda. I would like to point out that the "I" that is actually the
sat-chit-Ananda is not the one that is being affected by illusion. All
that we perceive ourselves to be, based on our memory, that *is* the
illusion.  When that disappears what is left is sat-chit-Ananda, which is
the substratum on which the illusion is based. This illusion arises
because of mAyA.

Regards,
Prashant.
