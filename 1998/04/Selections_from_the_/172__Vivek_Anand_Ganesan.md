   I have some questions regarding this.

1) Is what you call "vikAra" also called "parinAma"?
    Because, I have read that the two theories that support a "real"
transformation of the Brahman in to Jagam are :
   a) vivArta - Irreversible change.
   b) parinAma - Reversible change.
  But, the philosophical position of Advaita with regards to this is
actually ajAti-vAda which only supports "apparent" transformation.  Is
this correct?

2) If Advaita does uphold ajAti-vAda, what is the role of mAya in this
doctrine?

3) Finally, how does ajAti-vAda differ from sAtkarya-vAda of shrI
RAmanujAcharyA?

Thanks,

-Vivek.
