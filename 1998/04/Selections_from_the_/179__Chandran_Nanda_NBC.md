Anand please bear with me! I'm trying very hard to understand this.

You say the jiva is the name, form and the upadhi's imposed on the Self.


1. What does the "I" in it's most basic sense without the ego and the
mind represent? Does the Self also form part of it's composition?

2. Or is the concept something like - As the world is an illusion
projected by Brahman, so is this Jiva an illusion projected by the
Atman.

If case 1 is true, that would mean that the Self is being misled by the
mind, ego and the Upadhis. Then wouldn't it contradict the eternal
nature of the Self?

If case 2 is true, then how can the illusory Jiva, which has no
'reality' of it's own access it's source? OK, I understand that at the
Vyavaharika level this jiva is real. But is the Atman real at the
Vyavaharika level too? If so, why isn't it part of the composition of
the Jiva?

My final question would be, "How can the bridge be build between the
Illusory Vyavaharika Jiva and the Real Paramartika Atman?".

Probably by clearly defining the Vyavaharika and the Paramartika levels.
Probably Rama can give us a hand here! :-)
