With this we negate the reality of the empirical world. OK. But if this
empirical world is an illusion, then what am I who am part of this
empirical world? I'm an illusion too!

>So the universe is a result of the vikShepa shakti of avidyA.
By this am I correct in my understanding that the empirical world that I
experience is a result of my ignorance? But when I myself am an
illusion, what is my ignorance? Wouldn't that be an illusion too?

Again wouldn't that make jnana, sadhana and whatever effort that I might
take towards salvation which are part of my experience, illusions too?

So where's the Reality in all this?
