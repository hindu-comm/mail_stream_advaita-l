 Greetings. Presumably, there is some tradition somewhere which
 assigns  each khaNDa of the  ShrIvidyA mantra to a vidyA.
 Maybe, this is what the commentator (upaniShad brahma yogin) is
 referring to. I have heard of the ka-Adi vidyA, ha-Adi vidyA and
 sa-Adi vidyA being defined as you have. I felt the definition of
 upaniShad brahma yogin was interesting. That is why I noted it in
 my post.

 Anand
