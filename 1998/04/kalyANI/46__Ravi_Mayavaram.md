kalyANI

This is the second name in lalitA trishatI.

kalyANam means AnandA or bliss. A series of this, from yuva sArva
bhaumAnAnda to brahmAnAnda are enumerated in taittrIyopanishhad.
etasyai Anandasya anyAni bhUtAni  mAtra upajIvanti. Depending on a
speck of HER bliss all the creatures exist. Hence the word kalyANa
denotes all the created forms because SHE is present in all of them
who are HER various upAdhis or limitations (just as the sun, reflected
in the water in a pot is limited by the pot, so also Brahman, when HE
shines through created forms is limited by them, This form of
limitation is called upAdhi). When SHE is reflected in mAyA, SHE is
known as Ishwara, i.e., that is HER integral form, and when SHE is
reflected in the mind, is known as jIva, i.e, HER individual form.
Since SHE herself, exists in all these various limited states, of
unity or diversity, all these are HERs. kalyANI means in this context
that is SHE is nothing else except kalyANA, i.e., Ananda.
It is like calling rAhu's head. rAhu is a being without any body, but
only a head. Hence it will be superfluous in his case to say rAhu's
head, as if he has a body. Similarly SHE is kalyANA, i.e., bliss only
and nothing else.
