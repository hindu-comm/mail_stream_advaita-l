kalyANa gunashAliNi is the third name in shrI lalita trishatI.

SHE is resplendent with blissful attributes such as, satyakAmtva,
satyasankalpatva, sarvAdhipatva, sarveshAnatva, vAmanItva and so on.
 These are the attributes of brahman mentioned in chandyogyopanishhad.
They are splendid because of HER or they are attributes of HER
splendour. This name only suggests HER having certain arttributes as
kalyANa guNas. While vedas mention that all attributes results only
from limitation, yet it is not an error, if the stress in not laid on
that fact in this stotra. Recitation of HER attributes, necessarily
secures HER grace, when the devotee feels he is not separate from HER.
But still it is emphasized, that during worship the devotee must feel
his oneness with the deity, who is pure awareness (chaitanya). Since
it is better achieved through the initiation of guru, it is not
further elaborated here.
