        I am sorry if I gave you the impression that I thought
        you were confusing. No. It's just that considering the
        recent exchanges I thought it's best if it is stated
        out clearly at this juncture and future.

        I think you misunderstood me. If you read my mail again,
        I said it was the turn-around *point*, not the turn-around
        *cause*! I agree fully with you that it is God's grace, and
        God's grace alone that delivers.

        I am sorry if my mail sounded like criticism. You are doing
        a wonderful job of maintaining the list, and it is
        extremely unfair to question your judgement. I am sorry.
