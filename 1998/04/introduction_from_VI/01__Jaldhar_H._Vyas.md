Bravo.  One should not be satisfied with insipid translations written by
people who more likely than not do not have a clue when with just a little
effort one can have the real thing.  Just reading is not enough though.
Not just because until recently 99% of people in India were illiterate and
few of those who were literate knew Sanskrit (even though that's true) but
also because we have always placed a great emphasis on oral transmission
of our traditions.  Often a lot of the context is left unstated in the
written shastras.  So to get a true understanding one also has to observe
and listen to the living sages and scholars and to study history.

This is not the Vedantic view.  Despite the inadequacies of everyday
language, Brahman _is_ knowable and comprehendable.

Well what about all the devatas that don't have nomal human form?

No it is for love of God.  That's it.  Any other benefits are purely
incidental. As you are not a believer it may be hard for you to understand
but the relationship between a Bhakta and Bhagawan is more than that of a
person and his reflection in a mirror.  For instance in the Vaishnava sect
of the Vallabhacharis, the bhakta often sees themself as Yashoda the
mother of Krishna Bhagawan--a naughty boy who is always stealing ghee and
butter! How is that concept of God explained by your theory?

Your terminology is unusual but this is basically correct.  1. would
better be called sannyasi.  A philosopher is someone who thinks a lot.  A
philosopher is just someone who thinks a lot not neccessarily about
realizing the self.  A sannyasi is one who has given up all worldly
desires. Probably by thinking a lot but not neccessarily.

Dubious science aside, this is not the Vedantic view.  Brahman is _more_
than the sum total of perceivable things.

Actually the only thing that seperates us is ignorance.  Those virtues
etc. are also a product of ignorance.

Vedanta does not impute any desires such as curiosity to Brahman.  The
creation and destruction are only apparently real because of maya.

At least one view must also be true otherwise we have no means of knowing
the truth.  Vedanta is the attempt to find this truth.
