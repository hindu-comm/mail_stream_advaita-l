Ravi,

As you and readers of this list of this are probably aware, I am not shy
about rejecting what our sages have considered ignorant or worthless even
when as a result I have been accused of being intolerant, fanatic etc.
However even though I heartily concur with the feelings expressed in your
message, there is an aspect that trouble me.

To this day, even though I have learned to expect the posts of some
writers to be devoid of useful content, I haven't established a killfile
and try and read every single word.  Because you never know when some
nugget of wisdom might turn up.  Hope may be foolish sometimes but one is
better off for having it.

People usually have good intentions.  If they do things wrong it is out of
ignorance.  Luckily in the words of the shastras we have an excellent
means to fix this problem!  Armed with them without in anyway
compromising, we can refute all errors.  This may not be palatable to
every questioner but that shouldn't discourage anyone from trying.

So, in conclusion, I think you and Govind made the right choice in giving
this new poster a chance to be heard.  Now let's see what _he_ makes of
it.
