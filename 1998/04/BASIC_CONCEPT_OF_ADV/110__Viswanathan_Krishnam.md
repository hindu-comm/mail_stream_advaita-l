hi listmembers,

I have a basic doubt.

I am curious to know what is the basic concept preached by ADVAITA.

I would also like to know if there is any difference between the basic
concept of ADVAITA and the teachings of  ADI SHANKARA and why this list is
so specific in discussing only the teaching of ADI SHANKARA and not others
who advocated ADVAITA.

I know it is too basic and I apologise for this intrusion to the normal
flow of discussion.

Namaste:

 A small quote should be apt here.

The form is perceived and the eye is it's perceiver. The eye is perceived and
the mind is it's perceiver. The mind and it's modifications are perceived by
the witness, but it (the witness) is not perceived.

 The web pages maintained by Sri Vidyashankar Sundaresan are, in my
opinion, very good and you should be able to get your answers to the
questions you have asked there. The URL for these pages is:
http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~vidya/advaita/

Also, as I have noted before, the web pages of advaita-l has a very good
search engine. You may be interested in making use of that also.
The URL of the archives is:

A few questions (and the zest to find answers to them) now saves a lot of
ignorance later.

Cheers,
Vaidya.
