 I forgot to mention the source of these instructions of rAma.
 They are found in the kiShkindhA kANDa of the adhyAtma rAmAyaNa
 of the BrahmANDa purANa.

 Incidentally, this purANa is also the source of the lalitA
 trishatI that Ravi is posting, and the lalitA sahasranAma (the
 one thousand names of Goddess lalitA).

 Anand
