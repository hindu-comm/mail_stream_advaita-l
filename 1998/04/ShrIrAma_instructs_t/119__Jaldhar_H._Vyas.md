I had a question about this.  I have the Lalitasahasranama with the
Saubhagyabhaskara of Shri Bhaskararaya.  This also claims to be part of
the Brahmanda Purana and contains many of the names Ravi is posting
although in a different order.  Do I take it from your words above that
these are two different works not the same?  The Lalitasahasranama is
just over 300 shlokas.
