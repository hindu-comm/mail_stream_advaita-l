 This is an important question for advaitins. It has been discussed
 before on the list. Please see for example:

 Shankara has stated in the GItA bhAShya and elsewhere that karma
 done by renouncing the fruits (results thereof) or in dedication to
 God  has the effect of purification of the mind (chitta shuddhi).
 Thus such karma leads one to jnAna and may be said to indirectly
 cause liberation.

 For example, Shankara says in his commentary on the GItA:

 IshvarArpaNabuddhyA anuShThIyamAnaH sattvashuddhaye bhavati,
 phalAbhisandhivarjitaH |

 (karma) done as an offering to God (Ishvara) and without expectation
 of rewards,  purifies the mind.

 And (in his introduction to the Giitaa):

   shuddhasattvasya cha jnaananishhThaa-yogyataapraapti-dvaareNa
   jnaanotpattihetutvena cha niHshreyasahetutvamapi pratipadyate |

   The mind purified (by the performance of action without attachment)
   becomes eligible for the practice of knowledge, thus causing the
   rise of knowledge. This knowledge leads to liberation. So action
   (performed  without attachment to its fruits) (indirectly) causes
   liberation.

 For further elaboration on this, please see:
