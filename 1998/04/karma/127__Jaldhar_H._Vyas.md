Karma is of three kinds.  Nitya or that which is performed daily.
Naimittika or that which is performed at certain times or events or
places. And Kamya which is performed for a particular purpose.  The first
two can be performed dispassionately, the third by definition cannot.
Karma does specifically refer to ritual acts but in traditional thinking
rituals include mundane activities such as sneezing as well as "spiritual"
ones.

Although they agree on 80% of issues the big quarrel between Purva
Mimamsakas and Uttara Mimamsakas (or Vedantins) was over the scope of
karma.   The Purva Mimamsakas believe that it is valid till the day you
die and even a sannyasin is obligated to continue performing actions.
However a person desiring Moksha should refrain from kamya karmas and only
perform the nitya and naimittika ones out of a sense of obligation.
Shankaracharya teaches that even that isn't good enough and _all_ karma
should be given up.

Yes.

Karma has no role within Advaita Vedanta.  At best it can prepare and
purify a person for the Advaita path.  For the person who is not ready,
karma is completely mandatory. (But preferably of the nishkamya kind
mentioned above.)
