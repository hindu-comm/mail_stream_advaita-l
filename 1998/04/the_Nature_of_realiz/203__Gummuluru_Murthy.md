Namaste.

In addition to the many points made by Shri Sadananda, I like to add
the following.

Lack of second-guessing: while previously there is a doubt whether a
right decision is made ("I should have done the other way" feeling),
such feeling would no longer be there. The feeling "Everything is
unfolding the way it should" is the only feeling left. There is no
scope of second-guessing at all. Hence, the person will be
ever-content. Shri ShankarAchArya expresses this in a more
beautiful way in Viveka ChuDAmaNi (verse  543):

Nirdhano'pi sadA tushhTo'py  asahAyo mahAbalah
nityatr^pto'py abhunjAno'py asamah samadarshanah

Ever satisfied, though without riches; infinitely strong, though
without help; ever content, though not enjoying sense pleasures;
and without an equal, but seeing equality everywhere (such is a
person of Self-realization).

When all the desires that dwell in the heart fall away, then the mortal
becomes immortal, and attains Brahman even here.
