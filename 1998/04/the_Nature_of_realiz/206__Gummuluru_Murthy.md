Namaste.

Shri Shankara, who is a jnAni, says that a jnAni is a nitya-tr^pto (ever-
contented). If a jnAni is not a nitya-tr^pto, it means there are desires
in the heart and, as you very well know, that contradicts shruti (Katha u.
II.3.14; Br^hadAraNyaka IV.4.7). Thus, a jnAni, a jeevanmukta is a
nitya-tr^pto (ever contented) according to both the realized and the
unrealized.

Your concern may be my use of the word "unfold" in my previous post. Let
me clarify. There is nothing unfolding *for* the jnAni. The jnAni sees the
world and the changes associated with the world. However He knows the
world to be unreal and is only a witness to the things going on. That is
what I meant by my "unfolding". The only jeevanmukta we are aware of in
the modern day is Shri RamaNa. We cannot say Shri RamaNa did not see the
world. He saw the world and the changes in the world, but all as a
witness. He saw it for what it is, just unreal.

As an example, when He goes on a daily walk, He is aware of the changing
distance between the body and the Ashram, but He knows that He pervades
all and hence the unreality of the changing distance between the body and
the Ashram. You may be semantically correct in saying that there is
nothing unfolding for the jnAni, but my above few sentences, hopefully,
clarify, what I mean.

Gummuluru Murthy
