I request the list members to resume the normal discussion on the
list. Regarding the scope issue, I have posted the list policy. I
assure you I will be flexible and decide on case by case basis.

While discussing on the name kalidoShahara, shrI shankara points out,
"kali indicates quarrels between different schools of thought about
the Ultimate and the consequent sins these quarrels may engender. To
establish the respective positions, such as existence or non-existence
of God, HIS separateness from body, Whether he is a part or whole,
whether HE has attributes, people distort arguments,  and
consequently falsify conclusions by misinterpreting shrutis, and
mislead others. These lead to cupidity, anger and acrimony, under
whose influence, people abuse and hate one another. These acts are
sins of kali. SHE by conferring on devotees the realization of the
advaita-jnana leading to mokSha, destroys the sins of kali age."

AUM kalidoShaharAyai namaH. May shrI mAta, destroy the sins of kali
age and confer bliss to all of us.
