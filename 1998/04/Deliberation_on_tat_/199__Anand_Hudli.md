 One who is a mumukShu (desirous of liberation) should deliberate
 well on the meaning of the two terms tat (That) and tvaM (You) of
 the mahAvAkya (tattvamasi). The fire of knowledge that blazes from
 the (correct) ascertainment of (the meaning of) those two (terms)
 will burn up the bonds of saMsAra completely.

 After deliberating well on the meaning of the two terms, tat and
 tvaM, he,  who  himself destroys completely the Ego within himself
 with the understanding "I am Brahman", attains the Bliss of One-ness.

              (From the mahAvAkyadarpaNa)

 Anand
