 I will look forward to this most certainly.

 I have seen the aparoxAnubhUti and agree that it is a wonderful
 text. Let me add that to my (long) list of things I would like
 to discuss. If someone wants to start before I do, they are welcome.

See Chapter I of naishhkarmya siddhi. It's mainly devoted to discussion
of sannyAsa, what it means, and refutation of the pUrva mImA.nsA. shrI
sureshvarAchArya gives extremely original arguments, showing his mastery
over the subject of pUrva mImA.nsA.

Anand Hudli has written quite a few articles on this subject. He has
given pointers to those. Apart from that Giri, who is not on the list
right now, wrote a long, excellent article about it.

Please read the above very carefully. Also take a look at

There was huge discussion on this 2 years back. Just go to the archives
and search for posts with "householder" or "sanyasa" in their subject.
You will get more than what you bargained for :-).
