In principle, I accepts the points stated by shrI Vidyasankar Sundaresan.
As I wrote earlier, I will show flexibility on the scope of the List.
I will keeo in mind the items, discussed by the members on the scope of
the list.

But I request to the members, to remember when they write, purpose of the
list is to discuss advaita-vedanta as taught by shrI shankara.  Members
are free to write on topics related to advaita-vedanta as before. If
some article goes out of scope, I will decide on case by case basis.

Postings comparing buddhism, or other nAstika philosophies with
advaita-vedanta, with the purpose of clarifying few points and
with the intent of understanding advaita-vedanta will be accepted for
the list. But it has to go through me,  Other than this context, discussions
on traditions like buddhism and its philosophy will not accepted.

I thank for Shri Vidyasankar Sundaresan, taking his time and writing his
views on this issue. As always, his scholarly approach to the topic of
discussion is very helpful.
