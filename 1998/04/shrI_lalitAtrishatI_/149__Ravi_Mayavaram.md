namaskAram

I am summarizing the first twenty names for which I posted
shrI shrI shankara's bhAShyam. This summary is mainly to comtemplate
on the meaning of the names while chanting the mantra, which I think
not only increase the joy of chanting but also make it powerful. If
you find any flaws in the summary, please forgive me.

As a side note to what Ramakrishnan wrote, the panchadashAkSharI
mantra is also coded in the verse 32 of saundaryalaharI. If time
permits I will write about it later.

I think I have come full circle. Like most people, at least in the West,
I began by thinking of self realization as a dazzlingly discontinuous
event that would instantly change everything. Then slowly, mostly
through the teachings of Ramana Maharshi, I became comfortable with the
idea that we already are the Self here and now, and always have been,
and that all that is needed is to clear away our confused identification
of ourselves with the body/mind; but the I-am, the sense of self
awareness as we experience it every moment, already is the Self. So
instead of being like a stroke of lightning, realization might be more
like a gradual clearing of the mist that makes plain what is already
there. Then I began to think of Advaita as something that could be
explained to anyone in just a few simple words, calling upon everyone's
sense of contentless consciousness or self awareness as a strong
indication of its truth.

But the danger of this way of thinking, of putting Advaita in a sense on
almost the same level as any ordinary concept, is that equally ordinary
objections to it start to seem legitimate and relevant. In other words,
once it has been brought into everyday life, it no longer seems to
reside on an unapproachable mountain top, far above the issues of daily
living, and it becomes as assailable as any other idea. I'm afraid I may
not be expressing this very well, but I can't think of other words.

So at this point I am at a loss to find the proper balance between
discrimination and experience, and between working constructively toward
eventual realization and contending with nagging practical doubts. If it
is true that everything about human life can be understood (at least in
principle) without Advaita, then it becomes very difficult to keep going
and hold doubts at bay. If, on the other hand, there are aspects of the
human condition that don't make sense in their own terms, then I would
think that one legitimate role of discrimination would be to point them
out, even if only as an aid to the ongoing work toward the direct
experience of realization.

No!!! Descartes said "I think, therefore I am". In imprecise terms
advaita says "I am, therefore there is thought, this thought has
empirical reality only, but is actually an illusion". These two are
_far_ from being equivalent.

_Please_ read _classical_ advaita texts to get a proper idea of advaita.
There are lots of teachers out there who are supposed to be "advaitins".
This is only in a very loose sense. In any case, _this_ list is _only_
for discussing advaita as taught by shrI sha.nkara and his disciples. I
suggest in the order 1) Atma bodha of shrI sha.nkara, 2) dR^ik dR^ishhya
viveka of shrI vidyAraNya and then more intense texts like 3)
vivekachUDAmaNi of shrI sha.nkara. There is an excellent two volume
commentary on the daxiNAmUrti stotra by shrI Subbaramaiya, a disciple of
HH abhinava vidyAtIrtha, the previous head of the Sringeri Mutt. This
can be consulted after getting a background from the other 3 texts.
