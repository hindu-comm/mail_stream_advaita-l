     But is there really a division between the Self and its so-called
"reflection?"
Aren't you already what you are, seemingly, looking at?

     Well, where else would (or could) you be?  Nothing is ever separate
from the Self because the Self is all that there is.    Since there's no
"separate" realm or kingdom of Maya, it's impossible for anything to really
"exist" IN its realm.  At best, you can say that this Eternal and Absolute
"I" appears to manifest AS maya itself.
.
     In truth, though, it's an illusion that there's really an illusion
here at all.

     After all, exactly "who" (and where) is this separate one who is
experiencing this maya as illusory?   In other words, saying that there's
an illusion at all implies the objective existence of at least one separate
someone who is likely to be fooled by it.

     But, in non-dualism, isn't it all only the Self...pretending to not
pretend that it's not pretending?
