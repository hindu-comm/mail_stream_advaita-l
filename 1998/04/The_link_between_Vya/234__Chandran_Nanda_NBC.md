Greetings Chuck!

Thanks for the reply. Since I get to read the list daily in the form of
a digest, I read your post after I posted my second post on the subject.

It took me atleast 5 readings of your mail to understand what you said!

The fundamental difference between your mail and mine is that while you
talk from the Paramartika level, I write from the Vyavaharika. If
Non-Dual Brahman is all there is, it's very easy to argue from the
Paramartika end, dismissing all views from the Vyavaharika as Maya and
postulate the ONE being. But unfortunately I'm still at the Vyavaharika
level and viewed from this end the Eternal Absolute Atman seems
untenable and thus my questions.

If you want to answer my questions, you've to come down to the
Vyavaharika level and do so, as the Paramartika is beyond me.

        Because e-mail can be altered electronically,
        the integrity of this communication cannot be guaranteed.
