Hi Nanda,

     Because there are, quintessentially, no actual "levels" at all, there
is nothing that is (or could ever be) really "beyond" you.   In other
words, no matter what appears to be happening, the-you-that-IS is not at
"one level" trying to achieve "another level."

     When you are, seemingly, viewing the Eternal Absolute Atman from afar
(like from another "level") it will always remain, untenable (and, indeed,
"unattainable.")   Your very struggle to grasp the ungraspable is the
absolute guarantee that its subtlety will elude you.

     It takes effort to believe that you're not already what you
areseeking.   Stop making effort.

     To let go and be still is the pathless path to where you blissfully
reside.....even now.


                                                      With Blessings,

                                                                Chuck Hillig
