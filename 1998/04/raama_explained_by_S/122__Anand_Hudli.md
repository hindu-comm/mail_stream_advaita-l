 Here is a legend about Shankara Bhagavatpaada's commentary
 on the Vishnu sahasranaama. The Achaarya once asked a disciple
 of his in VaaraaNasii to randomly pull out a philosophical work
 from among many such works. When the disciple did so, it was
 the Vishnusahasra naama that was selected. For some mysterious
 reason, Shankara asked the disciple to put the sahasranaama
 back and try the experiment again. To everybody's surprise,
 the same sahasranaama was selected  for the second time, and
 again for the third time! Considering this incident to be a
 divine will, Shankara proceeded to write his commentary on it.
 The commentary is considered so authoritative that NiilakaNTha,
 the commentator on the Mahaabhaarata, has not commented on the
 Vishnu sahasra naama which occurs in the epic. NiilakaNTha has
 thereby shown his respect for Shankara's commentary.

 Let us look at what Shankara says about the name, "raama."

 The relevant text is:


 raamo viraamo virato
 maargo neyo nayo'nayaH |

 Shaankarabhaashhya:

    nityaanandalakshhaNe'smin yogino ramanta
  iti raamaH ;

 Raama, whose characteristic is eternal bliss, is one
 in  the contemplation of whom yogis delight.

  ramante yogino yasminnityaanande chidaatmani |
  iti raamapadenaitatparam brahmaabhidhiiyate ||

   The Para Brahman is called Raama to indicate the fact that
   yogis delight in the eternal bliss of Atman, which is pure
   consciousness (chit).

   iti padmapuraaNe ; thus says the Padma PuraaNa.

  svechchhayaa ramaNiiyam vapurvahanvaa daasharathii raamaH

  He assumed a handsome form, as the son of dasharatha, of
 His own accord. So He is called Raama.
