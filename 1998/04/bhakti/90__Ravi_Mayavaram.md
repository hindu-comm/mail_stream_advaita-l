bhakti is integral part of advaita vedanta tradition. I was surprised by
the mail by shrI Ram Chandran. shrI shankara himself wrote many many works
promoting bhakti. Even if the work is not by shrI shankara, or other
shankaracharyas, as long as they promote bhakti and are not offensive to
advaita vedantic tradition, they should be welcome.  As far as the scope
of the List, I have made it very clear.  There is so much freedom to
discuss useful things within the scope of the list itself. To press on the
issue that anything and everything should be discussed is unreasonable. It
is not a question of freedom of speech. We have a specific goal here, we
should try to focus on it.  I am sure shrI Ram Chandran would have read
the works published by kAnchi maTham, being from Tamil Nadu, both in Tamil
and English, especially works like Deyvaththin Kural (collected volume of
kAnchi periyavA's talks and writings, 5 volumes) promote bhakti so much. I
am very surprised, how shrI Ram Chandran, with so much learning and
experience, doubt about its relevance to the List.


I fully agree with shrI Anand on this issue.  I am  grateful to shrI
Anand for writing very very useful articles promoting bhakti here  on the
List and elsewhere. I request him to continue this great work. In
addition,  I request others also to contribute towards this effort.

Please do not worry about the scope issue. I will take care it through
private correspondence, if things get out of hand. If you are offended by
any posts, please write to me, I will try to resolve the issue. I think I
have made things clear through the List Policy post. If you still have
problems about the scope, please write to me, before writing to the list.

I sincerely aplogize for my poor management skills in the past. It is a
learning process for me. I will try to handle issues  about scope and
offensive posts through private correspondence. I will post the List
policy and also create a small FAQ about the list and post it  to the
list on regular basis.

I thank all the members who responded in private and on the list on the
scope issue.

with love and respects,
Ravi

Note: I dont like to write a mail to the list, with ADMIN as a subject
all the time. That is why I did not include that in this post.
