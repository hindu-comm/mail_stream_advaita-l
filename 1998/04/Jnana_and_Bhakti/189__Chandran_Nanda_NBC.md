On the subject of the three paths, bhakthi, karma and jnana, Charles
Wikner once said something which made a lot of sense to me. He said
something to the effect that :

Man is made up of three charecteristics : emotional, physical and
intellectual. Generally in a man, one of these is dominant over the
other two. So the appeal of one of the three paths is with respect to
one's charecteristics. Forcing a rational person along the lines of
bhakthi (faith and belief) will only serve to increase disillusionment
resulting in him dropping out of the pursuit altogether!

Again in Advaitam where the subject and the object are one, Sadananda's
explanation where he points out Shankara's definition that Bhakti is
meditating on one's Self makes sense. But it may be that it's easier to
meditate on an Ishta Devata (personal God) than on One's Self. That
means a personal God only serves the purpose of Upasana, rather than
anything literal. But along the road one must evolve towards meditating
on the Self, which alone can lead to liberation (atleast from the
standpoint of Advaitam).

I have attempted to follow this advice in the past, and have had
problems doing it. The reason is simple: A sense of a personal Deity
(Ishwara, Kali, whichever) that hears prayers and yet does not answer
them in any way I can recognize only provokes and intensifies my native
skepticism. I had the same problem with the Christian religion in my
early years. Most Christians can pray to God, get at least some vague
sense of release or comfort, and just go along with it their entire
lives. For some reason, I always expected something more tangible,
something that I could be sure that I was not providing to myself.

On the other hand, looking for one's own inner nature does not have this
characteristic, since our predicament of ignorance and confusion is
presumably self caused. Of course we can also say that our inability to
communicate with a Deity is also self caused, but the introduction of an
all-powerful 'other' agent into the situation makes this argument start
to sound like mere rationalization, like the traditional Christian
saying, "God answers all prayers, but sometimes the answer is No."

Sorry if my attitude seems presumptuous, but I'm just trying to be
totally honest.

I should probably just keep quiet, but I'm responding because I have
been facing exactly the same issue. All I've come up with is that the
'I' is what experiences everything else - thoughts, feelings,
perceptions, and so on - but is never perceived. In other words, the 'I'
is subject only, and everything else is object. So in meditation I try
to stay centered on the sense of 'I-am,' while registering as not-I
everything else that arises, just as you said. But 'I-am' is not
something that we perceive, as in an object... it's the thing that we
_are_. We know it by being it, not by perceiving it. That's as close as
I've come so far to understanding what is meant by Atma Vichara.

I'm sure that others will have much more insight, but I thought my
contribution might have a little value as one novice to another.
Sometimes beginners can speak the same language, but be puzzled by the
thoughts of experts.

I have read the Talks, and they influenced me greatly. But I found
Ramana to frustratingly vague in some respects, and that's how I got off
onto Nisargadatta. He seemed to phrase things in more plain language,
and in more different ways than Ramana did. It's also possible that
Ramana communicated a great deal to his visitors in silence, which of
course can't be included in a book.

I often have similar problems with Shankara. His technical formulations,
written in a style appropriate to another culture in the 8th century,
often leave me indifferent and puzzled. I could say the same (except
more so) about much of the Buddhist canon. I know this is strictly my
own limitation, but I don't think it's an unusual one. Ramakrishna,
Tagore, and others from the 19th century onward spoke in terms that seem
more immediate to the ears of many alive today.

The IshA upanishhat.h (verses 9-11) with shrI sha.nkara's commentary can
be referred to here. If one does not renounce, he has to both meditate
on the Gods and also do karma. For people who renounce worship of God is
not mandatory.
