If noone tries than none will ever know.  If we all try maybe we all will.
It's a hard road.  Some will run and some will stumble along but at least
they will be moving in the right direction.  All that needs to be done is
to make sure people don't try and take shortcuts that lead to dead ends.

Discussion has been strong but rarely erupted into unfriendliness.

But people who are sure they are doing things have doubts from time to
time.  That's basic human psychology.  To proceed further those doubts
need to be removed and that is rarely an instantaneous process.  One must
be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water.
