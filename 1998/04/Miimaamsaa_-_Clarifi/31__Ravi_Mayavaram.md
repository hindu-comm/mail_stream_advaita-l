namaskAram

pUrva mImAmsa does not require Ishvara as a giver of fruits of action,
Destiny by cause and effect chain governs it. But in advaita-vedanta
Ishwara is the one who does that. While commenting on the name karma
phala pradaa, shankara point out the need of a conscious agent
(Ishwara) to do that and destiny by itself cannot do that. This is my
understanding.

I hope other knowledgeable list members will give a more
rigorous analysis of this and correct me if I am wrong.
