Namashkar,
   I thank ShrI Chandran for his compliments and the interest the
members of this list have shown in responding to my queries.  I have
another request to make, in line with ShrI AnAnd's recent mail.

   I have read in the Advaita home page that ShrI Shankaracharya came
from a smArtha tradition.  I would like to know more about this
tradition.  From what I have read, the kind of worship that shrI AnAnd
had mentioned resembles smArtha tradition of worship.

   I specifically would like to know about what "smArtha" means with
respect to "shrAuta".

Thanks,

-Vivek.
