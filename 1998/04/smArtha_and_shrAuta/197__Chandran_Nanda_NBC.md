Brahmin subgrouping. Smarta means adhering to the Smriti. Historically
it's supposed to have been started by Shankara. Down South, the Iyers
are the Smartas. But I hear there's no such distinction up North where
all Brahmins are considered Smartas.

Encylopedia Britannia has some detailed information on this. Check it
out at www.eb.com. Take a test trial for a week, read all the info that
you want :-)
