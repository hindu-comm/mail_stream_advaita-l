156. kalAlApA

SHE for whom the shAstra-s are like common speech.

kalA indicates the 64 kalA-s or arts. AlApa means common speech.
To HER, the shAstra-s are like common speech.  According to
vedashAstramayI vANii yasyAH sA paradevata, what paradevata
speaks is veda-s and shAstra-s.

Another interpretation of this name is, kala means purposeful and
indescribably sweet. And AlApa means conversation.  According to
"avyaktabhAratI tatha" The speech of great ones is like that. HER
speech is very sweet and purposeful.

>From  a translation of
shrI shankara bhAshyam of shrI lalita trishatI

-----------

This reminds me of one of the verses in saundaryalaharI. Once
vANii was playing vINa and singing the liilaa-s of pashupati in
HER assembly and impressed by the beauty of the music, ambAL said
sabAsh!. Immediately, vANii covered the vINa and kept quiet, as
the sweetness of ambAL's voice put the sweet music of vINa to
shame.
