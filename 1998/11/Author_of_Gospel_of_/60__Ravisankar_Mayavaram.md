namaste

shrI mahendranAth gupta's pen name is M. He is called as Master
mahAshAya in Autobiography of a Yogi. You are confusing him with
shrI Lahari mahAshAya. Refer to the chapter 9 I pointed out
earlier. mahAshAya is a title in Bengali like Sir. M is called
Master mahAshAya because he was a school teacher.

MahendranAth gupta alias M is the Author of Gospel of shrI
Ramakrishna paramahansa.

namaste

I agree with shrI Anand.

In addition, if someone can discuss the shankara bhAShyam on shrI
viShNu sahasranAmam it will be very nice. I know that in bhakti
list as comparative posting of shankara bhaShyam (briefly) with
that of parAshara bhattar is being done.  May be if someone can
discuss the shankara bhAShyam in detail here, we all can learn.
Even one or two names a week will be suffice.

With regards,
Ravi
