155. kAntidhUtajapAvalii

HER brilliance puts the japA flowers to shame. Here, japA flower
(Hibiscus)  is indicative of all flowers that are red in color.
Traditionally, poets compare HER radiance with the japA flower.
But it is incorrect. According to "na mahA.nto
nIchaiyupamIya.nte", great ones can not be compared with inferior
things. HER brilliannt radiance which is illuminating, blissful,
transcendental awareness, can not be compared with worldy masses
of japA flowers of poor brilliance. Hence, it is said that HER
form puts the japA flowers to shame. Here, the impropriety of the
comparison is suggested.
