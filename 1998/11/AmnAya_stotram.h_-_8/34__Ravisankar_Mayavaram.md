Further details about the govardhana maTha at Puri.

bhogavAlas sampradAyas satrAranyavane pade |
tasmin devo jagannAthaH puruShottama saMj~nitaH || 8 ||

The sampradAya followed by the maTha is bhogavAla and the
dashanAmi orders that were assigned are AraNya and vana. The Lord
(deva) of the maTha is jaggannAtha ( shrI mAhaviShNu) who is
known as puruShottama (the best puruSha). shrIman nArayaNa is
called puruSha as the He is primordial source of the whole
creation as described in puruSha sUkta. The name jagannAtha
literally means Lord (nAtha) of the Universe (jagat).

If Knowledgeable members can throw light on the saMpradAya-s
followed by the maTha-s, it will be nice.

Thanks.

Ravi
