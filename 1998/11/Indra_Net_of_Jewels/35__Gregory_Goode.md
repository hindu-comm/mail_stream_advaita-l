Already posted to the advaitin list, so please forgive this if you're
receiving it twice:

Can the learned members of this list suggest a lead for me?

A friend asked about a reference she saw to Indra's net of jewels.  Each
jewel in the net reflects all the others.  The reference was used as a
scriptural support for the new-science holographic model of the universe.
Can anyone think of a passage this might have come from?  Thanks very much.

Hari Om!

I believe this is something used in Buddhist literature. I may be
mistaken, on this, but I remember reading this in some Buddhist text. If
I remember I'll let you know. AFAIK, it's not a vedantic term.
