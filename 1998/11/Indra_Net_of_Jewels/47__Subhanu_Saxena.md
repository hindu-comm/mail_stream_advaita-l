        I completely agree-my points 2 and 3 in my email were more about how
the concepts of interconnectness are not unknown in Vedanta, though with a
different standpoint as to what is the substratum.  With regards to my
point 3, I would be interested to hear if anyone has done a systematic
research of Shankara's bhashyas and done a comparative study with current
scientific thinking.  Everything I have come across so far seems to be
lacking rigour, or sounds a little too "New Age".

Again, agreed-I hope I gave Greg what he needed.
