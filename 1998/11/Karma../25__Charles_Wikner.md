I have another translation: The Bhagavad Gita with the Commentary
of Sri Sankaracarya, tr. by Alladi Mahadeva Sastry, Samata Books.
It does not have the originaly bhashya text, only the translation.

His translation of the three fragments in question are:
(1) "all castes and religious orders (varna-Asrama) -- from the
     brAhmaNAs downwards, -- "
(2) "spiritual life (Brahmanatva)"
(3) "He who knows the truth does not think 'I act,' nor does he
     long for the results.

Regards, Charles.
