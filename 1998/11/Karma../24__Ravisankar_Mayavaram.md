I bought the book by Warrier from Vedanta Catalog
http://www.vedanta.com/

They sell one other translation of shankara bhAShya of bhagavad
gItA by svAmi gambhIrAnanda.
http://www.vedanta.com/12.html

Since Krishna Warrier, gives the original saMskR^itam.h text
along with the translation.  I try to read the saMskR^itam.h text
few times along with the translation. Also Warrier has split the
comlex sandhi-s and made the reading of the text relatively
simple.
