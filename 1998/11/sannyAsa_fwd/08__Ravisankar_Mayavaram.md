If the members of the list can take their time to address this
question, I will pass it on to the original author of the

Subject: sanyAsa


I would like to have a proper translation of the Sanskrit term
'sanyAsa' (as in 'karma-sanyAsa-yogah' in the text of gitA).

I would appreciate any help in this regard.
