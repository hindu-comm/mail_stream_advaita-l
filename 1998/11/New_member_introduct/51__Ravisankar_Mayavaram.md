Namaste
   My name is Dattatri Radhakrishna. I am from Bangalore & am
currently working for a Telecommunications company in New Jersey,
USA. I am a Smartha Brahmin by birth & so was inculcated into the
traits of Advaita from the begining by my devout parents. As days
went by I learnt more & more about the life & times of Adi
Sankaracharya. It just so happened that my sister got married to
a Madhwa Brahmin & it was with my Brother-in-law that I started
discussing about the inherant qualities in Advaita & Dwaita
philiosophies. These discussions helped me go deeper into the
aspects of life which I hadn't bothered to look upto earlier on.

   I was surfing the net for some good sites on Adi Sankaracharya
& came across this. I would be glad to contribute whatever I know
to the community.

Thanks & warm regards
      Dattu
