Hello..

I am Radha, a telecom engineer by profession and a Hindu by faith. My
family considers Jagadguru AdiShankaracharya as Guru, and I have grown
up listening to recitations of stothrams authored by the Guru. I would
like to know more about Advaita philosophy and participate in the
discussions.

Radha
