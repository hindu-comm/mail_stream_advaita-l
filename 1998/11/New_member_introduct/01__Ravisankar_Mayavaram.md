Subject: Brief Introduction

I  come from Mylapore, Madras and was a student of Vivekananda Collge. I
have a working knowledge of Sanskrit, having learned the language at
Sanskrit College in Mylapore. My exposure to Advaita statred with Bhaja
Govindam as explained by Rajaji in Kalki.  I have pursued  these
interests over years.  Currently I am a Professor of Business
Administration at Morgan State University, Baltimore.  I am a founding
trustee of murugan Temple of North America at Washington D.C.  I look
forward to participating in the list.
