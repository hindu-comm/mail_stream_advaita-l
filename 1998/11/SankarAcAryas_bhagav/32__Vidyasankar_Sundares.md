This is one grey area in varNASrama dharma. paraSurAma and agniveSya were
brAhmaNas, but they taught archery and war strategy to kshatriyas. droNa
and drupada were students of agniveSya, bhIshma studied with paraSurAma.
As far as teaching the pANDava and kaurava princes is concerned, it would
seem that droNa's conduct was okay, because teaching is the province of
the brAhmaNa. Krishna was probably referring to this past conduct of
droNa. His having personally taken part in the war would be the more
problematic issue, but in the setting of the gItA, the war has not yet
begun.
