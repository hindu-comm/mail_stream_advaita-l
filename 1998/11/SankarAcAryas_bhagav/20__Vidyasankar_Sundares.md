It seems likely. I haven't read the bhAshya on chapter 5 in too much
detail yet. Re: the quotation marks on 'aham karomi' I'm unsure what to
make of them. Such marks are not usually found in Sanskrit texts, and my
feeling is that mss read *nAham karomIti*, and not *na 'aham karomi' iti*.
On the other hand, Warrier could not have himself introduced those
quotation marks and also translated the way he does, so that it is
mysterious where these marks come from. I am still in two minds about the
translation I posted. Perhaps, a dual sense was intended by the
bhAshyakAra, and purposefully so.

Thank you. I would appreciate it very much if those of you who have the
Skt text of the bhAshya go through the translation with the original text,
and point out errors/inaccuracies/ambiguities.

Vidyasankar
