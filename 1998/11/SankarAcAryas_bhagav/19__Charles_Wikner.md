That is indeed a significant point, and worth highlighting as you have
done.  Interestingly, the text that I have with Warrier's translation
(Sri Ramakrishna Math) adds quotation marks in the nagarI which accords
with your translation: ... na 'aham karami' iti ...

Perhaps Warrier was associating this with a similar statement in Gita
5.8 (naiva kiMcit karomIti yukto manyeta tattvavit | ) where the verb
is manyeta (vidhi-li"n) and not manyate (laT) as here.

I am thoroughly enjoying this series of posts, and find the pace very
useful, for it allows time amid the worldly rush for each point to sink
in deeply.  It is like the slow measured tread of a walking meditation.

Thank you very much for sharing the fruit of your labours: it is much
appreciated and put to good use.

Kind regards, Charles.
