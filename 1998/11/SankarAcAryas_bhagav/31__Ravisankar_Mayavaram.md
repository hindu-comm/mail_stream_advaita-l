namaste

How is shrI dronAcharya's conduct virtuous? He forsake his
svadharma (brahmana) and took paradharma (kShatriya). In the
verse 2.11, the forsaking one's dharma is
taking paradharma is condemned. Flaws such as, grief and delusion
are stated as reason for such things. Even in the introduction,
it is said that the primordial nArAyaNa  takes birth to establish
the dharma and remove the confusion in the varNAshrama dharma.

Any clarifications welcome.

With respects,
Ravi
