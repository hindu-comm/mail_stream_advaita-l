In the 10th shloka of the daxiNAmUrti stotra, we have sarvAtmatva
occuring twice, but not sarvAtmabhAva. However mAnasollAsa by
SureshvarAcArya contains the word sarvAtmabhAva, 10.19.

sarvAtmabhAva-sAmrAjya nirantarita-chetasAm.
paripakkasamAdhInAm ki.nki.n nAma na sidhyati.

According to my index to the BSB, sarvAtmabhAva occurs in his
brahmasUtrabhAshhya to sUtra 2.3.13. When I get the time, I'll dig up
the original verse.

Rama
