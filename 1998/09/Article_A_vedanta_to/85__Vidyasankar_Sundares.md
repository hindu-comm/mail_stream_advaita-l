Has the source of this quote been identified? In another work,
SankarAcArya uses the word sampradAyavit to refer to his paramaguru,
gauDapAda. However, I can't recollect that the adhyAropApavAdAbhyAm
nishprapancham prapanchyate half verse occurs in the gauDapAda kArikAs. If
the source of this quote is identified, it may provide another small clue
to vedAnta in pre-Sankaran times.
