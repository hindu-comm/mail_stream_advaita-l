Dear Guy:

                I have read some of Lilian's translations also. She did have the famous
Lakshmanjoo who was considered an expert in Kashmir Shaivism as her
teacher. I just wanted to mention to you that he had forbidden her to
translate some works, especially found in her book on Kundalini. But she
felt otherwise. For a more detailed viewpoint of this, look at the books
written by the father of lakshmanjoo's successor  (john hughes, I think).
The reason I wanted to mention this is not to degrade Lilian in any way,
but to point out that all her translations did not have the approval of her
guru.

namaste.
