About this stilling of thoughts:  I have a question which I will  pose in
a seperate post.

Yoga and Vedanta have gotten thoroughly mixed during the centuries but
there are philosophical differences.  In the Brahmasutrabhashya
Shankaracharya criticizes Sankhya-Yoga theories in many places.  Because
he is so strongly against the idea of karma playing any part in moksha,
and he considers meditation a type of karma.

It is precisely for this reason, I don't think the vivarana attributed to
Shankaracharya is genuine.  But of course I have no way to prove that.

I didn't say it is worthless.  Some people make wild and exaggerated
claims for meditation but like Bhakti, Upasana if done with the
proper attitude purifies and prepares one for Jnana.  I don't think it is
vital from the Vedantic point of view though.  The example of Gayatri japa
is a good one.  It gives just as much benefit as yogic practices because
it is also meditation.  I think Nanda was referring to the latter kind of
meditation not japa though.
