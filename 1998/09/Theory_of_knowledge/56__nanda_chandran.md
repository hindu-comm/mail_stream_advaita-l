Yes, there's just a disagreement in the words being used. But again
aren't words the verbal expression of ideas?

I'm not denying the continum which still persists while we're in deep
sleep. Obviously there is. What I'm unable to understand is how this
continum can be termed consciousness, for all consciousness imply a
subject and an object.

Infact, has any of you ever fainted? One moment you're awake and then
the next there's absolutely no consciousness at all, till you regain
consciousness. Ofcourse you remember the moment you lost consciousness
but nothing between that and the moment of regaining consciousness. And
definitely one can't equate the state of being faint with consciousness.
So why can't this be the same as the state of deep sleep?
