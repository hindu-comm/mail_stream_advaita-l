No this is just memory.  And memeory can sometimes play tricks on the way
things are perceived.  It is the organ (for want of a better word)  that
is responsible for the fact that anything is perceived at all which is the
soul.

Thoughts are "generated" in the way waves in the ocean are.  A wave is just
a peturbation in the water which distorts it in a particular way.  it
arises, persists for a while and then disappears.  But in all that time it
was never really different from the rest of the water.

It's not so much that you control them but by understanding their true
nature you can ignore them.

If you add that proviso you may be right but who said the pure
consciousness is the same as every day consciousness?  Consciousness is
felt and the feeling persists between periods of wakefulness.  therfore
there must have been consciousness in between.  And there must be an
entity to be conscious.

If people are falling asleep while meditating then dare I suggest they're
doing it wrong?  I don't do any meditation myself (neither do I think it
is a vital part of sadhana.  The benefits toted for it could also be
achieved through drugs.)  but there are times like during an intense bout
of programming when I've felt a sort of hyper-awareness.  It's hard to
describe it.  That I suppose is what the results of meditating should be.

But to not be conscious during deep sleep means you're dead :-)

I can't see how existence can be described as a state of unconsciouness
either.
