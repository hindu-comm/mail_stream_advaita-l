Now, according to you the mind is _not_activated before the contact with an
object activates it. But what sustains the mind in its inactive state ? How
do you know that the mind is not active before the contact ?

According to you, consciousness is 'absent' during deep sleep. A
subject-object relationship is absent. But consciousness is not. There seems
to be a clash of terminologies here rather than that of ideas. What is it
that stays during all the three states of waking, dreaming and deep sleep ?
How do you know that you were in deep sleep ? Is not a continuum felt ?
Don't you feel like you have existed for the past 10 years ? The underlying
substratum is termed 'consciousness' here and not what you lose when you
become unconscious.

Please quote a reference in this regard.

What is that state ? As said earlier, it is a clash of terminologies rather
than that of ideas.

Namaste,
Raghavendra.
