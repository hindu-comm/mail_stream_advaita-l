There different techniques of meditation. Most of them aim at
making the mind one-pointed and still the thoughts. When one
succeeds in going to deep states of meditation, intense bliss of
deep sleep will be felt. Unlike deep sleep one will be aware of
it.  If one sleeps during meditation, then he is not really
meditating. He has failed in meditating correctly.  If one feels
sleepy, it is better to sleep well and then start the meditation.


Meditation has great value. It importance in stressed in
patanjali's yoga sUtra, there is a vivaraNa on vyAsa bhAShya
attributed to shrI shankara. Even doing gAyatri japam is a form
on meditation. I do not know how you concluded on worthlessness
of meditation.

This is my last post on this topic.
