Raju writes;
I have fainted twice , in my early age of 20 & another time at  age 36, I
think. Both the time , when I went to the Bath room , I got fainted. What I
recall is a dreamlike state, but more like a void a big void with discomfort.
I think there is consciousness to experience of what is happening.
I just thought I should submit my experience, since you were asking have you
experience the state of being fainted ?
I hope it is not too inappropriate to mention my experience here. Pl. correct
me if I am wrong.
Namaste.
Raju
