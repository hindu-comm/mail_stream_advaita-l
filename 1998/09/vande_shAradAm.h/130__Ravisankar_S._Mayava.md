<verses on sarasvatI deleted>

Both the verses you have quote are part of the sarasvatI stotram
and it is available in the Jaguar site. This stotram starts with
yA kundendu and ends with the shloka "sarasvatyai namo nityam
bhadrakAlyai namo namaH ... "

The aShTottaram I have on shrI sarasvatI calls HER shivAnujA. Can
some on throw more light on this aspect, highlighting HER as the
sister of shiva (whose guru aspect was well explained by Rama's
post).

Ravi
AUM bhAratyai namaH
