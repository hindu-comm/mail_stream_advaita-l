 I bow to that Highest IshvarI, Goddess ShAradA (Sarasvatii),
 who is white complexioned, who is the supreme essence of the
 inquiry into Brahman, who is the origin of the world and pervades
 it everywhere, who holds the  (musical instrument) Veena (lute) and
 book (in two of Her hands), who (displays the abhayamudra) with
 another hand (indicating that She bestows safety by driving away
 fear), who in ( Her fourth) hand holds a garland made of crsytals,
 who is seated in a lotus, who drives away the darkness of dullness of
 intellect, and who bestows intelligence.

 Another popular verse on sarasvatI:

 yA kundendutushhAra-hAradhavalA yA shubhravastrAvR^itA
 yA vINAvaradaNDamaNDitakarA yA shvetapadmAsanA       |
 yA brahmAchyutashaMkaraprabhR^itibhirdevaiH sadA pUjitA
 sA mAM pAtu sarasvatI bhagavatI niHsheShajADyApahA  ||

 May She, Goddess sarasvatI protect me (from dullness of intellect),
 who is as white as the white jasmine, moon, snow, and garland, who is
 dressed in white clothes, whose hand is adorned by the excellent vINA
 (lute), who is seated in a white lotus, who is always worshipped by
 the gods beginning with BrahmA, ViShNu, and Shiva, and who drives
 away all dullness of intellect.
