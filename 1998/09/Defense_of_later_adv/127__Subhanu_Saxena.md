        I don't think you sound churlish at all, and thank you for your
learned considered reply.  As a fan of "A no bhadrAha kratavo yantu
vishwataha" I am delighted that someone has taken up for consideration
the different (and more "traditional") view. My responses to Anand Hudli
and Swami Atmananda's emails cover my observations on this one, and I
will not add anything further at this point.  My article on adhyAsa
bhAshyam will give people more food for thought.  I wish everyone out
there success in finding a meaning that is in tune with their inner
intuition from their studies.

        Subhanu
