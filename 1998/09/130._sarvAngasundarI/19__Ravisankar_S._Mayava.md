130. sarvA"ngasundarI

All HER a"nga-s are very beautiful. sarvA"nga denotes all limbs
like head, hand, etc. They are beautiful and in right proportion
as described in the sAmudrika shAstra.

Or just as a beautiful thing is loved and cherished by all, SHE
as brahman is  cherished and most desired by all.
