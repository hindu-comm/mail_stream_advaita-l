Yes, paths can diverge, and I've heard that Aurobindo's does diverge from
Ramana's and formal advaita's (but can't quote any details on that).  My
point about there not being two moons is that we all know that there really
is just one moon.  So in Reality (the Moon itself) there can't be any other
destinations, no matter what the philosophies say.  Might take a sadhaka
longer than the direct path, but there can't be anywhere else to go, sort
of like the quotes below say.

Rama, thank you very much for these comments, they actually warm my heart
and make me happy!  A friend of mine who was at Sringeri has the highest,
utmost respect for the Sringeri teachers.  I would like a few exact quotes
if you don't mind.
