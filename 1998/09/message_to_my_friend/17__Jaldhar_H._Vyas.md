Madhavacharya who wrote the commentary on Suta Samhita also wrote
Sarvadarshanasangrah which gives a summary of all schools of thought
including nastika ones.  They are organized in ascending order from
Lokayata (materialist) all the way up to Advaita Vedanta the final and
ultimate.  Note if this isn't saying religions are "good" or "bad" it is
saying they are better or worse!

Ramachandran did kind of.  What he was saying is that it was bad
_for_him_ and _he_ didn't do it.  IMO that is the right attitude to take.
At the beginner level people are full of doubts.  They shouldn't make bold
pronouncements such as this is good or bad because they don't know.  But
once a person has begun following a path in earnsest they need to stick to
it and not keep looking over their shoulders at what other people are
doing.  Moral life involves making judgements.  This is unavoidable.  But
to avoid harm we should do our best to make informed judgements.  It is
the failure of the "all religions are the same" people to do this which is
my chief criticism not the idea that there is good in other religions.
