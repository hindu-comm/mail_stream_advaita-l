This sentence is found in the bhagavad gItA bhAshya 13. 13. as Subhanu
quoted, a few days ago. The paingala upanishad, which if I remember right,
has been quoted in SankarAcArya's brahmasUtra bhAshya, also mentions
adhyAropa - apavAda. However, I do not remember whether it has it in the
form of the sentence, adhyAropa-apavAdAbhyAM nishprapancam prapancyate. If
someone has access to Radhakrishnan's "The Principal Upanishads" please do
check if the paingala upanishad has the same sentence. I would be very
grateful for the information.

Thanks,
Vidyasankar
