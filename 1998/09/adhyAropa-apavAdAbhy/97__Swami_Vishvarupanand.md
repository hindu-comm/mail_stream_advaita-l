Harih Om,

I did not find the above sentence (which may be due to oversight also), I
found the following:

adhyaaropaapavaadataH svaruupaM nishcayiikartuM shakyate. tasmaat sadaa
vicaarayejjagat-jiiva-paramaatmaano jiiva-bhaava-jagad-bhaava-baadhe pratyag
abhinnam brahmaivaavashiSyata iti. (Pai.Up. 2.12)

Radhakrishnan's translation:
<<It is possible to determine the nature of the Self through the way of
super-imposition (of qualiaties that do not belong to it) and denial.
Therefore one should always inquire into the nature of the world, the
individual and the supreme Self. With the denial of the (ultimate) reality
of the soul and the world, the innermost Self non-differentiated from
Brahman alone remains.>>

Greetings and Om,
Vishvarupananda
