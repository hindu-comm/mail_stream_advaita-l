namaste !
I have not found exactly your quotation, but the 12th and last mantra
of the Paingalopanishad in Radhakrishnan's "The Principal Upanishads"
runs as follows :

 tadA sad-gurum ASritya cira-kAla-sevayA bandham moksham kaScit
prayAti.avicArakRto bandho vicArAn moksho bhavati ; tasmAt sadA
vicArayet. adhyAropApavAdataha svArUpam niScayIkartum Sakyate. tasmAt
sadA vicArayej-jagaj-jIva-paramAtmano jIva-bhAva-jagad-bhAva-bAdhe
pratyag abhinnam brahmaivAvaSishyata iti.
Pai. U. II.12

And Radhakrishnan comments : The way of superposition and denial is
developed by Shankara in his Introduction to S.B.

Hope this can be of help you and that I made no error in the
transliteration. If you have any doubt, don't hesitate to ask me to
check once more.

Regards

Guy
