Namaste.

I do not think it is a dvaita view. I take Shri Shankara's stotras on Gods
as showing that nothing happens in this illusory jagat without God's will.
The stotras on Gods and Godesses is to show the limitation of the human,
to cut down the aham and show that human cannot think that he/she is
responsible for doing things. That is not to say that Shri Shankara wrote
the stotras with that in mind. I take the stotras as the outcome of the
feeling in the heart which a human would feel when the ego has melted.
The difference between a human and God is we see the human while the
God is invisible. The human and the God are both in the same plane of
our understanding.

I cannot answer for others but for myself. Firstly, I do not grade myself
to be knowledgeable. The reason I have curtailed my posting is: I do not
know what response would be there for my posts. I find, while the List is
excellently run, there are too many personal attacks, which are
unnecessary.
