                                              Om

Being a Master and propunder of Advaita why Adi Shankara composed several
stuti's, stotras etc. to multitude of Gods and Godesses  advancing Dwaita
view?

I asked this question to my good friend sada who left this forum (I think
'cause of  ego) and I am not satisfied with his response.

May be Jaldhar, Vaidya, Ravi, Saxena and others offer an explanation to clear
my doubt.

For my friend Sada and others:
I feel,   being knowledgeble is great  but unless one puts in practice  it is
worth nothing.
