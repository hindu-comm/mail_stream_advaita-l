God is not invisible.  She is sakara
I have seen Devi as a little girl in Kamakhya, as a older woman in Varanasi
and as a maiden in Madanapalli.        See my introduction several years ago
in archives.

Agreed.   But running away is not an option.

Now I would like ask another question.  Like you said stotras etc. is fine
whether they represent dwaita view or not.   You must have read Saundyalahari.
Adi Shankaras masterpiece. My favorite.  Parayana once with nistchala bhakti
and homam will achieve anything material or spiritual.  I am saying this by
experience.

Now the question is Why Shankara being a Sanyasi describes mother in such a
romantic way in Saudalyalahari.   In this world I have seen no son describing
his mother in such a romantic way.   I am searching for an answer, so far I
did not able to get a convincing response.

I asked sada. His response was good.  He said Shankara is a great poet.  What
he saw he described and not with any other thoughts.  So did Kalidasa.
I guess this answers God is invisible too.
