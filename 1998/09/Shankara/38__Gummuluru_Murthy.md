Namaste.

I do not see Soundarya LaharI as an erotic or a romantic description.
It is again an outpouring from the heart of what Shri Shankara "sees"
in front of Him. The description is not any different from some Shri
LalitA trishati names, or some in ShyAmalA dandakam. Also in SivAnanda
LaharI, we come across some very imaginative descriptions.

It may be a taboo to describe human anatomy for a mind contaminated by
the social restrictions of the mAyA-generated jagat and such mind may
see it as a romantic or an erotic description. But for the free and
pure spirit of Shri Shankara, that is not a restriction. He described
what He visualized in front of Him. And we also need to see it in
that way.
