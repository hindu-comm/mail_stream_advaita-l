The references pick up the idea of sR^ShTi, sthiti and laya:

yato vA ... (Tait. 3.1.1 "That from which all these beings take birth,
             That by which they live after being born, That towards which
             they move and into which they merge ... That is brahman.")

janmAdyasya ... (BS. 1.1.2 "That [brahman] from which (yataH) [are derived]
             birth etc. (janma-Adi) of this (asya) [universe].")

Regards, Charles.
