??? vadya (dhAtu vad) is a viSeshaNa meaning "to be spoken".

a-vadya means "not to be spoken" (i.e. unspeakably shocking).
PANini 3.1.1 gives the sense of avadya as garhya (contemptible, vile).

an-avadya thus has the sense of not-vile, irreproachable, without
blemish, faultless, blameless -- in other words, perfect, in the
sense of pUrNamadaH pUrNamidaM ... (That is perfect, this is perfect).

TaittirIya Upanishad 1.11.2 gives:

      yAnyanavadyAni karmANi | tAni sevitavyAni | no itarANi |
          ^^^^^^^^
      Whatever deeds are irreproachable - those are to be practiced -
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      and not others.

You could also pick up a sense of "totally beyond speech" (nirguNa)
or "worthy of praise" (saguNa).
