Another interesting side note about thirujnAnasambhandar he is an
avatara of Lord shaNmukha. And when he was a little child,
pArvatI along with parameshvara came and fed him jnAna in the
form of milk.  This is a reason for he being called a jnAnana
sambhandar

It is well known that Lord shaNmukha was from the fire that
emanated from the third eye of Lord shiva. thirujnAnasambhandar
left the world entering the fire, which is such a natural thing
to him. In fact, shrI kumarila bhaTTa who is also an avatara of
Lord shaNmukha entered the fire and left the world. But there
reasons given for entering the fire was different though. This is
another interesting connection betweern these two. I learnt this
from the talks of shrI chandrasekharendra sarasvati.
