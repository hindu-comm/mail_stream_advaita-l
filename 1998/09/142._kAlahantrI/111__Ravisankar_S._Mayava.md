adhyAtmayogAdhigamena devam matva dhIro harShashokam jahAti
[kaThopaniShad 2-12] which means, "The hero having turned away
from the sense objects, thinks himself as divine having discarded
joy and sorrow.  And according to the shruti "tathaH saMvatsaro
ajAyata" which means, "from Him the time (year) was born". In
this shruti birth of time brahman is mentioned. When the time
merges back into HER it ceases to exist. Hence, SHE is called the
killer of time.
