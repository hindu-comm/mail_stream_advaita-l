 =============================================================================

Hello from a young man living in Romania who wants to have friends for spiritual
discussions. My name is George Macavei, I am 27 years old, married and I live
in Bucharest.

The thing I enjoy the most is practicing "Atma Vichara" (Self Inquiry) for a few
hours a day. I also read and study books with Ramana's teachings. For me,
Ramana's teachings are the deepest of all Indian philosophies. I also like
Advaita Vedanta, Tao and Zen teachings.

I was in India between September 28, 1997 and January 22,1998 and I visited Sri
Ramanashramam in Tiruvannamalai and other spiritual places.

I will reply to all who share similar interests and who have an ardent desire to
realize the Truth.
