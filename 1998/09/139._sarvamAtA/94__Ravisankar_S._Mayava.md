139. sarvamAtA

SHE is inferred by the resultant act, i.e, jagat, because SHE is
its cause and not different from it. This jagat which is within
HER manifests only her reality by being one with HER. Just as a
blanket can be apprehended only as a something resulting from
yarn and identical with it.(*)

AUM sarvamAtre namaH

(*) Here, by the panchAvaya vAkya, the proposition that jagat is
not different from brahman is established. The five steps are
1) pratij~nA [Enunciation]
2) hetu [Reasons]
3) udAharaNa [Illustration]
4) upanaya [Inference] &
5) nigamana [Conclusion]
