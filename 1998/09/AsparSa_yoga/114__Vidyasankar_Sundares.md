re: Raphael, I forgot to mention that I've read a translation of
dRg-dRSya-viveka of bhAratI tIrtha svAmin (14th c.), which was quite good.
The original text in Sanskrit verses was provided along with the English
translation. Certainly worth giving a serious reading.

Re: avidyA in deep sleep, I should have mentioned the kArikA bhAshhya,
kArikA 3.34.

In that to the pUrvapaxa argument that the mind in deep sleep and the
controlled mind are the same Sh replies:

atrochyate | naivaM |yasmAtsushhupte.anyaH prachAro.avidyAmohamogras
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
tasyAntarlInAnekAnaryapravR^ittibIjavAsanAvato ...

I have given only the most important sentence. To get a full
understanding, the previous verses and also the bhAshhya of those need
to be read. That should prove that Sh does say that avidyA does exist in
deep sleep.
