The subject isn't always a whom, it can be an impersonal what, since any
feature or quality that makes a "whom" out of something impersonal and
featureless is itself an object.

Agree that objects can only appear when there's a subject.  When thought
about, the subject gains the characteristics of an object, such as the very
very subtle object that in teaching is often called the "witness."  The
witness is that which "sees" objects.  But really there are no objects and
no subject, and no witness, but only Brahman in identical relation to
Itself, knowing Itself only as Brahman.
