How come you know that you sat still without any thought.  That is, you
have  the consciousness that you don't have any thoughts.  So whenever
you experience anything it is based on your consciouness.

Since anything you experience is based on conciousness, the word
"DEFINITELY NOT CONSCIOUNESSS" IS "DEFINITELY NOT MEANINGLESS".
