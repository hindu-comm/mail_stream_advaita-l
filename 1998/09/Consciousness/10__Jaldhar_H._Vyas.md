The word is misleading but that's because it is a very imperfect
translation as Shrinivas pointed out.  "Pure" consciousness is pragna
or chit.

This may be true of ordinary waking consciousness but What about dreams?
What about the phantom consiousness of a limb that amputees feel?  In each
of these cases the subject-object distinction breaks down.

One huge difference between Buddhists and Advaitins is that we believe
consciousness is continuous while for Vasubandhu et al. consciousness is
kshanika or momentary.  This is because they equate it with what we call
ahamkar.

Then how can you say "this man is the man I met a few years ago"?  (That
example is from Sureshvaracharya's Brhadaranyakopanishadbhshyavartika
btw.)  An opponent could say that implies the existence of memory not
consciousness and that memory is an attribute of the ahamkar.

But then how do you explain how instincts are possible?  If I tap my funny
bone or blink my eyelids obviously there is some kind of consciousness
going on but can you say there is ego?  Do I "remember" to blink each time.

Advaita Vedanta explains these phenomena as being due to an underlying
consciousness.  When that consciousness is broken down into subject and
object, then it is ahamkar.
