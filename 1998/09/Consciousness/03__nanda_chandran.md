I took a look at the thesaurus. Consciousness is equated with all these
words : awareness, mindfulness, cognizance, knowledge. And AFAIK, none
of these words can be explained without a subject and an object.

So please explain the difference between consciousness and being
conscious.

But it should be noted that I didn't deny the existence of the Atman in
my posting. But just that consciousness cannot be equated with the
Atman.
