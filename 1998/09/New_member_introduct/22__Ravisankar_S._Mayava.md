Namaskar!

Thank you for your mail.

My name is Neeraj Gupta, I am an Engineering Graduate currently doing
a post-graduate diploma in management at the Indian Institute of
Management, Calcutta. I belong to the city of Chandigarh.

I have a keen interest in philosophy, particularly classical Indian
Philosophy, particularly Classical Indian Philosophy. I got the
address of your web site while browsing on the net for the same topic.

Though I am quite open to the various schools of thought of Indian
Philosphy, and the interpretations of various thinkers, I am
particularly impressed by the philosophy of the advaita vedanta, even
though I have only a rudiementary knowledge of it. I am slightly
familiar with the Brahma Sutra Bhasya, and this is the main basis of
my interest.

Please send me more details about the activities of Advaita-L.

Neeraj Gupta
