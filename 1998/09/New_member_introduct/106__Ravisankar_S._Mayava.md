Hello, my name is Vidya(shankar) Kaushik and I live in Austin TX.  I have
been studying the vedantic scriptures for more than ten years now through
regular weekly classes and the occasional discourses by visiting teachers
of the Swami Chinmayananda and Swami Dayananda tradition of Arsha Vidya.
We currently have weekly classes in Austin studying the Gita.  I am
interesting in improving my understanding of the advaita teaching and fill
in the gaps in my assimilation of the teaching by discussions with others.
I am hoping to be involved in only those discussions that single-pointedly
lead to clarity of the vision of truth.
