Dear Ravi Mayavaram,

  My name is Gerald Penn.  I work as a research scientist at University of
Tuebingen, in the areas of mathematical logic, philosophy of language and
computer science.  I am particularly interested in the contributions of
advaita to the areas of epistemology and grammar.

Best regards,
Gerald Penn
