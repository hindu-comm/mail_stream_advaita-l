It is a pleasure to see this mailing list growing, with members from
non-English speaking countries too.

If you let me know the publishers of the first book, I might be able to
help in contacting them for details. I think permission to publish a
translation of Krishnaswami Iyer's book can be easily obtained by writing
to the Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya office in Bangalore. If I remember
right, they have the publication rights for all of KAK Iyer's books, as
also the other remarkable books on Advaita Vedanta by the Holenarsipur
Swami.

The Bangalore address, as given to me by Raghavendra, who is also on this
list is -

Adhyaatma Prakaasha Karyaalaya,
No.68,2nd block,
Thyagarajanagar,
Bangalore-560 028.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
