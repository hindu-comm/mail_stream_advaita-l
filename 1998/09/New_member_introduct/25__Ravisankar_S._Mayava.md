Dear Sir,

As hearty welcome to advaita-L.

As such there is no standard transliteration scheme that is
followed in advaita-L. You may choose to follow what is
convenient to you. The one that is used by shrI vidyasankar
sundaresan in his advaita vedAnta page is simple and easy to
follow.

I eagerly look forward to learning from you.

With respects,
Ravi
