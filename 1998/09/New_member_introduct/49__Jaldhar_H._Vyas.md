While this is an important issue between the Advaitins and Mimamsakas, in
the larger scheme of things it amounts to a mere quibble.  Shankaracharya
doesn't deny the validity of vidhis, just restricts their scope.  In other
epistemological topics such as the number and scope of pramanas and how
(and whether) meanings can be known, he completely follows the Mimamsaka
view.

His major philosophical work is Vaiyakaranabhushanakarikas (commented on
in the famous Vaiyakarabhushanasara of Shri Kaunda Bhatt) which teaches
sphotavada which Advaita Vedanta rejects.  Do you know the names of any of
the Advaita works he wrote?  His son Bhanuji took Dashanami Sannyasa under
the name Swami Ramashrama.  And his grandson the famous Nagoji (Nagesh)
Bhatt wrote on Vedanta and Shrividya works.  But I didn't know that
Bhattoji Dikshit himself did.
