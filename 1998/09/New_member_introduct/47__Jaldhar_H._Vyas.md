As far as I know, Advaita Vedanta didn't contribute a lot to those fields.
Rather, they adopted the positions of the Bhatta Mimamsakas almost lock
stock and barrel.  A contemporary of Shankaracharya who later became  his
pupil, Mandana Mishra, combined some details of the sphotavada of the
Grammarians with Advaita Vedanta but this never really went anywhere.
