namaste !

Thank you for your kind welcome.

Just want to tell very frankly I don't consider me at all as a scholar.
I'm just an ordinary sAdhaka,with no University background and a
knowledge of sanskrit limited to the basics acquired  alone a long time
ago with the help of the A.S. Bhandarkar's method, of which I have the
28th edition, dated Indore, 17th,August, 1936. You see  my so called
scholarship is often based on rather old books.    As another example, I
can tell you I have the very first edition of the srImadbhAgavata
pUrANa, translated from Sanskrit into French by Mr Eug√®ne Burnouf upon
request of the Goverment, from a manuscript in the Royal Library, later
National Library ( first volume printed in 1840, fifth volume
firstprinted only in 1898).

P.S.a small detail of no importance in mail. I made a small mistake in
my presentation : trying to indicate how to pronounce my family name, I
should have written verlings' as the w there shoulf sound like the
sanskrit v in vedAnta or vAda an not like v in svAmi or tattva. No
importance,as we only write each anotherce but I always try to be
precise and accurate as much as ever possible. Hope you will not find me
too maniac from the start.
