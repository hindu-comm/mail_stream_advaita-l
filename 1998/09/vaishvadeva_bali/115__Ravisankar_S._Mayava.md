Sometime back question about vaishvadeva bali was raised. More
details on this can be found in shrImad devi bhAgavatam. This
book also contains lot of information regarding sandhyopAsanA,
gAyatrI mantra and the detailed nyAsa for that, and much more
related to the nitya karma-s. The "devi gItA" in this bhAgavatam
is a treasure house. It summarizes important concepts of yoga and
vedAnta.
