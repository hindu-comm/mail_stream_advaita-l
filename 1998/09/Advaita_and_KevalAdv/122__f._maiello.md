hariH OM!

I received this mail yesterday, and was wondering if anyone
had any information pretaining to it.

dhanyavaada,
namaste

Dear Sir,
We are desperately seeking after Rig Veda 9th Mandala translation
into English. It would be certainly an act of mercy from your side
to kindly inform us on where on the WEB we could get it and\or if
you have it?........
We are students-beginners of Sanskrit from Ukraine and Russia.

Sincerely,

On Behalf of the group,
Nikolay Grabchuk
