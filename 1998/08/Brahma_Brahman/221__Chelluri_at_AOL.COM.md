                                                  om
I forgot to add the following in my previous inquiry.

Brahma/Brahman have I think different meanings in different contexts.
For example "Iam (ayam) atma brahma"      Brahma the creator.

Can somebody explain in simple terms what Brahma means in different contexts.
