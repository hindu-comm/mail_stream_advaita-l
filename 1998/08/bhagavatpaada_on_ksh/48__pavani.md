What are all the kshetram-s/temples that the bhagavatpaada
has sung about/mentioned/indicated in his works? In much the
same spirit as the 108 vaishnava divya desam-s sung by the
aazhwaar-s, I am interested in learning about *all* the
temples/kshetram-s mentioned by Sri shankara. I request the
knowledgeable list members to share with us any information
they may have.
Thanks.
