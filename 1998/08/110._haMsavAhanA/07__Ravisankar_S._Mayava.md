110. haMsavAhanA

SHE who has swan as HER vehicle.

The word haMsa is derived from ha.nti, which means "to move".
Hence haMsa means one which moves and it implies Sun or vital
breath.  haMsa is HER symbol as vAhanA in which she is seated.
SHE manifests there.  According to the taittiriyopaniShad.h
(10-4)the puruSha and Sun are one and the same.

Or SHE is sarasvatI  who has swan as  HER vehicle.

AUM haMsavAhanAyai namaH


Note: I numbered the last two names incorrectly as 107 and 108.
They should be incremented by 1.
