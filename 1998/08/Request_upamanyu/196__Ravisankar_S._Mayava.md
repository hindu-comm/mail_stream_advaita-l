In on of the recent mail messages, Rama remarked that when
upamanyu asked Lord shiva for milk, HE gave upamanyu milk ocean
itself.

In shankara dig vijaya, shrI AryAmba also refers upamanyu when
shankara's father shrI shivaguru worries about not having a
child. She tell him that Lord shiva is a  kalpataru, HE will
fulfil the needs of his devotees, do not you remember the
incident related to upamanyu?

Can someone tell me more about shrI upamanyu?

With respects,
Ravi
