  A+ vR^it.h in the causative, as you have correctly shown, is the
  origin of Avartayet.h, which has the potential or optative tense,
  technically called liN^.h The meaning of AvartanaM, for example,
  is going around, revolving or in this case, more appropriately
  repeating.

  The origin of the saying, I honestly don't know. It must be from
  a smR^iti, as in the case of another smR^iti statement quoted by
  BhaTTa BhAskara in his shrIrudrabhAShya:

  chamakaM namakaM chaiva paurushhasUktaM tathaiva cha  |
  nityaM trayaM prayuJNjAno brahmaloke mahIyate       ||

  One who practises the three -- the namakaM (Rudram), chamakaM,
  and the Purushha sUkta-- daily becomes great in Brahmaloka.

  Anyway, it is clear that the first verse above AND this one cannot
  both be injunctions!

 The nityakarmas that are accepted are the snAna, sandhyA,
  gAyatrI japa, devapUjA, vaishvadeva and Atithya. One can
  perhaps include the Rudram-chamakam and Purushha sUkta in the
  devapUjA part, but this is open to interpretation. I am unable to
  say for sure but I am inclined to think that at least the three
  -- Rudra-chamaka and PuruSha sUkta-- are as good as being part
  of the nitya karmas.

  In any case, I wasn't so much saying that the Rudram-chamakam
  _must_ be recited as saying that it _may_ be recited  by anyone
  regardless of the shAkhA (after having learnt it). Perhaps, as you
  have led me to think, it might indeed be part of the nitya karmas.

  As you have said,  this matter may require clarification from
  some authority in India.
