Btw, I did not mean to imply that all South Indians are Krishnayajurvedis
only that all Krishnayajurvedis are South Indian.

Judging from the families I know, amongst Gujaratis it is about 80%
Shuklayajurveda (Madhyandina Shaka), 15% Samavedis (Kauthuma Shakha), 5%
Rgveda. I don't know of any who study Atharvaveda.  But the Bhagavata
Vidyapitha (a pathashala in Gujarat)  has trained students in Atharvaveda.
I think I read in one of their publications that they have several
shastris on staff who know it.

As to why Yajuraveda in all its forms is the most popular (it has the most
shakas too), I think because it most closely follows the order of the
Yajnas it is the most "practical".  But the fact the other Vedas are also
still prevalent today shows our ancestors were concerned with duty as well
as practicality.

This is an interesting theory and one which I believe has merit because
there are certaince small linguistic differences in Gujarati in
different parts of Gujarat wich coincides with the level of study of the
people there.

Amongst South Indians.  Whereas amongst Gujaratis and North Indians
Shastris are almost invariably Shuklayajurvedis.

I was remarking to Subhanu that it is a duty to study ones own shakha.
But whether it is better to study the "wrong" Veda rather than no Veda I
don't know.  Let's hope we don't need to make such choices.
