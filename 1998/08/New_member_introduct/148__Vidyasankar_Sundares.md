Wouldn't brahmaloke mahIyate be only an arthavAda, meant to eulogise the
person who acts thus? The earlier verse, which uses the form Avartayet, is
much simpler to view as an injunction. There is one school of mImAMsA
interpretation which would say that there is an injunction implied in the
arthavAda also,  but there is another school which would require a direct
statement of injunction, as in svargakAmI yajet, etc.
