Re: vedAdhyayana - the injunction is not that *only* one's own SAkhA
should be studied, but normally one makes a beginning with it. So, this is
not a restrictive injuction (niyama-vidhi) or an excluding injunction
(parisaMkhyA-vidhi). If it had been otherwise, it would be inconceivable
that SankarAcArya wrote commentaries on the upanishads of all four Vedas.
But there is always room for new precedent, dictated by exceptional
circumstances.
