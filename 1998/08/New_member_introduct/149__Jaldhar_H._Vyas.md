They may not have said that explicitly as "everyone knows" you are
supposed to study your own Shakha but there is no dout that was what
people believed.  For example in his Shankara digvijaya, Swami Vidyaranya
explains that Sureshvaracharya wrote vartikas on the
Brhadaranyakopanishad and Taittiriyopanishad bhashyas because his teacher
(i.e. Shankaracharya) belonged to Taittiriya Shakha of
Krishnayajuraveda and he belonged to Kanva Shakha of Shuklayajuraveda.

no one is saying this.  The idea is the ancestral Shakha should be studied
*first*.  Ideally one should master all four.

As Ramakrishnan mentioned, my wifes maiden name was Dave which is a
prakrit version of Dvivedi so I am aware of this.  But I also discovered
in the process of arranging my marriage that many families who haven't
studied Vedas for several generations do have this notion of belonging to
a particular shakha.

For smartas at least, Shishtachara is just as valid a source of Dharma as
Shruti and Smrti.  And given that the practice of learning your own Shakha
is the accepted norm (Even amongst non-Smartas) it is as binding an
injunction as any.
