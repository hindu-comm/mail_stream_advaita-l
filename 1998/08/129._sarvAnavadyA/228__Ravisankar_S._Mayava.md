129. sarvAnavadyA

SHE  has faultless attributes of knowledge and wealth. avadya
means ignorance, that is, without knowledge. It indicates mithyaa
or falsehood and it can be destroyed by knowldge. anavadya means
"not avadya"  SHE is anavadya because, SHE is existence,
knowledge and bliss. This is opposite to mithyaa or falsehood.

Or this name can mean that SHE is to be praised because SHE
grants boons to all.
