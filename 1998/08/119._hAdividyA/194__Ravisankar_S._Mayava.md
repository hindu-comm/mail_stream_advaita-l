It should read as bilva aShTottara shata nAmAvaliH. Incidentally
the same group have also chanted shrI lalitA sahasranAmam, it is
also available in UT (University of Texas at Austin) Library.
There rendering is very traditional and nice.

shrI bilva aShTottara shata nAmAvaliH which is attributed to shrI
shankara is very sweet and uplifting to hear. I do not know
whether Jaguar Sanksrit site has this text.

With respects
