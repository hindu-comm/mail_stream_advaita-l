Namaste.

As Shri Sadananda is presently away from the List, I like to take up the
debate. I feel rather lonely defending this line of thought and would
request Shri Sadananda and Shri f.meillo to re-appear. In the following,
>> refer to Shri Sadananda's comments and > refer to Shri Jaladhar Vyas'.

But, is there a *definition* of moksha ?  By defining, we are limiting it
to be bound within the definition. But moksha is ananta, the infinite, the
undefinable bliss. I do not think the Upanishhads ever defined moksha in
terms of the explainable. If it is, I would certainly like to see
reference to it.

As I understand it (again, I would request members to look at this
rationally and ponder over it): mental sannyAsa (renunciation) is all
there is. Does it make a difference whether the entity wears a grihastha
garb or a sannyAsi garb ? In what way are the grihastha or sannyAsi garbs
different than say a mole on the cheek ?

The only renunciation that the scriptures talk of is the mental
renunciation (MahAnArAyanopanishhad, kaivalyopanishhad). We can arrive at
that from various routes (i) by doing nitya karmAs in a sense of
dispassion, (ii) by complete and unqualified surrender to personal God
with the firm belief that the personal God will lead us to moksha.

I fully agree with that interpretation of the essence of gitA. But let us
also keep this in perspective. There are karmAs designated for any one who
is embodied (or for anyone who feels that he/she is embodied and who
thinks that the physical form is the boundary for that entity). For a
grihastha, there are nitya karmAs (shhaTkarmANi dine dine), for a
sannyAsa, there are other karmAs designated. No one can give up action as
long as they think they are limited by the embodiment.  If we accept that,
the whole debate may be unnecessary.

Yes, everything involves action. One cannot deny it. Even a sannyAsa has
to perform action (may be different from a tax return, but still action
nevertheless)

But who is this renouncer of karma (action) ?

In my understanding, renounciation is mental renounciation only. Quite
often it has been derided on this list with sarcastic comments like
"... People have mentally renounced everything, but they can enjoy the
paycheques etc ...".  Mental renounciation or renounciation is a gradual
evolution process. As the entity evolves into that stage, the entity may
take the external garb of sannyAsa, or may not. But that is not
renounciation yet. The entity's evolution has to be such that it does not
make any difference whatever garb that is worn, how other people view that
entity, the results of the actions do not matter... Are other people's
judgement on this matter any important ? No, not for a true renounciate.
