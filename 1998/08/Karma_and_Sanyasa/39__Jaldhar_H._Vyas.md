Vidyashankar has provided it.  No definition of it will be
all-encompassing but we must have some idea of it or we wouldn't even be
able to talk about it.  And this idea we get from Shruti not from logic or
perception.

By physical sannyasa it is not meant certain clothes, items etc.  What is
meant is the renunciation of action.

In many places the shastras talk of the physical renunciation of actions.
Again, Vidyashankar has mentioned some.  See also Ishopanishad where it
says by karma one can live in this world for 100 years but these worlds
are "asura" and the people there kill the self.

All a sannyasi is required to do is the minimum necessary to keep his body
functioning.  A householder on the other hand is required to do
more--which requires the notion of "I am doing."  Yesterday was Shravani or
Balev when Brahmans change their yagnopavits.  I took the morning off from
work but I couldn't just go off on a whim.  I had to inform my boss etc.
A householder is too tightly bound in this web of obligations to be able
to claim to renounce anything.

But the key is only the _minimum_ amount of action.

See Vidyashankars answer to this.

Because most of the people who think mental sannyasa absolves them of
responsibility are fools and deserve derision.

Renounciation is mental you are right.  But the mental renunciation
includes the physical.

A high school freshman might dream of going to medical school.  But until
he graduates from medical school he cannot call himself a doctor.  Neither
can he say to his history teacher "I didn't do my homework because I'm
going to be a doctor and won't need history."
