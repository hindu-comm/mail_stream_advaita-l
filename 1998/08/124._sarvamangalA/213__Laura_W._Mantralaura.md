sarvebhyo namaH,
  I am going to be moving in a couple  of days and will be close
to Arsha Vidya GurukulaM. Then I will see Pujya Swami Dayananda,
Swami Tadatmananda, and all the other friends there. So, I will be
offline after tomorrow until Oct.
  May I be in all of your hearts as you are in mine. Hopefully, we will
meet in person someday.
  Ravi, please take me off the list until I am set up in my new location
in Oct.  Thank you for your patience and perserverance in maintaining
this list.

dhanyavaadaH,
  Mantralaura
