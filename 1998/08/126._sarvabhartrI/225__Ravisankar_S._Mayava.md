Sri Gurubhyo Namaha!


 Namaste,
          I am Srinivasan.k (my name). I have just completed my B.E in
comp sc (1998 april) and iam working as a software professional in
Indigo technologies.

          From my young age i have always been fascinated by our
religion and its rich culture. Especially our Bhakthi tradition and
Philosophy.

          But i would say , it was 4-5 yrs back i became associated with
kanchi shankara Mutt. I used stay for three-fivedays every semister
during my college life.

         Before that i used learn slokas and as my istha devatha is
*Ambal* , i collected lots of details about various manthra satras
relating to Ambal and used to discuss with people who r expert in it.

          Slowly i started learning about shankara's Bhaja govindam More
than the song , i contemplated on its meaning. And that was my entry in
advaita vedanta. Later i can quote some books which boosted my interest
in advaita (Like Deivathin Kural by Paramacharya, Advaita Deepika, Atma
Bodha etc.)

          Currently iam learining Shankaras Tattva Bodha , a very
valuble one.

          As i was searching in the net for some info , I found this
mailing list .So i thought this would be very good oppurtunity for
learning and discussing more about Shankara 's brilliant works.



With love
Srinivasan k
