You definitely are getting confused between "consciousness" and
"being conscious". Please examine the definitions more closely.

The consciousness in the above list obviously is chitta and not the Atman.
In which case your definition of "consciousness" above can be admitted, but
this has got nothing to do with Atman or Brahman.

That is true when there is no chitta-suddhi. Not in the case of a chitta
that is completely purified.

Yes, it happens because of all the past tendencies and the chitta is not
purified yet. You should refer to Yogasutras of Patanjali. It is a very
good manual for meditation.

Pranayama is one of the ways of stilling the chitta-vrittis. But that alone
wont do. It has to be supplemented with pratyahara, dharana, dhyana and
samadhi. Only then complete purification can result.

Not quite.  The 'I' which is a thought is nothing but the ego. One has to be
very careful with the ways of the ego since it masquerades as the subject
(no doubt based on all the reading done before). The "Self"(with a capital S)
is not a mere convenience to explain a concept without invoking absurdity.

Since your definition of consciousness suffers from error, you are getting
into all sorts of confusion. Rectify it and you will see that there is no
confusion of any sort. Also stick to your meditation practice and do
verify your progress with that mentioned in the texts. I am sure you will
attain the goal, which is chitta-suddhi.

Srinivas Sista.
