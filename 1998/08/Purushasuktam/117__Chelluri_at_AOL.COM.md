                                               om

In one of the mantras near the end it was mentioned

"hreeschatye Lakshmi'scha  patnyu"

I understand patni refers to female.  What is the meaning of "Lakshmischya
Patnayu".   Could some one explain.

Thanks                                                           Nagy
