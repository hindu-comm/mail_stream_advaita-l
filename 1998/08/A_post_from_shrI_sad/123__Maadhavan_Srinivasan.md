If we are true advaitins, we can see the existence of advaita principle
in all the sampradaayaas or religions. So, it is not necessary to
realize that other sampradayas are lower level than Advaita Vedanta.

Let us concentrate on Advaita Vedanta, which transcend
sampradayas,country,religion and all other differences.

Madhavan.
