 This is a part of the discussion of HH on verse 11 of the
vivekachUdAmani. I could not fully understand the reference to the "weak
boat" at that time. Now, by His grace, I have come across a
meaning/discussion of the PraNavam AUM. It greatly clarifies the
reference. The following is from the Siva Purana. Ch 17. ver. 2 - 8

 The symbol AUM means an excellent boat to cross the ocean of worldy
exixtence. Pra = of the Prakrti i.e., the world evolved out of it. Navam -
nAvAm varam - an excellent boat.

 Or Pranava may mean: "that which leads to new knowledge". After
annihilating all actions it gives the persons who repeat the mantra or
worship, a fresh knowledge of the pure soul.

 There is a great deal said about the primordial relevance/significance/
importance of the PraNavam. I have come across a few in the Siva PuraNa,
once where Siva Himself explains it to Vishnu and Brahma after their
fight, and a second time when Suta Brahmam is explaining it to the
Brahmins he is telling the Siva PuraNa to. I will try and post some of it
in later posts.
 I also request members to find time to discuss the relevance or other
interpretations of AUM in this forum. I am also especially interested the
method of intonation: is it to be said aloud, or meditated upon etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The place, time, objects and their knower etc., projected in a dream
during sleep are all mithyA (an illusion/false). So too, here. in the
waking state, the world that is seen is a projection by one's own
ignorance. Likewise, this body, the senses, the breath, the ego etc.,
are all unreal. Therefore, That thou art, the peaceful, defectless,
supreme, non-dual Brahman.  -- Adi Shankara in VivekacUdAmani.
