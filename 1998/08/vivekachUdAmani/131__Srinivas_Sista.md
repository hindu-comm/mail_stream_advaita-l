I too came across the same classification. When I was initiated into
the Mrityunjaya mantra, my guru told me that in the initial stages one
should do japa aloud so that the shabda swaroopa is fixed firmly. Later
only with the lips moving so that the nuances in sound are clearly perceived
eventhough they are not uttered aloud. Then one will be fit to take on
pure mental repetition without losing the mantra form.
(I, being a monkey, experimented with the reverse order and did find that
he was right :-))
