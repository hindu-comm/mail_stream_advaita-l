Do not confuse the finger pointing at the moon with the moon itself.

Discriminating between the Light and what It illuminates -- activity
(rajas) and objects (tamas) -- is crucial.

The Light reveals Itself to Itself as Itself, not to the student (or
any "other" which is the illuminated).

Quite so.  Now practice discriminating between the Light and that which
is illuminated/activated (the body/mind).

The path starts with avoiding habitual actions, then avoiding forbidden
actions and only performing allowed/enjoined actions, and so on; at
each step it reduces the attachment/valuation to activity/objects and
brings the mind to some sort of rest and detachment (i.e. increases sattva).
When there is sufficient sattva, one can start to discriminate between the
Seer and the seen, and simply observe the play of the guNa-s, the senses
playing among the sense-objects.  Finally, there is just Knowledge, both
latent and patent.

That link is the problem: it is called avidyA.  Concentrate rather
on the Light that is common to both.

Learn??  You do not need to acquire anything: just get rid of the
acquisitions that you already have!  Moksha is freedom from the
limitations that we impose on the Self by identifying with actions
and objects (nAma and rUpa).

To whoever claims it.

Because it is not there.  There is Knowledge, and Its manifestation.
pUrNamadaH pUrNamidaM ... Nothing else, no limitation, no identification.

It is the natural state, pure perfect and complete, with no "other"
to cause fear agitation desire and so on.  That's what you are when
you finally give up all attachments to the limitations.

So I understand occasionally.  :-)
