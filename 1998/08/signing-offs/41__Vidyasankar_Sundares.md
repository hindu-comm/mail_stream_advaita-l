I second this. Isn't it understandable now why SankarAcArya insists upon
Sama, dama, uparati, titikshA, vairAgya etc? Understanding Advaita is
often like tight-rope walking, we all need enormous amount of self-control
in it. I would request everybody to observe some restraint for a while.

Best regards,
