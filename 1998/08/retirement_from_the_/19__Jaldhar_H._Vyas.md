Ramakrishna wasn't an Advaitin and the organization that claims to be his
followers is virtually devoid of Advaita content.  I've said that and
until I see some evidence to the contrary, I'll keep saying that.  But
I've never said Ramakrishna wasn't a nice man or didn't have any good
qualities.  Amongst my gurus is a Vishishtadvaitin. I respect him very
much but I don't call him an Advaitin.  The Mandir I usually go to is
affiliated with Vallabhas sampradaya.  It's a nice place but Advaita is
not taught there.  Similiarly I know a lot about other religions.  I
appreciate some of their contents.  But that doesn't mean that I think
they are all mystically part of Advaita Vedanta.

I respect people who think differently from me for what they are rather
than what I think they ought to be or what they pretend to be.  This
actually makes me more tolerant and broad-minded than any of the so-called
eclectics.
