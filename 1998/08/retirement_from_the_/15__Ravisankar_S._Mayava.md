I agree with you on what you say. This is list if for the
discussion on advaita vedanta taught by shrI shankara. If we keep
the focus on that, every minute spent of the list will become
very very valuable. As you pointed out shrI Anand's example, mail
messages of that quality make one to read and re-read to
understand it completely.

I request the members to focus their attention on shrI shankara's
teachings.
