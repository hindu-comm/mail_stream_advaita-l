Not sure whether this is relevant to the list, but there is an advaita
teacher named Dr. Vijai S. Shankar coming to New York City this August from
Galveston, Texas.  I don't know who his living teacher is, but he is
supposedly a jivanmukta, inspired by the teachings of Ramana and
Nisargadatta.  There are articles about him in Asian Age and Indo-American
News.  If it is appropriate, I can post the meeting info here.  If not, I'm
sorry and you can e-mail me privately if interested.
