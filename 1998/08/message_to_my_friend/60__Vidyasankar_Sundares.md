Not necessarily. There is the general principle of saMnyAsa and there is
what is right for a particular person. The latter should be an
individual's undertaking, guided by a proper guru. There are many
saMnyAsins who will advise most people against becoming saMnyAsins. This
does not mean that they advise against the very principle of saMnyAsa. One
can still embark upon the jnAnamArga, without the physical saMnyAsa. But
then, the ideal has to be kept alive, so that there is no reason to argue
against it.

There are two things here, abiding in the Self, and discharging duties.
The former may not interfere with the latter, but the latter will most
probably interfere with the former. That is why, for some people, physical
saMnyAsa helps, by providing opportunities to cultivate mental saMnyAsa.
For others, it may not be necessary, but these are the ones who are in no
need of a practical strategy. However, it is also easy to be deluded into
thinking that one has truly renounced, and shirking one's duties thereby.
By providing for physical saMnyAsa and its associated niyamas, one
provides for checks and balances against potential abuse. That is why one
sees the veneration for the monk, in almost every religious tradition.

Yes indeed, there is still the momentum of prArabdha karma for the
jIvanmukta. However, true actionlessness can also apply to the jIvanmukta,
so long as there is no identification with the body. Otherwise, one is
giving too much value to mere physical death.

Which brings me to this question - in what way does the videhamukti of a
jIvanmukta differ from the death of an ignorant man? The answer to this
question determines many things in one's view in this entire debate.
