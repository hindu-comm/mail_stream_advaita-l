I differ here. It is not a mental factor that accounts for not identifying
with the body, but it is mano-nASa. In this situation, it is the Atman
(not the mind) that does not identify itself with the body, and there is
no more individual, and no more mind. The Atman does not need any
instrument to not identify with the body, as it simply abides in its own
nature.

Again we get to the crux of the issue. "nirguNa" brahman is superior to
"saguNa" brahman only inasmuch as language falls short of the true nature
of consciousness. It is not that "nirguNa" brahman is one thing and
"saguNa" another. In my understanding, there is no point in saying "both
are purely brahman." Such a statement makes nirguNa-tva itself into a
guNa, which is obviously not the case. The truth of the matter is that
there is only one brahman, which is beyond guNas, but which seems to be
saguNa to the limited intellect. The same analysis goes for actionlessness
and desireless action, which is why I hold that the former is a higher
value that gives meaning to the latter.

Yes, they are fundamentally equivalent. However, in some ways, talking of
jIvanmukti has to be paradoxical in nature, which is not the case for
talking of actionlessness and desireless action.
