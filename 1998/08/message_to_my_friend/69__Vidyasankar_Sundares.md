In what sense does one regard the world as not apart from brahman? Does
one see only brahman here, or does one see the multiplicity of the
universe? Or does one see the multiplicity of the universe as part and
parcel of the one brahman? In which case, isn't brahman always divisible
into parts? Then how does one logically interpret the testimony of the
Sabda, that there is no multiplicity here (neha nAnAsti kiMcana), and that
brahman is really partless and indivisible?

All Advaita Vedanta teaching lies in the resolution of these questions
only. That is why it is said that there is brahman as the real foundation
(adhishThAna/pratishThA). However, this does not necessarily mean that the
multiple universe based on this real foundation thereby becomes real.
