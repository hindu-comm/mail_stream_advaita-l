But you're not there you're here.  So the situation there is irrelevant.

No, once you're there it is arbitrary.  Once again I remind you, you are
not there.  So your above statement is a non sequiter.  You cannot
arbitrary flip-flop between two different scales of measurement.  It would
be as absurd as asking how many pints to a mile.

And if the temperament of the individual is to booze and drugs, partaking
of those becomes a "strategy" I suppose.  Basing sadhana on what "I" find
convenient is the very opposite of Vedanta.

So you say.  Can your words be trusted?  Without any independant means of
verification they cannot.  Even by you.

Are we sure this hypothetical 20% are even Advaitins in the first place?
Or is an Advaitin anyone who says he is one?  In any case is a popularity
contest the right means for deciding truth?

You see the beauty of logic as Vidyashankar is using, is that it does not
depend on him only on facts.  It remains true if 100%, 40% or even no one
finds it suitable. That's why it is truth.   That's why he is right and
you're wrong.

How do we know your approach delivers the same goods?
