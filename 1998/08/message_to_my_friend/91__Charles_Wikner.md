Answer #1: NO.  For how many millions of embidiments have you not
known the contents of this post?  Now that ignorance is at an end.

Answer #2: YES. Ignorance has neither beginning nor end.  It doesn't
have a middle either!  (unless you are fooled by appearances :-)

The first answer is slick sophistry (there is no specific cause for
that particular ignorance); the second is advaita (GK 2:6, 4:31).
