I'll let others answer for themselves, but as far as I can see, those who
were upholding physical saMnyAsa were not denying the place of mental
saMnyAsa. My point is that the niyamas of physical saMnyAsa can help
prepare the mind/individual for the ultimate state of actionlessness.

Even in the case of vAmadeva, who was born a jnAnI, he acquired
brahman-knowledge when in the womb, no? This is a rare case, isn't it?
