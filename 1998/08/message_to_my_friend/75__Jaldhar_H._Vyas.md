Ok, I can accept that. Though it doesn't make any difference to the
subject under discussion.  The fact still remains that prarabdha karma
cannot be used to justify action on the part of a would-be mumukshu.  At
best it explains the tendancy to be more or less involved in karma.  A
person with a proclivity to renunciation still has to actually renounce at
some point.

This is also plausible.  But such an interpretation is even further from
the idea that Ramana is praising mental over physical sannyasa.
