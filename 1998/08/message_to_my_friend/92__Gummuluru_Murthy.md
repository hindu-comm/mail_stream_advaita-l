Thanks for your comment.

I like your answer # 2. Adau ante ca yAn nAsti, vartamAnepi tat tathA.
This applies not only to avidya, but to everything, all jeevas etc {If we
take all jeevas as part of avidyA, then that implies with what we see in
vyavahArika is all avidyA).

That is, avidyA is never there; there is only jnAnam.
But people may argue this is paramArtha view and not intellectual
understanding.

Answer # 1

I see the answer # 1 as the lower knowledge (as per MuNDAka upanishhad
classification of para and apara). When you say "...Now, that ignorance
is at an end...", I take it what was obtained there is the lower
knowledge.

Answer which we have got to see as part of us is answer # 2.

Then, is it necessary at all to say that avidyA is anAdi (even
intellectually) ? I am using the word anAdi here in the colloquial way
that is used in parts of south India meaning from time immemorial.
