        That is largely true, as you say further on in your mail (some
excellent stuff, that I have deleted from this posting).
However, the statement that I was questioning (in Frank Maiello's posting)
was related to advaita vedAnta being viewed as a strategic philosophy
that endeavours to take the jIva out of the present state of ajnAna. The
idea being (or atleast that is how I understand it) that such an
approach leads us to jnAna (referred to as the final state or simply
"there") and that the crutch (or the raft) can then be thrown away. The
implicit reasoning being that since many such crutches are available and
they all lead to the same state, they should all be equivalent.  Since
they are manifestly not, they should have nothing to do with the final
state at all -- hence to be treated as discardable.  My objection to this
statement is that it is based on premises that are unproven (either
empirically or logically). Therefore the only strategy that seems
foolproof is to follow a school of thought completely to wherever it leads
, while believing that it describes the truth as completely as it claims
to. The reality that it describes then remains true throughout, what
changes is the doubting nature of the mind.
