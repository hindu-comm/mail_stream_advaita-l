        Yes, but isn't this human nature simply a manifestation of mental
conditioning? Isn't the slate wiped out clean when jnAna is attained? So
what truth lies in these experiences other than that similar experiences
lead to similar feelings. But since attainment of jnAna is not an
experience, rather a dissolution of the experiencing structure, how can
you extrapolate this similarity?

Clearly there is a difference in the kind of similarity that you can
attribute to these statements and to ones like: "I have a toothache",
spoken in different languages.  The difference can be extracted in the
following way. Since toothache is an experience it has been captured by
thought and is therefore common knowledge.  All statements can therefore
be seen through this knowledge and judged to be similar or dissimilar. It
makes perfect sense for the human mind to do such a thing.
But since, neither the "atmAn" nor the "Father" can be experienced what
meaning is to be attributed to this assumed similarities?

        Sorry for being unclear here. You have interpreted the question
correctly though.
