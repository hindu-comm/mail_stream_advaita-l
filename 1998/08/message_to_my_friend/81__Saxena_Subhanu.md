If you look in Shankara's famous introduction to the Brahma Sutra's, he
says at the end "evam anaadirananto naisargiko adhyaasaha,
mithyaapratyayaroopaha, kartrtwa bhoktrtwa pravartakaha, sarvoloka
pratyakshaha"-"And thus there is this inate, beginningless, endless
Adhyaasa (superimposition of the real on the not real), which is of the
form of a false conception of reality, and the impeller of the notions
of being a doer and and enjoyer".  Earlier in the Adhyaasa bhashyam,
Shankara defines Adhyaasa as Avidya.

Hope this gives you a helpful quotation

Regards

Subhanu Saxena
