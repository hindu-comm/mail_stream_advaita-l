If so, why didn't Janaka physically renounce his kingdom?

Not really.  The mind observes its own byproduct [of the world]--which,
in this context is established by drishti-srishti vaada--in its waking
mode; and also observes its own byproduct in dreams.  In this sense--in
either case--it isn't really turning inward.  What Bhagavan RM is
referring
to by turning the mind inward, is tracing the nature of mind to its
source,
being the Substratum or Self, which is the marga of atmavichara.
