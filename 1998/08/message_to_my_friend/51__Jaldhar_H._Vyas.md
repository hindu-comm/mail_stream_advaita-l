That's irrelevant for several reasons.

1.  We are discussing Advaita Vedanta as taught by Shankaracharya so it
doesn't matter if all jnanis agree or not.  Only the jnanis of
Shankaracharyas tradition count.

2.  Even then there is some room for disagreement but if you look closely,
you see there is great agreement on a lot of issues.  For those issues we
can certainly make judgements without fear of bing rash.

3.  A disagreemnt, to be worthy of consideration must have some substance.
Everyone has opinions but not all opinions are worth anything.  If that's
not the case we should just abandon the list and start watching talk
shows.  They are certainly full of "controversy."

Really?  Then lets see the sources.  In the recent discussion I had with
Sadananda I could at least understand where he is coming from.  Your posts
seem to be nothing more than your opinion which to be blunt doesn't carry
a lot of weight.  By showing where and how you reached a certain
conclusion, you become more believable.

This why Avaita Vedanta is called a sampradaya.  A succession of teachers.
We look not at one particular link but the whole tradition to come to a
conclusion.  And in doing so we note that Advaita Vedanta overwhelmig
rejects the idea that mental sannyasa is all that's needed.  As for
Ramana, looking back on the last 20 or so messages I don't see him being
invoked to support the idea that physical sannyasa isn't needed.  And I
also note that he was a sannyasi himself.

No we are not.  Because again I remind you this list is for Advaita
Vedanta as taught by Shankaracharya.  This is who we are inclined to give
credence to.

Why should anyone clean up after your mess?  If your posts are erroneous
don't make them.  Make non-erroneous ones instead.

I've never called for anyone to leave the list because I would rather they
changed their ways instead.  What list members are being asked to do is
well within the grasp of everyone.
