No, more participation is welcome. This is not an intrusion at all. If I
remember right, one of your posts was the motivation behind this
discussion.

The only thing to realize here is that it is the mumukshu who "graduates"
into the jIvanmukta, if not in this lifetime, in some other, future one.
Nobody is born a jIvanmukta without first having been a mumukshu. Now, all
of this assumes birth and death, so that yes, we are speaking of the
subtle body here. So, clearly, vyAvahArically speaking, actionlessness is
a higher value than desireless action. The crucial thing to note is that
all speaking is vyavahAra, so one has to acknowledge the higher value. For
the jIvanmukta, "to act or not to act" - the question does not arise; for
that matter, no question arises.

Vidyasankar
