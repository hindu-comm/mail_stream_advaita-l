Thank you malileo for expressing the ideas which i have. In my point of
view, Jesus and Buddha are Jeevan Mukthas like Adhi Sankara.

Regards
Madhavan.

Your observation supports that the apparant restrcitions in Vedic
Traditions  are always subject to practicality and commonsense. The
purpose of certain imposed restrictions was to maintain discipline but
there are exceptions to rules and regulations.  When niyama-vidhis of
rituals are violated, they can be rectified by additional rituals
(pariharams or prayacithams).  I have seen my father (Vidhihar by
profession) conducting prayachitha rituals to rectify wrong doings.

Sringeri and Kanchi Madathipathis (heads of the Sankara Mutts) are
always very compassionate to the devotees when they get requests for
relaxing restrictions due to unforeseen family circumstances.  Few years
back, one of our relatives wanted to have marriage alliance with a
family from a different tradition and sent a letter to Sringeri Mutt for
approval.  The request was approved  and almost all such requests are
treated very sympathetically.  However, Acharyas will never publically
endorse breaking traditions because such a stand will break the
tradition and develop discipline.  Acharyas are very compassionate sages
who do not mind to BEND but will never allow to break!

I find an analogy between learning "own SAkha" and native language
(mathrubhasha).  Most of us made our beginning with our own language and
have also learnt other languages.  Some second and third generation
Indian kids have better command over English than their native
language!  It is quite conceivable that some kids from India may know
more non-native languages such as English, Spanish, German, etc. and
very little of their native languages.  We live neither in Vedic time
period nor in a Vedic society and we have to understand and appreciate
our limitations.

I have a curious question for the readers of the list.  I am only
familiar with the works of Adi Sankaracharya in Sanskrit.  Does anyone
know any written works of Sankaracharya in any southindian languages?

Finally, let me take this opportunity to welcome Shri Subhanu Saxena to
this list.  Your biographical sketch is very inspirational and thank you
for sharing with all of us.  I see the Grace of Saraswathi in your
expression, Vedica and language skills.  I am delighted to see your
statement: "Aa no bhadraaha kratavo yantu vishwataha. Let noble thoughts
come to us from every side."  I am looking forward see the articles that
you mentioned in your biographical sketch.
