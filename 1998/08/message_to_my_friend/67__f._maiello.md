The statements: "As long as one is embodied (or thinks, is embodied),
is not there action all the time ?" and  "actionlessness is there only
for jnAnam in embodied form," appear to be incompatible.  I maintain
that
true actionlessness only applies to videhamukthi and not jivanmukthi.
Although it's critical to understand that the jivanmuktha is utterly
dispassionate to Its actions, nevertheless Its body is still
functioning, even if merely the heart and lungs are at work.

And, if I may say, excellent outline/commentary on the comparative death
experiences of the jnani, ajnani, and student of advaita.
