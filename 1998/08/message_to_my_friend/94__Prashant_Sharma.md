        The point I am trying to make is that whatever one thinks about
the "other state" is because, and in terms of, some existing philosophy.
There is no "proof" that there is some other state of being, independent
of what a philosophy defines that to be. It is therefore quite clear that
only one philosophy can get you "there". Some other school of thought will
lend itself to an approach that shall take one somewhere else. So, as long
as we are going places let us ride the same bus. The possibility that we
arrive at the same place is not ruled out, but it is not proven either.

        Which didn't make the end result any different did it?

Vaidya,

Some authorities are of the opinion that pure praNava should be chanted
only by sannyAsis. Some others think anyone can. However all are agreed
upon the fact that only after initiation by a guru, praNava can be
chanted or made japa of. In any case, the guru will properly instruct
while giving upadesha. It's better not to learn pronunciation, etc from
books or from discussion forums. It does not serve much purpose anyway,
since without upadesha it cannot be chanted.

The praNava has deep significance. It is split into the three letters a,
u and m.h which stand for vishva, taijasa and prAGYa respectively. The
mANDUkya upanishhad, the gauDapAda kArika-s and the bhAshhya of
sha.nkarAchArya are very useful in understanding this. Please refer to
that. I'll try to summarize their points when I get the time.

Rama.

I appreciate your concern for the vedas and propogation of it. I also
agree with you that studying some veda is better than not studying any
at all. However in the very kR^ishhNa yajur veda you are studying it is
said:

svAdhyAyAnmA pramadaH |

One's own veda should be studied. While this is not interpreted as a
rule by advaitins (it occurs in the upanishhads), it is certainly
treated as a suggestion. And that's only the tradition we have been
following all this time also. This tradition is not restricted to
advaitins: all dvaitins, vishishhTAdvaitins also follow it.

Jaldhar also is from the UK (I think he was born there) and has made
study of the shukla yajurveda. Perhaps he can offer you suggestions on
who to contact.

You should not think the view that ones own shAkha should be studied
first is "parochial". Such a characterization is quite subjective. For
eg, all advaita teachers are of the view that drinking, taking drugs,
etc is not conducive to spiritual welfare. Should we condemn such a view
as parochial? We should take it in the right spirit. Jaldhar is not
saying other vedas are bad and only shukla yajurveda is good. It is just
that the vedas themselves say that one's own shAkha should be given
preference and has been accepted by all our teachers. So, if we have
faith in them we should abide by them.

However if it's impossible to get a teacher for shuklayajur veda, it
would be better to read some other veda than none at all.

Rama
