Oh, I did not mean the question is unfair in a negative sense. If I did
give that impression, my apologies.

What I meant was:

The answer to your question is:  Yes, the world is real.
Can there be any other answer to it in the vyavahArika ?
[But that answer is untrue in paramArtha. I used that as an example
where the conclusion drawn by the intellect based on logic fails in
the end. That does not mean, we do not use the intellect, but recognize
the limitation of it.]

I used the VC verse to show that the jagat is a mahA svapna *only*
in the paramArtha.

I think you would agree with the above two statements.

I commented on Shri Shankara's "impeccable" logic:  Shri Shankara in VC
made the disciple say that jagat is in mahA svapna only after the
disciple's realization and not before realization. That is an
important difference in my view and shows the beauty of Shri
Shankara's writings and teachings.

If my understanding of this verse is wrong, or if I mis-interpreted
Shri Shankara, I welcome your comment and clarification.
