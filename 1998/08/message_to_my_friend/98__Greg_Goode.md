Jumping in here.  Picking up on your ideas that only one philosophy can get
you "there," and that another philosophy will take you somewhere else.  One
of the things that all non-dual philosophies are in agreement about (though
with different words) is this: there are no two "theres" for there to be.
So how can any of these philosophies take you to any *other* place?
