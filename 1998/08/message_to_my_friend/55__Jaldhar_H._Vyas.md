Please note the discussion wasn't exactly "mental vs physical".  Mental
renunciation is required in all cases.  The question is, is physical
renunciation essential too or just "a good idea."

I'd never heard of Raman before I joined the list so I don't particularly
care to include him in the Advaita camp or to throw him out.  But since
you mention some passages from him, let's see how well they conform to
Advaita siddhantas.

This is not actually in conflict with Vedantic teachings.  The shloka
Sadananda quoted from Bhagavadgita says the same thing.  Sannyasis do
interact with society so they have certain symbols which indicate to
society that they are sannyasis.  But they are not part of the sannyasa
itself.  Shankaracharya has written a stotra called kaupinyapanchaka which
extols the paramahansa who wears nothing but a loincloth and bhasma and
meditates on omkara as the ideal sannyasi.

If a person  claims to have renounced individuality and maintains worldly
posessions and life, then he is either a charlatan or a liar.  To say "it
is the body doing it not the self"  is just being irresponsible.  the body
doesn't drive a car by itself, or keep a job or post to the Internet.  All
it is capable of by instinct is a few basic drives such as sleep, hunger
etc.  Everything else requires mental effort and a sense of doership.

The notion of duty is incompatible with the notion of renunciation.

For the mind to turn inward isn't enough.  It does that in dreams too.
But we do not consider dreams to be some exalted state but rather the
ultimate illusion.

Sorry but this notion of destiny is baloney.  All that prarabdha is, is
the effects of your prior actions.  Those actions required free will and a
sense of doership.  Similiarly it is ones actions today which determine
the "destiny" of tomorrow.  Renunciation means the renunciation of
prarabdha karma as much as any other kind.

Perhaps or perhaps not.  It seems to me the informed members do not see
major differences between Ramanas thoughts and Shankaracharyas.  But they
have come out for the idea of renunciation being physical and mental and
for the idea of free will (see the archives.)  So it is not clear they
would agree with the views of Raman you have posted here.   In any case it
is the teachings of Shankaracharya which provide the yardstick for howm
much credence to give to whom on this list.
