 I do not understand how it seems so simple to you and to F. Maiello to
switch from the vyavahaarika to the paaramaartika so easily. I can easily
delude myself that I am. Period. End of story.
 It would still be a dulision and if I begin trusting my instincts, I will
do what the accumulated vaasanaas want me to. (and need I even say what
they will drag me into?)

 It has to be understood that far being certain, apart from Upanishadic
statements, and perhaps in a few cases, instances of yogic samadhi, there
is no justification in making blanket statements about the One-ness.

 The only thing certain to me right now is I am Vaidya. I have this and
that etc etc. If you have realised the One-ness, I am only a figment of
your imagination. But just because you say I am a image in your dream
world, I dont just vanish; atleast I know I dont just vaporize into thin
air ! And you dont vanish for me either.

 Kindly address issues at the vyaavahaarika level.

Cheers,
Vaidya.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The place, time, objects and their knower etc., projected in a dream
during sleep are all mithyA (an illusion/false). So too, here. in the
waking state, the world that is seen is a projection by one's own
ignorance. Likewise, this body, the senses, the breath, the ego etc.,
are all unreal. Therefore, That thou art, the peaceful, defectless,
supreme, non-dual Brahman.  -- Adi Shankara in VivekacUdAmani.
