Your point is right. But somehow (may not be in this thread, but in other
concurrent threads), actionlessness was attributed to physical sannyAsa,
which I think is not correct. If you agree that actionlessness is there
only for jnAnam in embodied form, yes that is the highest state.

I have some doubts about your point ".. Nobody is born a jivanmukta
without first having been a mumukshu..", but that will be the subject of
another thread.
