But since there is really only one "place," ever, then there's no other
place to go!

Some more than others.  But even with different labels, how can the moon
that they point to be more than one?  It can't.  If it is insisted that
only one philosophy can take you "there" (and the one would be advaita
vedanta as taught by Adi Shakara) then this is tantamount to saying that
liberation/enlightenment/jnana has happened only to formal advaita vedantins.
