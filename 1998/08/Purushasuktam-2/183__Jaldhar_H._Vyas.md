Well given that none of us have time machines I don't know if your
question can be answered but Purushasukta and Uttaranarayana sukta
together make up the 31st adhyaya of Vajasaneyi Samhita of
Shuklayajurveda.  Purusha Sukta is part of Rgveda too.

Some Indologists think they are from a particularly later time in the
formation of the Vedic corpus but not for any goodreasons as far as I can
tell.
