On Ganapati Atharva Sheersha Upanishad:


1) Some of the swara differences

"namaste ganapataye", in some versions the ga is anudatta, whereas in
others it stays swarita

"Ava twam maam", in some versions Ava starts anudatta, in others the Va
is swarita, and tha av is therefore udatta

"twam pratyaksham brahmaasi" the khsam is anudatta in some versions, and
swarita in others (which alters the swara marking for Brahma)

2) Some differences in reading

Some versions begin "lam namaste Ganapataye"

The order of "Ava purastaat..etc" is different in some versions

in the sections "twam gunatrayaateetaha" some versions add the line
"twam avasthhatrayaateetaha"

the Ganesha Gayatrai is variously read "tanno dantihi" , and tanno
"dantee"

The sections "ekadantam chaturhastam" the order of these verses varies
in different versions.

>From "etat atharvashiram yo'dheete" onwards is the stuti as opposed to
the actual Upanishad.

Given that this is an advaita page, those of you who recite this
Upanishad as part of you reflections may already have noticed that it
pays homage to other Upanishads, mantras and darshanas .  Below is a
quick reference guide.  As you recite this Upanishad, you will find
making these connections a powerful tool to unify the teaching in this
great Upanishad:

"twameva pratyaksham TATTWAMASI" (Chandogya Upanishad)

"twameva SARVAM KHALWIDAM BRAMHAAasi" (Upanishad)

"Rtam Vachmi..."  reference to "Rtam vadishyami..." the Shanti mantra of
Taittiriya Upanishad Shiksha Valli

"Twam anandamayastwam brahma mayaha" and "twam gyaanamayo
vigyaanamayo'si" reference to the Pancha Kosha teaching in Taittiriya
Upanishad

"Sarvam jagadidam twatto jayate ..etc" is an implied answer to the
section in Bhrgu Valli "Yato va imani bhutani jaayante"

"Twam chatvari vak parimitaa padani" is a direct quote from the Rig Veda
verse
"Chatvari vak parimitaa padani, taani vidur braamhana ye maneeshinaha
Guhaa treeni nihitaa ne'ngayanti, turyiam vacho manushyaa vadanti"
There are four levels of speech according to the wise. Three remain
hidden from us-we speak in only the fourth (superficial) level

"Twam muladhara sthhito'si nityam" is a reference to muladhara chakra at
the base of the spine as per the Yoga tradition

"Prakrtehe purushaat param" referencing how Ganapati transcends the
Sankhya concepts of Prakrti and Purusha.

It is important to put in context these differences in reading. When I
am asked "why are there different versions?" my response is that this is
the wrong question.  Given the vast expanse of time that separates us
from the original, and the human trait of Chinese whispers, it is
astonishing that the variances in readings across the Veda are so
minimal. It always blows me away when I meet someone for the first time
from thousands of miles away, and we can sit and recite in an IDENTICAL
fashion down to the last swara a random portion of the Veda

Regards

Subhanu
