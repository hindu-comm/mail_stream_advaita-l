 A group of us are conducting a sahasra modaka gaNapati homa and
 pUjA at the Hindu Samaj Temple in Wappingers Falls, NY. Everyone is
 invited. The sahasra modaka gaNapati homa is done with the chanting
 of the GaNapati-atharva-shiirshha-upanishhad. At the end of each
 of the first ten mantras of the upanishhad, a modaka is offered
 as oblation. If the number of performers is ten, then a hundred
 modakas will have been offered at the end of each recitation of the
 upanishhad. A total of ten such recitations will require that one
 thousand modakas be offered.
