Everday during sandhya we say before prANAyAmam that R^iShi for
praNava is brahma, Chandas is gAyatrI and devata is paramAtma. I
think that is very good reminder about the greatness of praNava,
as its devata is paramAtma.

I would like someone to shed light on how the Chandas is defined
for syllable AUM as gAyatrI.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Ravi
