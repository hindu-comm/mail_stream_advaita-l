I am posting the commentary of shrI lalita trishati bhAshyam by
shrI shankara. This list is for discussing advaita-vedanta as
taught by shrI shankara. Discussing shrI shankara's work is
perfectly valid and with in the scope of the list. As such
articles related and promoting bhakti withing the framework of
advaita is acceptable.

shankara bhAshyams on shrI viShnu sahasranAmam and lalitAtrishati
explain many subtle aspects of advaita-vedanta.  I would request
you to think twice before making a post like this.


Here is the guidelines which I send to all new users. If anyone
disagrees with the list items, they are requested to write to me
in private. Do not discuss this on the list.

LIST POLICIES

1) Advaita-L is a open, unmoderated list to discuss advaita-vedanta as
taught by shrI shankara. By advaita-vedanta, the tradition established
by shrI shankara and the maThas created to is referred.

2) Even though the major emphasis is on advaita-vedanta taught by shrI
shankara, topics related advaita-vedanta are welcome. Purpose of other
related articles should be to aid the understanding of advaita-vedanta.

3) Articles promoting bhakti within the framework of vedAnta are most
welcome.  The articles should be acceptable to the framework of
advaita-vedanta.  Even though advaita-vedanta holds that liberation
is through AtmajnAnam, bhakti is always emphasized.

4) Items 2 and 3 are vague, as the maintainer of the List, I reserve
the right on acceptability of articles. In the case the articles are
unacceptable, it will be informed in private and resolved in private.

5) Discussion of nAstika traditions and their philosophies are not
allowed. By nAstika traditions, I mean traditions like buddhism and
jainism. But scholarly articles comparing these traditions with
advaita-vedanta will be accepted. These articles should be sent to
the list manager (msr at tamu.edu) and not to the list.


6) Debates will be allowed. But it should be between two individuals
and not groups. And the individuals should choose a judge (who should
also be a list member) on mutual agreement and the debate should not
prolong more than a reasonable length of time, say one month. And the
loser should accept the position of the winner, atleast on the list.
The debates should be only on topics with in the fold of
advaita-vedanta. The debates between other different schools
(inter-tradition) will not be allowed.

7) Main purpose of this forum is to learn and understand
advaita-vedanta as taught by shrI shankara. I request members to aid
this goal.

8) Posters should not be disrespectful to towards saints and sages of
other traditions, and should show respect towards each other as well.

9) As the maintainer of this list, I reserve the final word on
critical issues like acceptablity of the articles and others
But I will not be autocratic, I will discuss the matter in private
with  knoweldgeable members of the list.  I will be open to
suggestions.
