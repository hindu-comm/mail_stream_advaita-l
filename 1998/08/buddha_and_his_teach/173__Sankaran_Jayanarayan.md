This is where the story begins, actually :-)

There are doubts as to whether or not the commentary attributed to
Shankara is authentic. The reason is obvious: when terms like "Buddha is
the greatest among all the bipeds" is liberally interpreted by the
commentator as an invocation to a Guru, and verses very evidently
composed by Buddhist commentators like Nagarjuna are lifted almost
verbatim, and the commentator doesn't notice the similarities to
Buddhism (note the fact that Shankara's Bramha suutra bhaashhya does
reveal knowledge of Buddhism), doubts on the authorship of the
commentary on the kaarikaa are legitimate. After reading both the BSB
and the commentary on the MANDuukya kaarikaa, it's obvious that the
latter reveals a great lack of knowledge of Buddhism. I could go into
the details in a much more clear-cut manner if only I had a copy of the
BSB with me now.

As to what exactly constitute the authentic works of Shankara are not
yet decided on this list.

If I remember one of the guidelines (#5) correctly: a discussion on the
commentaries comparing advaita with Buddhist doctrines is allowed. I
understand that they ought to be sent to the list manager, but your
posting has come directly to the list, and I am doing likewise for my
present posting.

I respect his position as list administrator and understand that he has
the last say. But there was a suggestion that he wouldn't be autocratic
in his rejection of postings.

This I didn't know :-) I have read of Kumarila Bhatta's views, but not
of Sureshvara's.

I hope you realize the absurdity of your above statement! You can
substitute "Buddha" with "Ramana" and it would still be logical :-) It's
like the muslim who said,"If a text is in accordance with the Koran,
burn the book -- it cannot be of any use. If not, you should burn it
because it goes against the Koran."

The reason for quoting Ramana or others is so that we can understand
some salient points of advaita better which Shankara may not have dwelt
upon.

I had to reply to his first email, since there was the point about
GauDapaada that required clarification. I didn't want to get into this
mess, and this shall certainly be my last posting on this topic.
