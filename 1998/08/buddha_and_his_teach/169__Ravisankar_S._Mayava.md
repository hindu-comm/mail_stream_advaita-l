I request the members not to shift the focus towards shrI buddha
and his teachings. If some one wants to make a scholarly post
comparing the teachings of buddha with advaita-vedanta with the
purpose of clarifying and explaining certain concepts in
advaita-vedanta, they are welcome to send it to me. I will post
it to the list based on its worth. If I cannot decide by myself,
I will consult with others and decide.

As such, discussion on nAstika philosophies like buddhism,
jainism, etc. is not permitted on this list. Please avoid it.

Thanks

Ravi
