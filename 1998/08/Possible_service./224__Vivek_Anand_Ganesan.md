Hello everyone,
   I am planning to go on a long trip to India. I would be glad to be
of service to members in this list during this trip. I was thinking of
bringing some not-so-easy-to-come-by books from India. I would be very
grateful for guidance from list members as to what books are hard to
obtain in US and where to get them in India.
  If you are interested in this, please let me know personally.

Thank you,

-Vivek.
