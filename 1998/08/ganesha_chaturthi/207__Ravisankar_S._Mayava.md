As ganesha chaturthi is approaching, may we meditate on Lord
ganesha. May HE create obstacles when we stray away from the
righteous path and may HE shatter all the obstacles that come in
the way of our spiritual enquiry.

Though he always sports the appearance of a child, he can crumble
the the mountains of obstacles. Though he is elephant--faced, he
is honored even by his five--faced father Shiva (sadyaojaatam,
vaamadevam, aghoram, tatpurushham and iishaanam). Lord Brahma,
Indra and the other Devas seek him to fulfil their aspirations.
He is known as Ganesha and he is endowed with boundless glory.
May he bless me with wealth!

(from shrI shankara's subrahmaNya bhujangam)

As tamizh poet auvai ( a great devotee of Lord ganesha) says in
the poem "vAkkuNDAm nalla manamuNDam: Those who worship Lord
ganesha will be blessed by sarasvatI (their wisdom will be
reflected in speech: vAkku uNDAm), blessed by mahAlakShmI ( Her
grace will fall upon them as She turns Her eyes towards them:
mAmalarAL nOkkuNDAm) and also a pure mind (nalla manamuNDAm).

May we all worship Lord ganesha, who is the Self of all, with
love and reverence.
