Nagy - just saw your note.  I am in between my travels right now.  I also
noted that others have adequately addressed the topic and there is not much
for me to add other than Krishna's statement in Ch. 6 in response to
Arjuna's question that it is indeed difficult to contrl the mind -
Krishna's answer is it is difficut but not impossible - by constant
practice and vairaagya one can control the mind - Abhyaasena tu kounteya
vairaagyeNa ca gRihyate| - so the role of vairaagya cannot be understated.

Hari Om!
