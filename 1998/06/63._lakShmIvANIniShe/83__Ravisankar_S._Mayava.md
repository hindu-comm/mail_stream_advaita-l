63. lakShmIvANIniShevitA

SHE who is served by lakShmI and vANI.

lakShmI is ramA signifying the power of wealth. vAnI is sarasvatI
signifying the power of knowledge. They are one with HER. SHE is served by
both with sincere devotion. Here, sevA means obeying all HER behests
expressed by HER mere glance.
