The point is this is not the kind of thing which can be known well from
books.  Imagine all you knew about Western civilization came from the
Bible, Shakespeare, and the works of Aristotle.  You might be quite
shocked if you were to observe the discrepancy between that and
the behavior of people on an average American street.  But that doesn't
mean that Western civilization doesn't exist or its' ideals are
non-existent.  The trouble when Indians discuss caste is that even the
supposedly "scientific" ones are overly focused on theory and pay little
attention to actual practice.

Even in Shankaracharyas time, a neat simple  fourfold division didn't
exist.  The smrtikaras do acknowledge the existence of jatis.
Interestingly enough they do see thme as being a "degeneration" of the 4
Varnas but again that's theory.  In practice they recognize them.
