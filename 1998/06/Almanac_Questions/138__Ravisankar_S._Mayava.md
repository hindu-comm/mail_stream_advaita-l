namaste

I got some valuable information in a great detail on these questions from
Govind (he forwarded the info posted on bhakti list *). I will go through
them, and post what I understand based on those posts. I have a panchangam
as well, which I started using recently on daily basis (while saying
saMkalpam). I will compare what is written in those posts with the almanac
and post it to the list.

Calendar based on Sun is called sauramAna and not sUryamana.

With respects,

Ravi

* bhakti list is a forum to discuss shrIvaishnava sampradayam. It is
maintained by shrI mani varadarajan. It is one of the best lists on the
internet (IMHO).

Archives of this list can be read from (it is not upto date) from
http://www.best.com/~mani/sv/bhakti/archives/ There you will find very
nice articles written by shrI Vidyasankar Sundaresan clarifying some
subtle aspects of advaita-vedanta
