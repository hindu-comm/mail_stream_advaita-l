 govindam paramAnandam sadgurum pranato'smyaham||

 I tender my obeisance to my sadguru, Govinda, the embodiment of supreme
bliss, who is beyond thought and sppech and who is the goal of all
VedAntic truths.

 It is to be noted here that Sri BhagavatpAda combines in this sloka his
obeisance both to his own guru, Sri GovindabhavatpAda and to the Supreme
God Sri Govinda Himself. He identifies his guru with the Supreme God.
