 By proper reasoning, the conviction about the reality of the rope is
gained. This puts an end to the great fear and misery caused by the
serpent which arose by delusion.

 It is well known that a man filled with fear due to his thinking that the
rope which he asw in the tilight was a serpent, gets rid of the fear and
the tremblimg when he understands the truth about the object by proper
examination by the light of the lamp. The serpent that arose in the rope
due to delusion, the grief (and fear) caused by such mis apprehension,
both these are destroyed by proper examination. That is called
rajjutattvAvadrtih, the conviction of the truth about the rope. In the
same way samyagvicAra is applied to the destruction of the grief of
repeated birth and death which is samsAra, produced by delusion. Such
samyagvicAra has for its effect the conviction about the truth of the
Atman which is the nature of the direct realisation of Brahman. Thus the
analogy of rope-serpent-delusion is fulfilled in every respect.

A few months back, I ran into a web-site

http://206.252.12.4/hindpilgrim/mokshpil.htm#Dwadash Jyotirlingam

which mentions the following as one of the dvAdasha jyotirlingANi :

<quote>

Sri Vaidyanath dham - Bihar, Joshidi rail station about
fifty miles from Patna.

This lingam is said to have been established by
the Lanka King Ravana himself. It is said that
Shiva agreed to go to Lanka on condition that
Ravana does not set the lingam down on ground.
However the gods conspired to stop him by asking
Varuna to go inside Ravan's bladder. Ravan
had to stop and releive himself by setting the
lingam on the ground. The local river is the proof of
that. However when Ravan tried to pick up the lingam,
it would not budge. As he pushed hard, he
managed to bend the lignam which is visible to this day.
There is also a mineral spring or Kunda
nearby. The place is also considered one of the seven dhams.

The precis of the above seems to be "Substance is more important than
form". The statement "Doing it with full attention and understanding the
mantra-s" seems to undermine the procedural details (though he may not
have intended that) One should be very careful with such statements so
that people don't misunderstand the idea. IMO, both "form" and
"substance" are equally important, if anything "form" is more important.

For eg, take the pa.chAyatana pUjA. In the shiva pa.nchAyatana pUjA
(where shiva is the ishhTa devata), the five are supposed to be kept in
the order

gaNesha            ambikA

          shiva

sUrya              vishhNu

            |
            V

      [shiva facing the east]

Question:

1. Is someone blindly following the rules without understanding the
mantra-s, and without proper concentration doing the pUjA better?

or

2. Is someone not following the above rule, but fully understanding the
mantra-s and with complete concentration doing the pUjA better?

[ NOTE: The above rule is just that: a rule. There is no questiopn of
"understanding" anything here. There are no "reasons" for the rule.]

Answer: smR^iti assures that #1 is better. It in fact assures us that
someone not following the above rule scrupulously will get exactly the
opposite effect, it declares that he'll experience great disaster (I'm
not exagerating).

Thus, in this case, "form" is more important than "substance". There are
many other rules as to the performance of the above pUjA. IMO, one just
needs to blindly follow it with faith. No need to understand any
mantra-s. It's good to understand the mantra-s of course, but it is
subsidiary to following procedural details with complete faith. Even
blindly following it leads to the same result, perhaps it will take a
while longer. I think one more janma would'nt matter in the grand scheme
of things :-).

Again, I am not saying that the pUjAri you quote intended to undermine
the procedural details (you could include this in "quality"), but his
statements could be easily misconstrued to mean that. In fact I have
heard many people say such things,as if only "concentration" and
"understanding" is of supreme importance, quoting examples like kaNNappa
nAyanAr!! One should have some idea of who to compare himself to!!!! I
wanted to ask one of these guys, "Will you pluck out your eye for
shiva?" :-). The next thing you know these guys will be throwing stones
at shiva li.ngam-s like sAkkiya nAyanAr :-) :-).

In an ideal world of course all priests would be perfect. I know you are
not criticizing them, but here is my $0.02 on this. The priests are just
doing what the majority of the people want. Once a priest came to our
house for doing yajur upakarma. He was a substitute for our usual
priest, since he was taken ill. The poor guy was from some village and
patiently did every homam we are supposed to and also explained
meanings. My relatives were complaining later, "Why the heck did the guy
take so long? Does he think everyone in the city has nothing else to do
like in a village?" Unfortunately, that is the pathetic state we have
sunk to. We have only ourselves to blame.

Another thing which really irritates me is people complaining about
priests asking for 5 or 10 Rupees more. IMO, if he asks for 10Rs he
should be given 100Rs. He is doing a great favor, isn't he? I consider
myself a non-viloent guy, if anything could provoke me to violence it's
probably people complaining non-stop about the "avariciousness" of
priests!

IMO, we should never complain about priests (I am not saying you are),
we don't have the right to.

Rama.

 You are quite right. Conquering the mind is essential. But this
 cannot be done (in general) immediately. One way is to purify the
 mind of all the dirty things by karma/bhakti. A purified mind is
 relatively easy to control. The other way is to relentlessly
 reinforce the notion of the illusoriness of the world as the
 Yoga vAsishhTha prescribes. Thereby the mind becomes subdued.

 In either case, there is some sAdhana required. I was only trying
 to point out that it is not possible to avoid sAdhana and reach
 jnAna by simply _assuming_ that bondage or liberation is just in
 the mind and therefore, merely thinking oneself as being liberated
 will actually guarantee liberation. From the pAramArthika view,
 there may be no liberation or bondage, but for a seeker this is not
 relevant. The seeker has to undergo some sAdhana to subdue the mind.
 This may be by bhakti , karma or the relentless inquiry suggested
 by Yoga vAsishhTha.
