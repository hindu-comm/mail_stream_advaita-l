AUM kamaNDalulasatkarAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara whose hand is adorned with kamaNDalam. kamaNDalam
is a small vessel (made from clay or wood. The tree from which it is made
is known as kamaNDalataru). SannyAsins carry water in this small vessel.
It can symbolically mean a simple and self contained life.
