AUM  bhasmoddhULitavigrahAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara whose body has the sacred marks of bhasmam or ash.
His body smeared with bhasmam shines like a vigraham.

The sacred ash not only indicates the ephemeral nature of the world (in a
symbolic way), but also protects the wearer from evil influences (being a
yaj~na prasadam). In shrI subrahmanya bhujangam, shrI shankara says that
the vibhuti prasadam of lord shanmukha will destroy many ills and evil
influences.
