AUM kAShAyavasanopetAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who is dressed in ochre robes. kAShAyam means ochre
colour and denotes the clothes in that colour. sannyAsin wear ochre
coloured clothes. This colour resembles fire and denotes that the
sannyAsin has burnt all his attachments in the fire of wisdom. shrI
shankara who renounced all the attachments at a very young age is the
greatest of the sannyAsins.
