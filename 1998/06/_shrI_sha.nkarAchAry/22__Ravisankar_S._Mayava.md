AUM brahmasUtropaniShadbhAShyAdigranthakalpakAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who wrote bhAShyam-s on brahmasUtra, upaniShad-s,
bhagavadgItA, and prakaraNa granthas like vivekachUDAmaNi explaining the
Ultimate.  I bow to Him again and again. Without these works it is
impossible to understand the Ultimate truth explained in veda-s and
upaniShad-s.
