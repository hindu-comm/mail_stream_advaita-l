AUM chaturdikchaturAmnAyapratiShTAtre namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who established four AmnAya maTham-s at  corners of
four directions in bharatam. These maTham-s are shr^ingeri (south), pUrI
(East), jyotirmaTh (north), and dvArakA (west).  These maTham-s in a sense
give the geographic extent of bhAratham, were the sanAtana dharma is
practised.
