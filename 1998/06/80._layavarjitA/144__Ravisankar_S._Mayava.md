80. layavarjitA

SHE who is devoid of dissolution. laya means destruction. SHE transcends
it. "avinAshi vAreyamAtama anuchChitti dharmA" - Atman is indestructible,
it cannot be cut. [bR^ihadAraNyakopaniShad]. Hence, SHE is indestructible.
In this context the term laya stands for ShaDbhAva vikAra. These six
changes are birth (jananam), existence (astitva), vR^iddhi (growth),
vipariNAma (change), apakShaya (decay) and nAsha (death or destruction).
smr^itis also indicate that SHE is beyond all these changes. SHE is satyam
j~nAnam anantam brahma as stated by taittirIyopaniShad.
