Yes it does.  But Rshi means mantra drshta or see-er of mantras.  Perhaps
the receiving of a mantra was an all-round sensory experience which is
only partially described by "seeing" or "hearing".  What it all boils down
to is that the Rshis are only the agents of transmission of the Vedas not
authors.  The Vedas have no authors human or for that matter divine.

Smriti is that which is based on the Vedas.  Unlike Shruti they are the
actual production of various Rshis.  In matters of Dharma they are as
valid and imperetive as Shruti.  Only in the case where a Smrti
contradicts a Shruti can it be ignored though the Shastris prefer to try
and reconcile them rather than throw them out.
