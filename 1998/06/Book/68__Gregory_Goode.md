More and more of an understatement all the time.  I've seen many of these
teachers in the U.S., and talked to many of their confused students and
devotees.  Some of what results is a pernicious new egocentric
superimposition, with the ego now attributing Absolute or Brahman-status to
itself, claiming that it doesn't do anything, but actually continuing to do
the same old egocentric things as before.  Hence the perverted statements
as above, "I am not doing that, it is only the body."

Is there somewhere I can get a copy of the Voice of Divinity?
