The Swamiji was a Bengali sannyasi who lived in Kashi during the time of
the Mughal emperor Akhbar.  Personally he was very devoted to Krishna
Bhagawan.  His major works are Advaitasiddhi and Advaitaratnarakshana
(against Dvaita), Gudharthadipika (commentary on Bhagavadgita),
Siddhantabindu (on Dasashloki of Shankaracharya), He also wrote a tika on
Shivamahimnastotram and other works.  As well as his scholarly activities
he was a great leader using his influence in the court to defend Tirths
and yatris against Muslim attack.I think there is more information on the
Advaita website now maintained by Ramakrishnan.

Sir, with respect may I say that the graet master Sankara has explained
very vividly in the Atmabodha and the Vivekachoodamani about the caste
system as well as worship by women.

One is not a Brahmin or a Shudra merely by being *born* into such a
family. So a person cannot be precluded on grounds of being born as a
Shudra.

As for women chanting the mantra, Sankara talks of masculine tendencies
and traits being present in some women like the Rani of Jhansi, for
example. Does a great woman like her get prcluded???

Wonder if I have been able to get my thoughts through properly. Am no
authority on the subject....just a seeker.

Regards,  kamal
