 I incessantly adore in my heart Sri DakshinAmurti, the ocean of mercy,
who destroys the deepest darkness of avidya, and who, to salvage men
caught up in the ocean of samSara, descended down to earth in the form of
Sri Sivanrsimha Guru.
 O! Goddess of Speech! The embodiment of wisdom who was worshipped by Sri
BhagavatpAda, be pleased to explain the VivekachUdAmani through my lips.
 SArada! May the import of the clear and majestic words of the best
teachers (sri Sankara) shine in my mind through your grace.
 O! ratnagarbha Ganesha! the dispeller of all obstacles! Thou mine of
mercy! enable me to complete this task without any hindrace.
 O! ChandramaulIsvara! who shines by the effulgence of BrahmavidyA and who
displays the cinmudra! pray, endow me quickly with the realisation (of the
Supreme Truth)
