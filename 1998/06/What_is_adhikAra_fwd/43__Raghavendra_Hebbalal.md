Namaste,
        I have the following idea about the Vedas. Is it valid ?
The Vedas are eternal. But they are known only when a rishi actually realizes
it. This is similar to the laws of physics( for example). The Universal law of
gravitation had always existed and continues to exist. But it was DISCOVERED
by Newton. So through Newton, we came to know that law.

Is the analogy correct?

Thank you,
Raghavendra.
