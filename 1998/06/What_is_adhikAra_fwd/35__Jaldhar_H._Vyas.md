Given our lack of time machines how can anyone hope to answer this
question?

But why assume that?  Smriti is only secondary if it contradicts Shruti.

But it says Brahmans "came" from His mouth, Kshatriyas were "made" from
His arms.  Given this is a poem isn't more plausible to assume the words
are being used as synonyms for birth.  From the poetic point of view it
isn't too good to keep repeating the same word.

It doesn't say "sit at the face" it says "came from the mouth"  (Atleast
in the Shukla Yajurveda.)

sufficent is birth in a Brahman family.  To be a "good" Brahman requires
Upanayana, vedic study and practice of shatkarmas.

Why?

As a scientist I'm sure you're awary of biasing an experiment.  If you ask
a loaded question, can you hope to get an objective answer?

Did you see the quote from the Brahmasutra and Bhashya I posted.  less
relation I can agree with.  No relation I can't.

It isn't acceptable.

I may be sounding like a broken record here but why?
