    The current caste system includes  social ills like untouchability.
Are you trying to say that these things existed even in the time of the
Buddha?  These ills are  considered by sociologists to be a spin-off  of
the desire for political power and  dominance of the "upper" caste, rather
than as something which has been practiced from day one.  Besides, the
practice of the sanAtana dharma has not even the remotest connections to
exploitation of one group of people by another. In other words the part of
orthopraxy that has direct bearing to a regions body politik has to arise
with changes in the political system and cannot be independent of it.
Therefore it can be discarded without any loss of "dharmic" activity.   On
the other hand issues like vedadhikAra, brahmanatva, etc., seem to have
nothing whatsoever to do with the politics of an era, and it is reasonable
to assume that they are an important part of dharma and have been so since
quite a long time.

    If you think of the caste system as some kind of an artificial tool,
one has to realise that the 'triumph' has come with  its own cost--the
confusion that is it really a tool or does it imply some genuine
preconditions on the attainment of jnana?
