_have_ a great oral tradition.

So why quote from textbooks?

You may choose to know very little but others (including the acharya whose
book you read) know a lot more and those who know do not make disparaging
remarks nor repeat them blindly.

If such questions remain unanswered then why bring up what in the end is
idle gossip and speculation?

But who is to say the Atharvaveda contains "unethical" or "primitive"
beliefs.  This whole business started with 19th century Western scholars
whose puritanical upbringing and preconceived notions of what the Vedas
were supposed to be about.  Later their idiot Indian followers started
repeating the same things.  Vedanta (and we are discussing this on a
Vedanta list remember) says and never has said any such thing.

Then again, why bring it up?

My wifes maiden name was Dave which is a prakritization of Dwivedi which
means one of her ancestors learnt two vedas.  Given the amount of time and
effort it takes to learn even one shakha to learn 4, 3, or even 2 was a
noteable enough feat for people to take it as their family names.  It
doesn't mean they thought all the ones they didn't learn had something
wrong with them.

Advaita Vedanta is not just whatever may strike ones fancy, it is a body
of thought, with a history, doctrines, and postions for or against certain
things.  Either a proposition will fall within the bounds of Advaita or
(as in your case) it won't.  As Ravi has made clear this list is for
topics which fall within the bounds.

It's funny how people always discover the futility of intellectual debate
around the time they start losing one. ;-)
