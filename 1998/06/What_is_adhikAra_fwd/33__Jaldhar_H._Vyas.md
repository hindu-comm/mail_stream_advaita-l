I don't know if I have all the old messages but I only see the term
Mokshadhikara used once.  I agree it is a misnomer.  However the question
that was pose is what kind of person can achieve Moksha and this is not as
clear cut as it may seem even if we leave out the question of Adhikar.
Just as we all have the Adhikar to become millionaires but only the ones
who turn off the TV and get off the couch will have an actual chance.
Does ones caste have an effect on your chances for Moksha?  Prof. Grimes
for reasons known only to him thought not but this goes against the
evidence.

But we may ask, if parentage was not important, why did Satyakama bring it
up?

If we are going to presume that, why not also presume Satyakama was asked
other questions or his teacher observed other things?  After all when
arthavada occurs in the Vedas it is only to further a particular point
(i.e praise of truth in this case.)  It doesn't necessarily have to
provide the whole story.

You are right.  There is no one here who can claim never to have lied.
However part of the Brahman worldview is the ideal of never telling lies.
Despite reality falling short of the ideal, that we feel an obligation to
be truthful (bluntness on my part is because I value truth over peoples
feelings) gives us the right to presume.  This applies to other situations
too.  For instance, despite only one person on this list meeting the
minimum qualifications for Vedantic sadhana, we presume to talk about
Moksha etc.

I don't think so.  It's pretty clear from the Brahmasutra text that it is
the Vedantic texts which are being discussed.  If it was a matter already
covered by the Purva Mimamsa, the Brahmasutras would suffer from the fault
of redundancy.  The disagreement between Maharshi Jaimini and Maharshi
Badarayana is on the adhikara of the Devas.  They are in agreement on the
subject of Shudras.

Yes, but Adhikara is only partially the point.

As Anand pointed out, the purvakrt samskaras refer to previous lives so
their is no contradiction in the rules.

Nevertheless the sutras clearly state that Brahman is known
_from_the_vedas_.  Thus Vedadhikar does become relevant to Moksha albeit
indirectly.

And this is the crux of the matter.  Some people for various reasons are
uncomfortable with the idea that Vedanta is not universal in the way they
think it ought to be.  My question is why?  And can we justify rewriting
history because it doesn't suit our tastes?

Again this "unproductive arrogance" is something that exists and has
existed for a long long time.  The evidence is tremendous.  What is
special about today that it should change?

The confusion between Dharma and Moksha is hardly a new one.  After all
isn't an important part of the Mahabharata called Mokshadharma?  In fact
this is one of the central problems of Vedanta and a main reason for the
split between different schools.  Advaita Vedanta makes it clear that the
two are not synonyms but as we have seen there is overlap even here.

It may not need to be realistic but to be deserving of any kind of
intellectual respect, it needs to be consistent.  And for a philosophy
that claims to serve Truth and the destruction of illusion to be used
as an agent of obfuscation, well the word blasphemy is not to strong.
This whole topic arose when an alleged scholar called the idea that caste
has relevance to Vedanta "unvedantic."  This is blatantly untrue.  What I
have hoped to show, is a more accurate picture.
