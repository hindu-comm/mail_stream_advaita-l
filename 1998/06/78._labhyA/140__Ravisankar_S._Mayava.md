78. labhyA

SHE who is accessible to all devotees.

labhya means accessible. SHE is accessible to even those who are in
samsAra. SHE is masked by the limiting power of ignorance, yet SHE can be
realized in HER reflection in the infinite plane of knowledge which is the
inner instrument perfected by shravaNa etc. brahman is eternal and ever
present. Yet like the necklace on our neck which we has forgotten and
think it is lost, we think SHE is not accessible. But once one realizes
that the necklace was on the neck,  then it is known that it was there all
the time and was not lost.  While SHE is apparently lost to us, SHE is
ever with us and accessible.
