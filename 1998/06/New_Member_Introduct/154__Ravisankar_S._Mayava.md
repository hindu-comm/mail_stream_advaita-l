Subject: Introduction

Essentially, my interest is based on personal experience of
meditation, for which I do not have any kind of philisophical
context. As such, I am wondering whether or not the subject matter
of this list will provide what I am looking for. I was drawn
particularly to this list because of reading I have undertaken in the
past on Vedanta - this was some years ago, but I used to use a fair
amount of study time in a college library reading such books when I
should have been pursuing my studies!

Some fairly ephemeral reasons for wishing to subscribe to your list,
but I hope you will be tolerant enough to allow me to learn from
this useful resource.

Thank you.
