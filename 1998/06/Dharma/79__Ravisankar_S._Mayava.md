I agree with you. Wherever one goes there will be some problems and there
will be some new opportunites. As you pointed out one should try to do the
best with one's available resources. If I do not make an attempt to follow
dharma now, I will never do it.  Best course is seek guidance from God
and  do one's level best. It is HER grace which will make us adhere to
dharma.  I also agree with you that every age has its own problems. There
is no point in resorting to lethargy saying that was a golden age and I am
living in a damned kali yuga.
