On the other hand, there are problems in India we don't have to face.  The
political situation for one.  And for instance I hear that in Rajkot
summer has begun and with it drought. Such a simple thing as daily snana
will become difficult for many people.  So you should look at it that
there are problems everywhere and opportunities everywhere.

Maybe you threw away chances in the past but today is a new day.  "desh"
is maya and so is "kala".  You're in Texas right?  I know of a couple of
learned Gujarati Pandits in Texas so I'm sure there are South Indian ones
too.  Make use of them, they would probably be happy to help..
