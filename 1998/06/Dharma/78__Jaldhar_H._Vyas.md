Not true.  There have been upheavals and crises of confidence in the past
too.  Big ones.

One there never was a "golden age" that's not historically accurate.
Every age has had its own troubles.  And human beings have always been a
mix of good and bad.  I doubt very much if people were better in the "good
old days."

The hypocrisy of the older generation is undoubtedly the biggest problem
facing Hindu society in America.  It's what turns off many otherwise
interested people my age from Dharmic activities.  But another problem is
the parents often tell them what they think they want to hear instead of
the truth.  So we have all these "scientific" explanations which are often
complete rubbish.  Any attempt to water down our teachings no matter how
well intentioned is bad and doomed to failure.

Why assume it is a problem?  The immigrant generation may feel some
discomfort living in america but their children by and large do not.

One thing that definitely needs to be done (and which I hope to make my
contribution) is to increase and systemize the level of education.  I mean
no disrespect to the men and women who volunteer to teach classes etc.
but one hour or so every Sunday is simply not good enough.  It is possible
to get a good knowledge of Sanskrit here.  I know, I've done it but
it was needlessly hard.  We need pathashalas where Brahman boys can learn
shastras on just as high a level as they do in Bharat.
