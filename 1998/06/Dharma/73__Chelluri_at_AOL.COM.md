Dear Ravi

No need to put oneself down as brahmana for not able to do nityakarmas.  Do
what you have to do.  Everything is dictated by her- you just have to accept
and realize for the things she has given to you.  Like sri chinmaya said what
you do is your gift to her. Time is the essence here.  I will write more to
your personal address at the right time.  Keep posting her divya namas.
Blessings.

                                                                   Nagy
