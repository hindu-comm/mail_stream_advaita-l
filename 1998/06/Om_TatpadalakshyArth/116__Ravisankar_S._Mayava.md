namaskAram

This name is one of the names in shrI lalitAsahsranAmam. It is the 363
nAmam of shrImAtA. Through the name "tatpadalakShyArthA" sahasranAmam
worships HER as nirguNa brahman. The term "tat" by itself (in tattvamasi)
means the conditioned brahman or saguNa brahman. But through the function
of speech called lakShaNa it denotes the nirguNa brahman.  The name
literally means, "the meaning of the term tat through lakShana" . Hence
SHE is celebrated here as the nirguNa brahman.

Please refer to the names lakShyArthA and lakShanAgamyA of the trishatI
which I posted recently.
