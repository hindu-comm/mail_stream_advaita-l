I believe Sri Chandrasekara Bharati, former pontiff of Sringeri madam
once lapsed in samadhi during the archana of Sri Sarada at Sringeri. The
nama he stopped at was Om TatpadalakshyArthAyai namah. After coming out
of it, he reported exclaimed: advaitam stayam. advaitam satyam.
 Can any knowledgable member write the meaning of this particular nAma of
Sri Sarada.

Thanks.

Vaidya.
