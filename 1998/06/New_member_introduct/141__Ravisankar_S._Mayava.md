Subject: No postings on Advaita

Dear Mr. Ravi, M. :

There has been no postings on advaita ever since I
joined this mailing list. Has there been no discussion or
has my address been inadvertently left out ?

You had asked for a brief introduction about myself and
my interest in Advaita. My home page may give info. about
me.

The turning point in my life was the reading of 'Deivathin Kural'
vol - 1, as a student, way back in 1980. Ever since, I'm
covering all the lectures of H.H. Maha Periyaval and as a
consequence reading all works on Advaita - Pre-shankara,
Shankara's and Post-Shankara works.

I'm a frequent visitor to Shri. Vidya Shankar's now famous
home page on advaita, where I picked up your address for this
discussion group.

Both of you are doing a wonderful job and it merits more
compliments as you are doing this being research students.

May the Grace of H.H. be on both of you.

With regards,
