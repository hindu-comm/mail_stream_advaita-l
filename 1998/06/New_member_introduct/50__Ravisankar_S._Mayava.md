Knowing the principles behind the rituals will help one to do it
more effectively.  Take for instance Achamanam, when one understands
why we do it, its power increases (atleast I imagine so) dramatically.
When we waste so much time and effort to understand many meaningless
things (like news), I think one should strive hard to understand the
meaning behind the rituals.
