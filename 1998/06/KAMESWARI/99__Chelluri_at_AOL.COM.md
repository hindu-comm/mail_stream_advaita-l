Namaste.

A few comments on Shri Ram Chandran's two articles on Dharma: The personal
experiences (from his family's viewpoint) which he quoted are typical of
what most South Indian Brahmin families went through during the last four
or five generations. The way of life has changed, certainly, and the rate
of change (of the way of life) may have been more rapid during the last
fifty or sixty years. But, if we had asked our fathers for their views at
a similar stage in their life, I would assume they would have given a
similar response. The very fact that we are expressing such views is a
testament that the inherent values which we have, have not changed. Thus,
I do not see a need for alarm.

Dharma does not change with time. Still, a grihastha's dharma is to
provide provisions to the family. And it is to be done with the purity of
heart. The peace or turmoil which we see, is only a creation of the mind.
Thus, while most people see unrest and killings and technology-induced
unhappiness and insecurity around, a learned person sees himself to be
quite peaceful by the same events and in harmony with the surroundings.
That would not change with time.

Shri Ram Chandran made a forceful plea for providing the necessary
guidance to children and exhorted knowledgeable people to come forward
as volunteers at temples and other religious institutions.

I do not think anyone can disagree with that. However, I want to caution
about some pitfalls in that approach. Volunteerism is great as long as the
volunteer does not identify too closely with the cause.

We have seen many volunteers too passionately involved with what they are
doing, so much so that the individual volunteer and the cause in which
he/she is working cannot be separated. Usually this leads to a deep
involvement by the "volunteer" into the cause, so that he/she is no longer
a volunteer. That sort of attachment to the cause is sometimes worse
(for the individual) than not being involved. He/she may be doing some
"good" work but at the same time developing vAsanAs and attachments all
over.

Only a mahAjnAni like Shri Shankara can be a philosopher and religious
crusader with a zeal for uplift of masses and at the same time be
unattached to what He is doing. Ordinary humans of the present day
society cannot be the two aspects simultaneously (being an unattached
vairAgi and at the same time a person who voluntarily gets involved
in projects for what he/she thinks is good for the society).

Further, and this is my biggest concern about volunteerism, volunteers
of today are the politicians of tomorrow, or put another way, we have
seen politicians of today are all volunteers of yesterday. That speaks
volumes against volunteerism.

While I laud Shri Ram Chandran's plea for knowledgeable people to get
involved in the society and work for its spiritual uplift, only people
with superior outlook can be good at it, without compromising their
own ideals.
