Well, what I'm trying to say is that the Brahmana worldview would like
your first statement to be true.  Of course reality, fell short of the
mark but the self image was that a Brahmana always spoke the truth.  And
the story of Satyakama should be read that way.

Thanks for bringing this up.  I am pretty sure that in the Mahabharat
there is a statement that King Yudhishthir was the only man who never told
a lie.  But this is said of King Harishchandra too.

I agree.

Perhaps obligation is the wrong word.  What I meant to describe is the
feeling that though saying truth may be the duty of all, "low" people
cannot be expected to follow such lofty notions while the "high" ought to
do so and are to be criticized more when they don't.  And you're right it
is a perception.  What I'm arguing is that it is this kind of perception
which has influenced the authors of the shastras.
