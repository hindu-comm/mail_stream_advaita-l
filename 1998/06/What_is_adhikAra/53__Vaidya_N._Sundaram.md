Please pardon me for addressing only one of the points of the whole
argument.

 Are we trying to establish here that;
 If a Brahmana Then speak the Truth "ALWAYS"
 If speak Truth "ALWAYS" then a Brahmana
 If ever lied, never a Brahmana.

 I am not so comfortable with this line of reasoning. Again, quoting an
example: why does Vishwamitra make Harishchandra go through all those
miserable events? It all started with Indra asking Vasista in his court (i.e
Indra's court): Is there one who has always spoken the truth?  Vasista's
reply was, Yes. Harishchandra is one such, and he has not even thought of
lying even when his mother's womb, and Vishwamitra tries to prove Vasista
wrong, as he is so fond of doing.

 The point I am trying to make is, Harishchandra says in the end that if he
has been a true "Kshatriya" etc etc ... thereby denoting that he has spoken
the truth always, is aware that he has spoken nothing but the truth always
and is also aware that he is a kshatriya. And I believe it is also a very
well recognised fact that to have one who has "never" lied is a "Rare" event
with very low probability. So, being a Brahmana, has nothing to do with
saying the Truth "always". Truth is what should be said, irrespective of the
status / stature of the person. The qualification or disqualification from
being a Brahmana does not arise because of Truth of the lack of it.

 Where is the "obligation"?. Truth is Truth, irrespective of perceptions.  It
is better called "duty" (to say the Truth). And "to presume" comes not from
feeling an "obligation to the Truth", rather an feeling of "Knowing better"
and hence "inform the other of his/her mistake"

Cheers,
Vaidya.

Greetings Nanda:

We the human beings possess something unique and consequently we can't
explain all our experiences to anyone.  What "I" experience is Unique
and Eternal.  On the other hand, my perception through my mind undergoes
changes due to time and environment.  Shruti represents the experience
of "I" and Smritis correspond to mind perceptions of different human
beings at different points of time.  This may explain why Smritis such
as Gita, Brahma Sutras and others needed commentaries.  Shruti is the
Absolute Truth and Smritis represent the Relative Truth.  If Shruti is
Gold, then gold necklaces, bangles and rings could be the Smritis.  If
we represent Ganges at the Gangothri as Shruti, then the Ganges at
Allahabad and Banaras will become Smritis.   In summary, Smritis don't
exit without Shruti and we have no means to question the existence of
Shruti.   We can also understand the distinction between Shruti and
Smritis using the distinction between "theorem" and "example problems."
The example problems are useful to understand the fundamental concepts
and theorems.  However, any example is neither NECESSARY nor a proof for
the TRUTH of the theorem.   Finally, we need to understand that both the
theorems and the examples are important for our learning and
understanding.   Now it may become clear why Adi Sankara said that
"Shruti is indispensable to the Sadhana!" Adi Sankara is a  Missionary
and a great Visionary.   Intellectual integrity and honesty though
essentials are not sufficient to question the Truth of Vedas or the
Vision of Sankara.

Note: I agree that what is not present in Mahabharat is not present any
where.  No one has the time and energy to search and find what it
contains? In this computer, era, generating the past, the present and
future discoveries using random generators of letters, numbers and
symbols is quite feasible. The computer generated volumes of work will
also contain mountains of useless garbage!  Truth is an inner experience
and none in the past, presents or future can generate the TRUTH!
