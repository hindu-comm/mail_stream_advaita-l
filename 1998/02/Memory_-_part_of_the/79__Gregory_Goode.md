This is pretty much what I do mean.  And by the same token, since
memory is just one thought that seem to refer to some other thing
which itself is a thought, memopry doesn't prove the existence of any
other time either.  But there is a good point to saying there is no
NOW either.  As soon as you are pointing to somthing and saying THIS
IS NOW, that object (what you are pointing to) is automatically in the
past.  So the Now, like the Truth, cannot be objectified.  It just IS.
