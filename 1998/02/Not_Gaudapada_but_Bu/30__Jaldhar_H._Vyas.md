This line of thinking is an old one.  Buddha is considered one of the
avatars of Vishnu Bhagavan.  So the story goes, the Asuras had overpowered
the Devas by becoming even more Dharmic then they were.  So in the form of
the Buddha Vishnu Bhagavan taught them heresy.  Unfortunately, this heresy
accidently leaked out into the world of men where it was misinterpreted.

Nowadays there are people who with an odd desire to bring Hinduism and
Buddhism together who make the same argument but this is not exactly
flattering to Buddhists is it?

If they suspected that his work showed Buddhist influence and they were
that keen to suppress it, why didn't they just let it die along with the
rest of Indian Buddhism?

Vidyashankar has already answered this well.  You are attempting to inject
modern notions into a completely different situation.
