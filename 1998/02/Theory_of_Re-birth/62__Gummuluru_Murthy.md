Greg made some nice points on this and the earlier thread "getting out of
deep sleep - theory of rebirth".

1. Yes, from the Brahman-unqualified-by-anything approach (I call it
   paramArtha), the only thing there is is the same unchanging Brahman.
   There is no need of any proof nor there is any doubt of continuity.
   Continuity does not have a meaning because the time is frozen.
   Everything is still and attributeless.

2. However, I like to qualify the above with the following. While realized
   and still being embodied (jeevanmukta state Shri RamaNa, the sages of
   the upanishhads), there still exists deep sleep, and death, and time,
   which jeevanmukta sees to be unreal, just like the body of the
   jeevanmukta. What I mean to say is, jeevanmukta still sees the body
   going through the various stages (deep sleep, death etc) but considers
   them to be unreal and not part of the Brahman which he/she is). This
   particular viewpoint is supported by Shri RamaNa's quote given by Greg
   earlier "death and sleep are the same, but the sleep is short and the
   death is long". My conclusion to my question is: the question belongs
   in the realm of the Brahman-qualified-by-mAyA domain and that question
   would not arise in the paramArthah domain (no question arises in the
   paramArthah domain). Further, the answer given by Shri RamaNa to that
   question is the closest one can put it to the paramArtha understanding
   (and still dealing with the duality of a questioner and the answer).
   I wonder if Greg can give me the exact reference to Shri RamaNa's
   statement, in what context it was made and where it appeared. I am
   curious why death is considered long and sleep is considered short.

Points 1 and 2 above are not considered to be different but simply stating
the same in an expanded way. One thing that follows (2) above is: the
question often arises in the Brahman-qualified-by-mAyA realm: at the
paramArthah level of understanding, is there deep sleep, death, body,
jagat ? The answer as I see it is: there is still the deep sleep, death,
body, time and the jagat but they are recognized to be unreal. The entity
that is jeevanmukta sees them apart from the Self.
