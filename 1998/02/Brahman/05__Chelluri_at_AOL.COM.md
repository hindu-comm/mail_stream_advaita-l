                                             Brahmaiva Satyam

Could somebody help me with the meaning of the letters in "Brahman"
What is "Brah" and what is "man" means.

I am trying to find out from Bijaakshara Nighantuvu.  In the meantime could
somebody post the meaning whatever source they have on hand.

Thanks                                                           Nagy

By the way Nagy means the abharana of Siva
