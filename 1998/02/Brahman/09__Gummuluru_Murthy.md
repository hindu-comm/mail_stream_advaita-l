Namaste. The comment is well taken. Is Brahman describable ? If so, how,
except in neti, neti form ? I agree with the latter part of the comment
that Brahman is certainly not a void. I would also seek clarification
on what Charles wrote, quoting Shri Shankara that Brahman is a well-known
                                                               ^^^^^^^^^^
entity. I see it at the other extreme - very hard to comprehend -
guhAdguhyam - most secretive.
