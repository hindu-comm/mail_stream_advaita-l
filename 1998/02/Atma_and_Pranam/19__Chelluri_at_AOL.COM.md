                                               Brahmaiva Satyam


Atma (soul) and Pranam (life).  Are these two words synonymous.  Could
somebody comment?

I read in one of the books from Ramanashram, RM says that the soul enters the
fetus during the 6th month.   This statement implies life preceeds soul.  I am
begining to think these two words are different.  Soul is eternal and life is
miniscule

                                                                    Nagy
