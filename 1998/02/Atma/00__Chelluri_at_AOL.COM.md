                                        Brahmaiva Satyam

When asked to show atma sthanam we put our hand on the right side of heart for
the location of atma.
With my minimal knowlegde in chakras I understand that Anahata Chakra is
located there.
Could anybody shed more light why we point to right side of heart instead
whole body.    Some one might say body is not atma.  If it is not what else?
