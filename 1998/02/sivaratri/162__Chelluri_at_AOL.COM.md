                                            Om Namasivaya

I perform nitya anushatanam (daily rituals) after sunrise whereever am at that
partcular time on this planet.  I do not add or deduct time to suit indian
IST.

In south India most people follow Rahu Kalam to avoid doing some tasks.  Rahu
kalam, I suppose is based on sun rise.

If we have to follow IST for various rituals, we end up doing pratah
sandhyavandam at 6 PM previous day.  In midwest we are 12 hours behind IST.

Sivaratri is on wednesday February 25th or any other day you believe
sincerely.

                               May the mercy of Siva be with you.
