Namaste.

What is one's word ? It is a statement made by the individual ego, which
I fully agree that the individual ego should honour. Valuing the word and
even throwing the life out for it is a noble act. But isn't there an
attachment to it blindly ? This attachment to the word is by the ego of
the individual, not the SELF. The SELF does not have attachments. If the
individual's word is attacked by the others (either in meetings,
conferences or scientific discussions or in other contexts) why get
bothered about it ? I think it is a dogma that one's word has to be valued
beyond anything. While it is a sign of chivalry, in my view, it is not a
sign of seeking Truth. My thinking is: be detached, see it from distance.
That does not mean that the individual does not have faith in his/her own
word. It means simply, even if the word is maligned, there is no need for
alarm.

My views on the subject-title are further clarified in my other post on
the subject in response to Shri Anand Hudli's comment.

Aren't we all ?  But, really, is it in our hands ?
