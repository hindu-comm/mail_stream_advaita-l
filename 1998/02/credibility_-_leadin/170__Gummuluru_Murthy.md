Namaste.

Firstly, I welcome Shri Anand Hudli back to the List. I look forward to
reading his well-thought-out views with good references to sources.

Yes, I agree to some extent. In my view, the sattva, rajas, and tamas
guNAs are an indication of one's lack or otherwise of desire. The
fundamental and the only requirement for an aspirant of Self-realization
is lack of desire (in anything worldly). If the human is without desire,
then the other characteristics mentioned above would follow. The human
develops sAttvic  attitude in life and that would show up. The sAttvic
behaviour is an indicator of lack of desire and hence is an effect. It is
not a means to Self-realization. The point I was trying to make in my post
of yesterday (which I might not have made clearly as seen from responses
from others also) is the following: Whether a human is a philanthrapist,
a volunteer, or a bank-robber, if he is interested in the effect of the
work (either in the form of name, fame, or worldly pleasure) that person
is as far from realizing the Truth as anyone else. After all, isn't that
the essence of Gita ?

It is true that a philanthapist or a volunteer has more sAttvic behaviour
than a bank-robber or a common criminal. In my view, it is an effect of an
inner human characteristic, the lack of desire (relatively to a bank
robber as an example). If this philanthrapist - volunteer has a desire
for name and fame that goes with the work, this desire is in no way better
or more acceptable (as far as Self-realization is concerned) than the
desire of the bank-robber or a common criminal for instant gratification
or whatever.
