Namaste.

As per my understanding, there are some mis-conceptions in the above
question. Firstly, the Self is formless and would not assume any form.
It is ignorance (I mean not the worldly ignorance, but ignorance of the
Self) that makes one think that the Self assumes various forms.

Self cannot have memory associated with It either. The Self is a witness,
without any association with any of the upAdhis. When jeeva is not the
ultimate jnAna, the jeeva in the form of the intellect tries to find
reason for (i)  what it thinks is a continuity in the jeeva's memory
and, (ii) also jeeva's karma and taking forward these karmic effects.
Then it (the jeeva) tries to invoke rebirth etc as an explanation. At
paramArtha (when the jeeva becomes jnAnam), there is no need for any
explanation.
