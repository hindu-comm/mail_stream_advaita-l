It's interesting because the texts I have (in both Sanskrit and Gujarati)
say Skanda.  According to my understanding of the Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi
there should be vriddhi of this noun if it is in the sense of "the Purana
by Skanda" or "the Purana concerning Skanda" but not if it is "the Purana
_called_ Skanda".  As far as I can tell, not having the entire text, this
Purana is mainly about Vishnu Bhagavan so the latter sense seems more
appropriate IMO.
