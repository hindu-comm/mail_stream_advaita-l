                                          Brahmaiva Satyam

In sanskrit every letter from Aa is called a bijaakshara and each letter is
associated with a deity.

Example:  AAM  is  Vishnu; DUM for Durga;   GAM for Ganapati

Does anyother language has similar connotation.  If any other language please
post
