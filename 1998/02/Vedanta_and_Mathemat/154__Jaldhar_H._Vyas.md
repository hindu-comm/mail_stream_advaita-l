While we do indeed have a rich mathematical heritage, it has nothing to do
with Vedanta really.  Rather the first mathematical formulas
we have (in the Shulvasutras) deal with problems involved in building
altars for Vedic yagnas.  Jyotish provided another impetus and in fact
ganit is considered a branch of jyotish.

This is equally true of mathematics.  Mathematics cannot be "proved" in
its entirety either.  (In fact no logical system can be entirely
self-consistent)  If you take a different set of postulates, you can come
up with an equally valid Mathematics.  In the case of the various schools
of Vedanta and Mimamsa, axioms are not based on beliefs but on words--The
words of the Veda.  This does leave some room for ambiguity (otherwise
there would not be multiple darshans) but no more than any other logical
system.
