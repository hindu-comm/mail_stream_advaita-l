Non-dual philosophy is an archetypal dynamic existing at the
base of all human expressions of [what may be variously referred
to] as 'the Ageless Wisdom Teachings,' 'the Secret Doctrine,'
'Esotericism,' 'Gnostic Philosophy,' 'Occult Science,' "Wisdom
of the Ancients,' and 'Perrenial Philosophy.' It is found in the
secret tenets within the Gnostic Gospels, Cabala, Dhammapada,
Book of Thoth, Zend Avesta, Bardo Thodol, and many vedantic works,
such as Adavaita Bodha Deepika, Tripura Rahasya, Ribhu Gita, and,
in my opinion, most directly of all works in *any* tradition of
the 'Perrenial Philosophy,' Astavakra Samhita.

It should be stressed that this non-dual philosophy amounts to a
conceptualization process that merely points toward or indicates
the presence of an incomprehensible existential dynamic we call
jnana ('Holy Spirit,' 'Sophia,' 'Ain Soph,' 'Philosopher's Stone.').
It is thus only a *temporary* strategy with the implied necessity
that it itself be annihilated after its mission is accomplished.
In sravana, manana, and nididhyasana (hearing, reflecting, and
realizing or being [that which you are ever, beyond linear
comprehension or miniature thought worlds, for example]), the
sadhana of sravana and manana comprise and utilize the advaitic
philosophy, whereas nididhyasana entails its applied transcendence
or destruction.  Incidentally, the final [intellectual] insights
in sravana entail learning that the effective machinery behind
non-dual philosophy amounts to nothing more than a counter-weapon
[for diffusing the insistance of the comparative relationing
mind-habit--or the construct of thought itself, a linear limit].
Again, when its purpose is achieved, it is thereafter discarded.

Namaste.
