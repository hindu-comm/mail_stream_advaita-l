G Murthy's tail quote, "When all desires in the heart have fallen away, the
individual attains Brahman even here". Is this from Katha or Brhadaranyaka
Upanishad? S Radhakrishnan quotes this verse in his book on Dhammapada, but
references it to Brhadaranyaka.

Historical question :
Various books have differing opinions on who Gaudapada is saluting in his
karika (Can someone explain the exact Sanskrit words?). Some say Buddha and
others, Narayana. If it's the former, then is he the first Advaitic teacher
(OK, after Vyasa and a nastika one at that)?
