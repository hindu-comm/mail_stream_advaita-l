sarvebhyo namaH,
  "vivekachuuDaamaNii" states in verse 170:

  svapne.arthashuunye sR^ijati svashaktyaa
bhoktraadivishvaM mana eva sarvam.h |
  tathaiva jaagratyapi no visheShastatsarvam-
etanmanaso vijR^imbhaNam.h ||

  "In dreams, when there is no actual contact
with the external world, the mind alone creates
the whole universe consisting of the experiencer,
etc. (That is, the experiencer, the experienced,
and experience: subject, object, and their
coming into relation.) Similarly, in the waking
state also, there is no difference. Therefore,
all this (phenomenal universe) is the projection
of the mind."
