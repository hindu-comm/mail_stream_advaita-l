 It was at this time, when he was travelling through the kingdom on foot,
that he composed the mArga bhandU stotram. (prayer to the one who is a
friend for the traveller) this stotra is extremely poetic, and talks of
the glories of Mahadeva. Recitation of this stotra is recommended on a
daily basis as it bestows freedom from fear of any kind.
 According to Sri Appaiah Dikshidhar himself, the very word Mahadeva is
so full of mystic that it takes several births of piety to even be able
to utter it. Uttering Mahadeva Mahadeva Mahadeva (three times :-)) is
said to scare even Lord Yama away.

SambhO Mahadeva.
