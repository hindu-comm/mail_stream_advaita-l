Swami Chinmayananda also speaks of these three (satyaM j~naanam-anaantaM)
as "non-qualifying attributes" of Brahman.  Each one is a way of explaining
how Brahman is not limited.

    satyaM - unlimited by non-being or causality
    j~naanam - unlimited by avidya or Maya or space
    anaantaM - unlimited by mental modifications or vrittis

Greetings Ravi:

nArAyaNa gAyatri is in praise of Maha Vishnu and a rigorous explanation
comes after reading the Essence of gAyatri Mahamantra. Giri's Homepage
at the WEB Address: http://www.geocities.com/RodeoDrive/1415/ contains
the meaning of gaYatri mantra in greater detail.  A quick outline of the
meaning of gAyatri mantra is given below.

Wish you all the best and have a nice day!

Gayatri is a Mantra(vedic hymn) which inspires righteous wisdom its
meaning is that the Almighty God may illuminate our intellect which
may lead us to righteous path. This is most important teaching. All
the problems of a person are solved if he is endowed with the gift
of righteous wisdom. Having endowed with far sighted wisdom, a
man is neither entangled in calamity nor does he tread wrong path.
Righteous wisdom stars emerging as soon as a methodical recitation
of this Mantra is performed.

OM                      Almighty God
BHOOR                   Embodiment of vital or spiritual energy
BHUVAHA                 Destroyer of suffering
SWAHA                   Embodiment of happiness
TAT                     That (indicating God)
SAVITUR                 Bright, luminous, like and sun
VARENIYAM               Supreme, best
HARGO                   Destroyer of sins
DEVASYA                 Divine
DHEEMAHI                May receive
DHIYO                   Intellect
YO                      Who
NAHA                    Our
PRACHODAYAT             May inspire

Translated it means: "O God, Thou art the giver of life, the remover of
pain and sorrow, the bestower of happiness; O Creator of the Universe,
may we receive thy supreme, sin-destroying light; may Thou guide our
intellect in the right direction."
