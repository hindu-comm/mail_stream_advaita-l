I came across this interesting piece on another list :

One can understand this argument by reference to the Devanagari spelling
of the word "Bhagvaan".  Then, we can say that Bh = Bhoomi (Earth); G =
Gagan (Ether/Space); V = Vaayu (Air); Aa = Aag/Agni (Fire); and N = Neer
(Water).  These then are the five basic elements of which all matter -
and thus Nature - is composed.  Hence, Nature is simply another word for
God.
