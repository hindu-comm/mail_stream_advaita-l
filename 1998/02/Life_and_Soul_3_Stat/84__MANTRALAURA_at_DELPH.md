sarvebhyo namaH:
  So far I have only been quoting from shrii
Adi shaNkaraachaarya's "prakaarana" books,
"tattvabodha" and "aatmaabodha". In the invocation
of "tattvabodha", shrii shaNkara salutes his
personal guru, shrii govinda bhagavadpada,
govinda being a synonym for shrii vaasudeva:
(Please note that when writing Sanskrit, ITRANS
is being used, the reason for lower case letters
at the beginning of words and proper nouns)

  vaasudevendrayogiindraM
natvaa j~naanapradaMgurum.h |
  mumukShuuNaaM hitaarthaaya
tattvabodhobhidhiiyate ||

  "Having saluted shrii vaasudeva, who is the
bestower of j~naana (the knowledge of the Truth),
the "tattvabodha" (the knowledge of the Truth) is
expounded for the benefit of the seekers after
liberation."

  Both Apte's and Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-
English dictionaries agree that "aachaarya" and
"guru" mean "a spiritual guide or preceptor, holy
teacher, a religious teacher".

  More from Apte's regarding "taijasa":

taijasa:  "The highly refined or subtle
essence (Vedaanta phil.)"

praaj~na:  "Intellectual; wise, learned, clever;
intelligence dependent on individuality."

  More from shree shaNkara's "tattvabodha"
regarding the three states of consciousness:

  ataH suShuptyavasthaa kaa?

  "Then, what is the deep-sleep state?"

  ahaM kimapi na jaanaami sukhena mayaa
nidraa.anubhuuyata iti suShuptyavasthaa |
  kaaraNashariiraabhimaanii aatmaa praaj~na
ityuchyate |

  "That state about which one says later 'I did
not know anything; I have well enjoyed a good
sleep' is the deep sleep state.
  The Self, identifying itself with the causal
body (in the deep sleep state) is called 'praaj~na'.
(praayena aj~na: i.e. almost ignorant)."

  Further, "During this state it is only aware of
the thought 'I don't know'.  The self in this
state is designated as praaj~na, meaning the one
who is nearly ignorant. Because the consciousness
is present during this state, the self is not
totally ignorant, but nearly ignorant."
