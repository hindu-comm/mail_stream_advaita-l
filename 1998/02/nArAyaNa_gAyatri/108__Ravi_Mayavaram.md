namaskaaram

Can someone give a detailed meaning of nArAyaNa gayatri, which is

AUM nArAyaNAya vidmahe vAsudevAya dhImahI |
tanno vishhNuH prachodayat ||

I understand this as

I meditate on Lord vAsudevA, who is known as
nArAyaNa, may He, Lord vishhNu awaken [Atma jnanam in] me.

Please correct me and give a rigorous explanation.

Thanks for your help.

Ravi
AUM namo nArAyaNAya
