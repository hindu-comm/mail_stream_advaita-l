Namaste:
 It is not an established fact that one who has attained Brahman is a
Brahmana. There are a few other prerequisites. Some of them include daily
recitation of the Vedas, performing yajnas etc. Apart from these, a
Brahmana is also supposed to spend some time teaching the Vedas and
accepting gifts from people who want to give. It is established through
several instances in Vedic literature that only a Brahmana can teach the
Veda and only a Brahmana can accept gifts (alms) at ceremonies.
 Given such requirements, realisation of Brahman is not given any special
priority. In addition, there are examples of Rishis challenging Kings to
debates for no purpose other than to stimulate intellectual debate in the
land. i am not saying that the above quoted story is to be seen as
accomplishing that, nevertheless ...

Cheers,
Vaidya.
