sarvebhyo namaH,
  Regarding Nagy's question about the universe last
week, it is my understanding that Brahman/Atman is
the universe - the REAL, all-pervading universe.
However, there is the objective, phenomenal universe,
which, like the unreal Atma that we associate the I/ego
with, which is limited and is destroyed when we realize
the truth. The objective universe was created, but the
vishva that is real (Brahman) always was, without
beginning and, therefore, without an end.

dhanyavaadaH,
  Mantralaura
