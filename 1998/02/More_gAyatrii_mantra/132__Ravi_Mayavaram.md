I read this gAyatrii in durga sUktam. In the book "Lalita cult",
I remember reading that  it is addressed to agni durga ( book gives
a list of different aspects/kinds of durga).

I have book on shrii vidya, it gives gaayatris for navagrahams also.
In fact sometimes disciples create gaaytri in  a similar format
towards their gurus, I have come across one such gaayatri too.
