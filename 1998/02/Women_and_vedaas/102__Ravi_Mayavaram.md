Thanks for your suggestion. In fact even I think that one should be
properly intiated to sandhya at a very young age. In fact my
upanayanam ceremony was promptly done when I was 10 years old.

But books are still useful to review, remember and relearn few things
which one might miss due to oversight at times.
