Actually i don't fault the Sanskrit books published by the RK mission.
They usually have less errors than many of the books printed in India.
It's the interpretations which are no good.

If you or someone you know gets a chance to go to India (or maybe a local
priest can help you), you should get proper instruction in Sandhyavandana.
It's a very important thing for a Brahman to know.
