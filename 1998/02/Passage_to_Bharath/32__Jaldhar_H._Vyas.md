Indeed but don't sell this country short.  Everythings a lot more
disorganized and it's hard to find the time but if you make the effort
there are people here you can learn a lot from too.  Still I'd love to be
able to spend some time there.  I hope to be able to go at the end of this
year.

This is why our shastras proclaim the glory of satsang.  Just being in the
presence of the great can be so beneficial.  Nevertheless you missed out
on a good chance to ask questions.  As the word acharya suggessts, that is
his main function.

Intrigued by Vaidyas comment, I've been doing some research on this.  See
my post on the subject.

If you want to meet an Indian Buddhist, your best bet is to find an
archaeologist.  Maybe he can dig up the remains of one for you.

It's true.  Sometimes you have to be at a distance to see what you took
for granted before.
