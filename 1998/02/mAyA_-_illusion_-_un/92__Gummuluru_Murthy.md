Namaste. I can certainly empathize with your views.

My concern is not that much about understanding across cultural
boundaries. Apart from the difficulties you mentioned (lack of exact
equivalent in the other language, importance of sound etc), our lack
of complete knowledge of the Sanskrit language is another problem.
With us being habituated to thinking in the English poses a problem
for proper understanding of the Vedas. The other day I was trying to
explain the word "shraddha" to a few children. I could not find either
the proper english equivalent word, or the proper combination of words
to explain that. I would take it that mithya is illusion, but the
concept of mAyA is not understood even by the Sanskrit scholars. Our
lack of full knowledge of Sanskrit and habituation to thinking in a
different language which does not have a proper word for it does not
help.

I agree with you that translators do the best they can. I think it is
Charles Wikner who commented once (on this List) that the words the
translators use depend on their understanding of the advaitic concepts.
Thus, if their understanding (of the advaitic concepts, not the mastery
of Sanskrit-English) is not right, a wrong concept is unfortunately
propogated.
