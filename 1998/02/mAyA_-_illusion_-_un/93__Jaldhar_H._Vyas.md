Then the answer is straightforward.  Dishabituate yourself to thinking in
English!

Then explain it to them in Tamil or Telugu or whatever your native tounge
is.  And if they don't understand that, teach them that first and then
move on to other subjects.  We don't teach people calculus until we've
taught them arithmetic etc. first, why should culture be any different?

Speaking as a member of the second generation, the best thing that my
parents did for me was teaching me how to read and write Gujarati.  That
gave me access to a whole world of knowledge that would have otherwise
been denied to me.  And because I didn't have to deal with error-prone and
biased English translations, I got much higher-quality information too.

You could say the same about difficult English concepts such as "human
rights"  Who can say exactly what all the nuances of that word are?  But
we can have a good enough idea for practical purposes.  I think i know
what Maya means and I'm sure plenty of people do.
