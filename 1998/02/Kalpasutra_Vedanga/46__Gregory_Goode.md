Be silent
Silence the will
Silence the hate
Silence the ego
Silence the ignorance
Silence the fear
Silence the body
Silence the mind
Silence the intellect
Silence the action
Silence the death
Silence the spirit
Silence the thought
Be silent!

Some speak ... and say nothing.
Some are silent ... because they have nothing to say.
Some are silent ... to listen.
Some are silent ... so as not to tell the truth.
Some are silent ... so as not to tell a lie.
Some are silent ... because they are afraid.
Some are silent ... because they are proud.
Some are silent ... and in their own way eloquent.
God is the most eloquent of all those who are silent.
Verbania, 4 1V 1991

Greetings Nanda:

Please feel free to express your ideas as it pleases you.  Religion has
no bounds and ends. As Swami Vivekananda points out in the following
quotation that everyone including you or me is potentially divine. All
expressions are the reflection of the manifestation of the divinity.

Have a nice and peaceful day!


" Every soul is potentially Divine. The goal of life is to manifest this
Divine within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this
either by work, or worship, or by psychic control, or philosophy, by one
or more or all of  these - and be free. This is the whole of religion.
Doctrines of dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms  are but
secondary details."

Raja Yoga, from Swami Vivekananda, The Practice of Yoga
