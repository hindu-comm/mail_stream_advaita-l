> What is a Kalpasutra?  What is a Vedanga?

A kalpasUtra is a text that gives details of rituals. A typical text has
portions labelled SrautasUtras (public Vedic ritual), gRhyasUtras
(domestic ritual) and dharmasUtras (covers all other aspects of dharma).

A vedAnga is a subsidiary field of study in the Vedic tradition, a field
that goes hand in hand with the Vedas. Usually, six are enumerated,
including jyotisha (astronomy/astrology), nirukta (etymology in a very
special sense), vyAkaraNa (grammer) etc. A vedAnga must be distinguished
from the upaveda-s like Ayurveda, gAndharvaveda etc.
