namaskaaraM Ravi,
  If you would like to hear the viShNu
gaayatrii chanted by Swaami Viditatmaananda,
he chants it on the "Morning puujaa / Evening
puujaa" cassette that Arsha Vidya Gurukulam
has in the book store. It is chanted during the
morning puujaa after the naaraayaNa suuktam
and just before the viShNu suuktam.

OM shaantiH, shaantiH, shaantiH

dhanyavaadaH,
  Mantralaura
