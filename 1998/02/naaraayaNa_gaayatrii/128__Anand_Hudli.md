 I think we are dealing with different traditions here. I belong to
 the Shaakala shaakhaa of the R^ig Veda, and the Ashvalaayana suutra.
 My nitya karma book, which includes the daily puuja, does not
 necessarily include the nArAyaNa suukta (after which the nArAyaNa
 gAyatrii is usually chanted). R^ig Vedins typically chant the
 Purushha suukta (the R^ig Vedic version, which does not involve
 the uttara nArAyaNa portion chanted by the Yajur Vedins). This
 Purushha suukta is followed by the VishNu suukta (again R^ig Vedic
 version). Typically, we skip the nArAyaNa suukta which belongs to the
 Krishna Yajur Veda.

 I suspect the Shukla Yajur Vedins too skip the nArayaNa suukta.
 Probably, that is why Jaldhar did not find it in his
 book.

 But I am sure the Krishna Yajur Vedins chant the nArAyaNa suukta
 followed by the nArAyaNa (or VishhNu) gAyatrii during their puujaa.
 The nArAyaNa suukta occurs in the MahaanArAyaNa upanishhad of the
 Krishna Yajur Veda.

 Anand
