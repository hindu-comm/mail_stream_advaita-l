I heard from my friend that nArAyaNa gAyatri IS in fact chanted during
the morning pa.nchAyatana pUjA. Usually it is chanted after the
nArAyaNa sUktam.  That is the tradition. I have asked his permission
to forward the complete mail.

BTW nArAyaNa sUktam is very beautiful to chant. I am sure Jaguar site
must be having it.

with respects,
Ravi
