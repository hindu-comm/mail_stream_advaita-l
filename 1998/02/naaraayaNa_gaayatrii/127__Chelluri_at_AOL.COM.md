Ravi your point is well taken. rudeness and impoliteness does not belong.

Sri Vyas used the wrong word I think.  May be it has different meaning.

Some fake swamis and socalled fake saints are out there for money.  It is our
responsibility to alert whom we like.   Most people believe one who calls
himself a swami or swamini.  Recently I posted an ugly act by paramacharya not
giving tirtham to an young tamilian girl because she became a widow.  Is it
her fault?
Nobody made any comment except Ramachandran about changing attitudes with
changing times.  I know the reason too.  Most blindly believe ceaser's wife
can not be wrong.

One more thing I disagree with Adi shankara's guru, it does not become a focal
point to condemn me.   A simple request of restraint suffice.
