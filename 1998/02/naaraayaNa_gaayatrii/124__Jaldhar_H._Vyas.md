Unfortunately much of what is taught in the name of religion or philosophy
ia worthless.  Why then pretend it is?  Do you really think the idea that
the Upanishads were created by Kshatriyas to counter Brahmin ritualism is
worthy of a second thought?  (This is what I referred to in the other
thread as crap.)  Let me counter the notion I'm against being polite
because I'm not. I'm however in favor of treating topics with a respect
relative to their worth.

What constitutes a proper puja?  A puja which is full of bhakti is the
proper one.  So what is Bhakti?  Bhakti is loving service to God.  Note
here the focus is on God.  A good puja isn't what the bhakta thinks is
appropriate, but what _Bhagawan_ thinks is appropriate.  And Bhagawan has
let us know what he finds appropriate in his Shastras.

I am not familiar with Nayanars but there are many stories like this about
Saints.  Yes it shows Bhagawans karuna that even such low people have just
as much access to him as a king or sage.  As the Gita says, even a flower
or some water are acceptable if they are offered with devotion.  But just
because the minimum can be considered acceptable, should we cling to the
minimum?  Unless ignorant, poor, hunters have Internet access, we can be
pretty sure Vaidya Sundaram has more education, more money, and more time
than Kannapa Nayanar.  Therefore we should--rather you should hold
yourself--to a higher standard of behavior.  And the same for everyone
reading this including myself.  (And the standard should be twice as high
as that for someone who is taking the responsibility of being a teacher.)
The difference between a bhakta and the ordinary man is that even though
Bhagawan only asks for the minimum, the bhakta wants to give the maximum.

Hmm if I saw a poor man, half-blind, hobbling around on one leg, trying to
worship, you're right I wouldn't stand by.  If he had no water I would
fetch him some.  If had nothing to clean it with I'd bring him a cloth.
And if he didn't know what to do, _I'd_show_him_.

It's a strange kind of tolerance that would let things stand in the way
you describe above.

But the bhakta does not take this as a license to offer prayers any which
way.

And here's a thought.  As Shiva Bhagawan's own shastras have given his
Brahmin bhaktas the duty to teach, it would be interference in _my_
matters to stand in my way.

For the reason that it isn't.  Kumarila Bhatt argues against the idea that
we can find _any_ reason for the vidhis.  They are to be performed
that way because that's the way they are to be performed.  (If that sounds
like circular reasoning that's because it is but every system has its
first principles.)

In the case of the Shuklayajurveda Sandhya it is very clear what the
various puranic shlokas are doing there.  I'm sure it is the same for
yours too.

It is not the Gayatri of Maharshi Vishvamitra we're interested in, it's
the Gayatri of Sandhyavandan.  And that we know we are doing the right
way.

Says the shastras that teach the right and wrong way to do things.  Says
the people who toil away their entire lives trying to get things perfect.

> what do mean by incorrect use.

For all mantras there are rules governing their use.  When they should be
said.  Who should say them.  How many times they should be repeated to get
a certain result etc.  When this isn't done, they have no effect or less
of one.

non-removal of vighna, mispronounciation, not following instructions etc.

All absolutely true.  Here is that minimum/maximum problem again.  Just
because we acknowledge mistakes were made is not a carte blanche to make
mistakes.

So would I.  In fact I do!  These kind of people are my friends and
neighbors.  Unlike the South Indian immigrants who are mostly
city-educated professionals, a good number of the Gujaratis in Jersey City
have come straight from the villages and are shopkeepers or factory
workers.

But do you think for a minute that such people are happy to be ignorant?
No, on the contrary they are eager to know (and do) what the shastras
command.  That's why on average the second generation kids from these
Vaishnava families tend to be much more culturally literate than those
from Smarta families.  To conclude my story, when the villagers of Rajkot
district discovered the truth, they did not stick around to hear
Radhakrishnan. It wasn't the name Radha Krishna they were interested in
but Their divine presence and they knew they wouldn't find it with some
politician no matter how nice his name.

I know.  Shri Narayanas shastras tell me so :-)

How can anyone understand that stotra unless they know the rules of
grammar?
