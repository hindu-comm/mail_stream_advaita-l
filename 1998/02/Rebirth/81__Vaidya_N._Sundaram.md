Namaste:
 just a small comment ....
 In the Bhagavatam, it is reiterated on more than one occasion that real
Death is not the passing away of the body. Death is when the Soul cannot
in any way perceive that there is some thing like Brahman or Ishvara etc.
Death is when the soul cannot mediate on the Lord. As long as His names
are mediated upon, there is no *death* for the soul, only a smooth
transition from one waking state to another. This is distinct from Moksha
which is freedom from the cycle of birth and death.

Vaidya.
