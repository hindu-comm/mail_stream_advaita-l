namaste Shree,
  This is what I came up with:

 shivaM shiva-karam.h sanaathaM shivaatmaanaM
shivottamam.h |
 shiva-maarga praNe-dharaM praNa-Dho.asmi
sadaa-shivaM ||

  As you can see, I had trouble with "saantham"
and came up with "sanaathaM" (having the Lord as
Protector). This is very beautiful. Thank you
for sharing this shloka with us.

OM shaantiH, shaantiH, shaantiH

dhanyavaadaH,
  Mantralaura
