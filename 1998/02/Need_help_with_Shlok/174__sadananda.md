The second line seems to follow the anushTup chandas, but there seems to be
some problem with the first line meter.   Sanaathanam would go with the
second part of the first line. But that leaves two more words missing in
the first half of the first line? Can any one check?
 I agree you cannot put Him inside a meter!
Hari Om!
