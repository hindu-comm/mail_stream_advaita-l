 I can see that the second line has 16 syllables. But the first has
 12 syllables, assuming saantham is shaantaM.
 The second line should read (in my opinion):

  shivamaarga-praNetaaraM praNato .asmi sadaashivaM |

  I bow to Him who is the chief among those of the path of Shiva
  and who is Sadaashiva (eternally auspicious).

 Anand
