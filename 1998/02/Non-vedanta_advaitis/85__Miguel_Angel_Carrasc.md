Thank you, Govind Rengarajan, for you detailed explanations.

However, one question I asked remains unanswered:

^ÓWhat attitude do you have towards their [jnanis from different traditions]
evident discrepancies? Are they just due to different cultural backgrounds,
and/or to different audiences? Or do they really disagree with each other?
Imagine that the sages I mentioned were to meet all together before a mixed
audience of seekers - would they say the same? Would they feel that any of
them could speak as their common spokesperson?^Ó
