They may in fact disagree with each other, in totality, or at some
level. But what does one do in such a situation? Do we (this set
includes atleast one person, me ;-) have the knowledge to judge
always accurately? Of course, notwithstanding this we do in fact
judge (I do). So the alternative, which again doesn't really answer
your question, is to "seek" the truth through something you have
faith in. I have learnt that faith comes slowly but steadily.
Now, to answer your question, yes, it will be wonderful if all
"jnAnis" were to say the same exact thing. But obviously (atleast at
our level of understanding) they do not. May be it's the cultural
background, may be it's the audience, or may be, as you said
earlier, it is simply that they are not fully "realized". But does
it matter? Do you have faith in somebody/some school? Do you follow
his teachings? Only this matters, isn't it?

I can't imagine and I don't know. And to be honest, I don't care.
What purpose will it serve anyway? Increase faith? What do you
think?
