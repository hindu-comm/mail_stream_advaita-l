Smartas are the ones who follow the smriti. In fact the word Smarta is
derived from the word smriti. They are followers of Sankara too.

Reading the AmnAya stotram.h one attains benefits here in this
world and sadgati (good course) in the other. Also one will
attain mokSha and will not be born in a body again, and there is
no doubt about it.


It is traditional to give a phalashruti at the end of the
shlokam.

namste

I have the corrected version of the shankara aShTottara shata
nAmavaliH in text form in
http://www.isc.tamu.edu/guru/shankara.html

I have incorporated most of the suggestions given by shrI
Vidyasankar and shrI Charles Wikner.

The sanskrit version is in
ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/private/sanskrit/incoming/ravi/shankara-108m.ps
But it has some transliteration errors though. I will not be
working on the correction of this document for another two
months.

Please feel free to modify and correct it for your personal
needs. You can send your corrections to me as well (personal mail
and not to the list). Also be warned that the translation may
have errors.

Thank you.
