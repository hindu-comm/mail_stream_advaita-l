Note1: In the case of dvArakA maTha, the purpose was stated as
teaching the unity of jIvAtma and paramAtma. I guess we can
assume the purpose to be same here.

Note2: Funnily, I had a dream in which I was reading a book in
(written shrI chandrasekhara saravatI, former pontiff of kAnchi
maTha) explaining this stotram in detail, unfortunately I don't
remember anything now ;-))
