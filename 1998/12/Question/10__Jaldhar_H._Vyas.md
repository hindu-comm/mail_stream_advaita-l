Once Vidyashankar recommended to me a book called "Society and Sannyasin:
A History of the Dasnami Sannyasins" which was written by an insider,
Swami Sadananda Giri.  There was another book on the subject by A.S.
Ghurye whose name I've forgotten.  Both were available at the New York
Public library.  Maybe you could get hold of them by interlibrary loan or
something?

Anyway I believe the Swami stated that the four disciples had ten
disciples of their own called Giri, Aranya etc. and that's why there are
10 orders.  I don't know how much of this is true or legend but that was
the tradition the author knew.

As far as I know, the order of a sannyasi depends only on the order of his
dikshaguru.  Sometimes even the first name is made this way.  E.g. all the
Sannyasis of Kanchi Matha are *indra Saraswati.

That I couldn't tell you.  If the tradition mentioned above is true, it
would appear to be none.

If it is not a guru-shishya relationship then why do dvaita sannyasis
continue to have the name Tirth?  They do not seem to have any ideological
need to do so.

I don't doubt his talents but it is completely non-controversial that his
guru was an Advaitin (Achyutapreksha Tirth) and he later repudiated that
doctrine. (See http://www.dvaita.org/madhva/AnandaT_1.html)  No doubt the
Dvaitins have some justification for this behavior but I've drawn my
conclusion.
