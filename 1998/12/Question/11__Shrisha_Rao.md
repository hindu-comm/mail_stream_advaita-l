Why do you say that?  I would say that only post-14th-century Advaitins
do.  There is no proper textual or epigraphical tradition dating back to
Sri Shankara himself which would confirm such a thesis, and truly enough,
other traditions do not accept that he founded the order.  (I invite you
to find one example of a non-Advaitic source of some antiquity, which
"admits" what you say.)  There is, sad to say, a significant "horizon
effect" where Sri Shankara is concerned, among Advaitins and others, owing
to the lack of information concerning teachers prior to him, and without
tending to disrespect him, it would be fair to say that imagining that he
is the founder of all Vedanta or Vedantic traditions, is unacceptable.
There is enough evidence in his own writings to reject such a theory.

Refer above.
