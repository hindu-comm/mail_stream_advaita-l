An "ideological need" is purely on the basis of the assumption that the
title was created by Advaitins, however.  Note this fact.

Where "he" refers to the guru?  Quite true.

The book mentioned by Jaldhar, by Sadanandagiri points out evidence that
there is epigraphical evidence for the earliest dashanAmi akhADas to the
9th-10th century AD. After Vidyasankar returns I'm sure he'll post a
scholarly article. May I point out that lack of epigraphical evidence
does not mean anything? There is _no_ epigraphical evidence for either
sha.nkara or sureshvara. The reason is rather simple. In sha.nkara's
times sannyAsis were recluses and were not associated with kingdoms.
Sureshvara's writing make this amply clear and he refuses to conider
anyone other than sannyAsis as disciples. By the time of Vidyashankara
there was a connection between politics and advaita. This was necessary
due to the muslim invasions. After that the dashanAmI tradition has been
quite influential in political circles also.

Ditto.

May I request an end to this thread unless anyone has solid historical
evidence to talk about? Thank you.

Which, nonetheless, does not show that their originator was Shankara.
There is evidence that the title `tIrtha', at least, dates from the
time before Shankara himself.
