 Where detachment and desire for release are not pronounced, sama etc.,
are unreal like a reflection in a mirage.

 If viraktatA and mumukshutA are not pronounced, then they are transient
appearances like water in a mirage. When the sun is very hot, and the
appearance of water is there, it is only a mirage. Going near no water is
obtained, nor is the thrist quenched. For a weary man, this is even man
painfull as he has taken added pains to reach a mirage. Even so, in the
absence of tivravairAgya and mumukshutA, sama etc are only illusory
appearances like water in a mirage; such a one does not reap the fruits
of sama etc., nor is he described by others as saanta etc.

This gross body is produced by one's karma in past life, out of the
elements which have  themselves  transformed, and is the instrument
of the  jiva's  experience.  That is its waking  state in  which it
experiences gross objects.  -- Adi Shankara in VivekacUdAmani.
