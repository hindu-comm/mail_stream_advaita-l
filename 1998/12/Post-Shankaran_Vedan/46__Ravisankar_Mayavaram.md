This list is specifically focussed towards discussing advaita
vedAnta as taught by bhagavAn shrI shankara. He and his disciples
are the key to his list. The shankara maTha-s and their branches
have strive utmost to preserve the tradition and those great
teachers are our focus. Many of the important names are listed in
Vidya's page and even Jaldhar mentioned them.

There are many contemporary teachers and definitely their
disciples consider them to be established in brahman. If we start
discussing their teachings in a full fledged form in the list,
then it will become ramakrishna-L, nisargadatta-L, or something
like this. I mean no disrespect to these great teachers. I rever
them all sincerely. But for all practical purposes, advaita-L is
shankara-L.  I thought this was made amply clear in the
introduction (List policy) sent to you.

Again I request you read the archives. Before the list's policy
was made very focussed (a year back), so many items were
discussed in great detail.

To your question answer is a big NO unless the contemporary
personality you are talking about is a shankarAcharya. In which
case his teachings will be identical to that of bhagavAn shrI
shankara. I dont want to discuss any further on this issue.

Since you said you deliver talks and teach Hinduism, please
discuss about what you teach about bhagavAn shrI shankara and his
teachings. That will be most useful to the list.

With love and respects,
Ravi
