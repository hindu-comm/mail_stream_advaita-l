jay replying: - Define truth if it is knowable. I am keen to be able to get
to this 'truth'
all my life.


V: The same answer also covers the points raised about the value of
language,
 truth and history.


j:   then the excellent verses from the shashtra that say:-
    "This cannot be achieved by studying too many shashtras
      or that this is the knowledge where the teacher keeps quiet and the
      student has understood"  All these are worthless poetry too?



j:  The grand thing about Advaita is that it cannot be a statement of
affairs.

Jay replies:  ""Ah the daily and the divine should not be confused - they
are different""
This cannot be true.  The most mundane and the highest have no demaracation
lines.

j:   Thank 'Advaita' that it is not a subject of history, language or logic
else it will be so dry!!   :-}
