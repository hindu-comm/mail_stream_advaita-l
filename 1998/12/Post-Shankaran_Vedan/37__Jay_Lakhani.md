Namaste to all

Let us discuss some aspects of Advaita.

Let the aim not be logic chopping.
Let the aim not be history mongering.
Let the aim not be linguistic gymnastics.

To learn Advaita we need to focus on ''One who is established in Advaita''
Can we discuss the life and teachings of one such contemporary personality?

yours in adviata  - jay
