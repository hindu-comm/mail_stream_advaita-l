I would say...

Shankaracharya wrote important works explaining and defending his teachers
positions on the relationship between karma and Jnana.

Shriharsha

His Khandanakhandakhadya is the first great polemical work of Advaita

logical grounds.

Advaita Vedanta.

The leading Advaitin of his generation and polemicist against Dvaita.
He clearly and cogently explained the relationship between Jnana and
Bhakti.

Vivekananda

The most important person on this list in terms of "propagating" Advaita
philosophy.  The least important in terms of "best understood"

Vedanta.
