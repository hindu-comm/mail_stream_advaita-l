I think you wanted to say shrI chandrasekharendra sarasvatI
former pontiff of kanchi kAmakoTi pItha. Collection of his talks
called "deivaththin kural" (the voice of God) edited by Ra.
Ganapati (this series runs to 8 volumes), some parts of it was
translated into English (I think two volumes), is very famous.
The English translation is called "Hindu dharma : the universal
way of life / Chandrasekharendra Sarasvati Svami". This book and
many other books edited from his talks are available from the UT
library. http://dpweb1.dp.utexas.edu/lib/utnetcat/

  He is popularly known as periyava and now his successor shrI
jayendra sarasvati is also known by the same title. The term
periyava literally means the "great one" in thamizh. There is
nice WWW page  http://www.kamkoti.org/ describing about the
kAmakoTi maTha.

I'm afraid you miss the point of the purpose of learning spopen Sanskrit.
It is NOT meant to be a subsitute for learning vyAkaraNa, which we know to
be one of the vedAnga's.  Learning through this method breaks down the
preconceived notion that Sanskrit is impossibly difficult.  As you point
out, one learns one's mother tongue by immersing oneself in it by being
around people who speak it.  This is also true of learning other languages.
It is the only way I was able to learn French, German and Russian. In all
cases, including and particularly Sanskrit, grammer obviously follows.  The
courses on Spoken Sanskrit raise awareness of what is possible, and also
develop a desire to learn more.  I have met people who, having attended
these courses, have gone on to study up to MA level in Sanskrit.

        This, I believe, is exactly the point.  The "current" system in
India of teaching Sanskrit is NOT the traditional method of teaching
Sanskrit, as it is an ape of how Latin and Ancient Greek are taught (witness
the following comment in a textbook for learning ancient Greek "since
Ancient Greek is no longer spoken, we can be less concerned about how it is
pronounced"-Hardly a recipe for learning Sanskrit!). Note, however, moves to
teach Latin through spoken means. Words on the traditional method follow
below.

The traditional method encompasses both conversation and grammer side by
side. In this day and age different people approach language learning in
different ways. If you can learn both in parallel in the traditional manner,
then great. If not, your experience of learning other languages will be the
best guide as to what is most appropriate for you.

Agreed-it requires both head and heart.  Learning spoken Sanskrit is not a
gimmick and shortcut. It is in fact an integral part of the ancient
traditional method of learning Sanskrit.  The more we believe such
approaches to be gimmicks and shortcuts, the more disservice we do to
Sanskrit, as we help reinforce the idea that it is a dead language.  A
language has many parts, of which conversation, literature, and grammer are
its foundation.  Let us not rob Sanskrit of one of its legs.
