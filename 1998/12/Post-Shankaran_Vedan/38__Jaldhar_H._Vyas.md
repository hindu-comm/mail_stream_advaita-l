Ok but,

Without logic how will you make any sense of the evidence that Advaita
presents?  How can you correctly choose between contradictory claims?  How
can one discover truth if one isn't even sure what truth is?

Without language what how will you understand what other Advaitins have
said?

Without history how can you understand the circumstances in which Advaita
has come to some conclusions and not others?

All these things are necessary to understand Vedanta properly and I can
assure you no chopping, splitting, or gymnastics are involved.

Why?

I suspect you have a particular contemporary personality in mind. :-)
