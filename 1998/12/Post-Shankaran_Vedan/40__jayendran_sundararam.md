I have been enjoying the discussions so far. But I do not understand the
furore created over acknowledging the most popular teacher. Even
Chandrasekara Saraswati himself personally acknowledged the greatness of
Jayendra Saraswati to his disciples. I think it is rather
unparlimentary to make statements in this regard.
