There is ample evidence to support the view that Sanskrit at one time was
indeed flourishing as a spoken language. Witness the use of language of
bhAsa in his plays, and the language of the vAlmIki rAmAyaNa which, although
written in verse form, is flowing with a style that could only have come
from a language that was actually spoken Also, pANini's last sutra "a a
iti", which closes out his teaching by saying "now from the vedic "a", we
restore the "a" we use when we speak". That is to say that he is concluding
the "teaching" bit, and now it is time to get back into normal "speaking"
mode.

I think you have summed it up beautifully, and I thank you for all your
learned observations.  Other members of the list will have been able to draw
their own conclusions from the discussions we have had, and I will have no
more to say in the matter. I wish all members the best in their Sanskrit
studies (whatever form this may take) as they use that to reveal the
teachings of vedAnta.
