Subject: Pls forward to Advaita List

Sri Ravishankar,
Namaste!  This is Vidya Kaushik from Austin.  I wonder if you could post
the following message to the group if you feel it is appropriate.

Namaste to the group members.  This is my first posting to this list.  I
have been following the postings for a few months and I am simply awed
by the collective wealth of knowledge and wisdom that forms the basis of
this group.
I wanted to ask a question about a prAkarana grantha called Drg Drsya
Viveka.  It is an excellent small text that is taught by teachers of the
Chinmaya Mission tradition and by Swami Dayananda at Arsha Vidya
Gurukulam in Saylorsburg PA.  There appears to be some uncertainty as to
the authorship of this text as to whether it is by Sankara or by
Vidyaranya.  I wondered if any of the experts could confirm the
authorship.
Also, to those living in the Austin area or nearby, the following note
may be of interest to those interested in Sanskrit.  If there are any
reviews of this short course by people on this list who have taken it
before, that would be welcome.  Thx,
-Vidya
