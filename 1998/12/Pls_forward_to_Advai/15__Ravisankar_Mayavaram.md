namaste shrI Vidya Kaushik

dR^ig dR^iShya viveka was written by shrI bhArati tIrthA who is
the guru of shrI vidyAraNyasvAmin. There is a nice translation of
the work published by the Ramakrishna Mutt. It is very
inexpensive (2+ dollars). It is by shrI nikhilAnanda and it
carries the foreword of by shrI subrahmaNya aiyar. This book also
discusses about the authorship issue in the introduction.


In fact this question was answered on the very first week of the
List (May 1996) our Vidyasankar Sundaresan.
