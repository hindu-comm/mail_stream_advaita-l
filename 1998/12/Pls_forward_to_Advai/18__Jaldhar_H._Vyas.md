Well I'm only going by what was posted which seemed to suggest otherwise.
I'm happy to be proved wrong on this.

I've been thinking about this.  Although the "negative reinforcement" many
people get in school is a factor I believe Indians think Sanskrit is
really difficult for a different, more psychological reason.  It's because
of the awe and reverence we feel towards the language that we actually
_want_ it to be "impossibly difficult."  As the saying goes "familiarity
breeds contempt" and an attempt to bring Sanskrit too "down to earth" may
backfire.

I don't think that it's that obvious.  Sanskrit is in a different class
than those languages.  Although it is spoken in certain circles even to
this day, it is primararily a literary language.  That doesn't make it a
"dead" language but it is not quite a "live" one either.  Rather than
German or Russian, a better comparison to the domain-specific jargon of
say Mathematics.  It is used creatively but only in a certain context.
Although it could be used in a wider one, it generally is not.  Or many of
the Veda Pandits for instance go their entire lives without ever learning
the literal meaning of the words they have memorized but we cannot
conclude those words have no meaning for them.

To get back to the point, the sociocultural use of the Devabhasha is to
talk to the Devas not our neighbors.  And in that situation it does make
more sense to concentrate on grammar rather than speech.

I didn't mean that that's what the teacher is after but that's what will
attract students like the aunt of mine who used to hide up a tree during
Sanskrit class. :-)

I truly believe that such an approach is the best way to get people well
trained in Sanskrit.

No it isn't but people can think it is.  I think we (and no doubt Krishna
Shastriji too) agree that "LEARN SANSKRIT IN A WEEK" is more of a
marketing kind of thing (which is not necessarily a bad thing) not to be
taken literally and the idea is after a week to get people interested in
pursuing the subject for maybe a whole lifetime of study.  But people will
sometimes be attracted to the right things for the wrong reason and they
were the ones I mainly was addressing.

Again a non-spoken language is not necessarily a dead one.  A language
without meaning is dead and Sanskrit still has great meaning even to
people who do not speak it conversationally.  The approach that will work
best is the one that is most meaningful.  And by all means that approach
should be fun, just because something is serious doesn't mean it cant be
fun.  We should just keep our priorities that's all.

Conversely lets not confuse a leg with an elbow. :-)
