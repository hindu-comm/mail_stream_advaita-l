I agree with J Vyas

In fact my daughter goes to St James in London. This is an English School, a
Christian school and yet promotes Sanskrit.

Most of your comments are very apt. If someone wants to learn the language
in order to get a better grip on the philosophy of the Gita, then we have to
say good luck to them and help them out in any way we can.

If Becky needs any help my daughter will help
