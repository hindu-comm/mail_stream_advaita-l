Namaskar Vaidyaji and others,

I should apologize at the outset that I should have posed the question
keeping in mind the Advaitist concept of Atman and Brahma being one and the
same. So I indulged in a little self-delusion :) (don't we all).

>From what you have written, would it be correct on my part to assume that
since there is no independent Atman, what is reborn is actually a
manifestation of my Prana (vibration) and Sookshma Sharir. The Atman does
not undergo this trans-migratory process since its there all the time but
is unrealized. Would this be a correct perception ?

I thank everyone in advance for clarifying this for me.

Namaskarams:

 Kindly refer to the search engine of the archives of this list at
http://listserv.tamu.edu/cgi/wa?S1=advaita-l
 this question posed by you has been dealt with in one form or another
several times. It would make a good starting point for you to get
references ...

 briefly: the jIva thinks of itself as embodied due to delusion or mAya
and hence attributes to its' own action the concept or karma. And it hence
gets bound in karma and has to go thru the process of birth and death; the
actual process is REAL. That is to say, as long as you are embodied and
look at your self as Ashish Chandra, you do undergo the pains and joys of
being a human, including birth, death, old age, disease, fear and sadness
and so on ... This is vyAvahaarika sathyam. Simply saying that the soul is
one and so there is no birth cannot be said when you are in this state.
When one transends this and goes to pAramaarthika state, all is one and no
duality exists.

 as always, if I wrong, I hope knowledgeable listmembers will point it
out.

 The place, time, objects and their knower etc., projected in a dream
during sleep are all mithyA (an illusion/false). So too, here. in the
waking state, the world that is seen is a projection by one's own
ignorance. Likewise, this body, the senses, the breath, the ego etc.,
are all unreal. Therefore, That thou art, the peaceful, defectless,
supreme, non-dual Brahman.  -- Adi Shankara in VivekacUdAmani.

namaste

It is fine to quote when it is relevant.  But the baseline is
this list is for the discussion of advaita-vedAnta as taught by
shrI shankara. And our main aim to understand advaita-vedAnta as
taught by the tradition.

There is considerably flexibility within the scope (which I send
when I welcome members) and post on monthly basis.  If you have
any further questions please write to me in person and not on the
list.

with respects,

Ravi
