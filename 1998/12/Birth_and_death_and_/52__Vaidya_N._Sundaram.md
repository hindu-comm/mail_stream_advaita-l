Namaskarams:
 I am sure I did NOT say what you say below, about prAna and sookshma
sarira etc. Your original question was: "what is it that is manifested
again and again through birth and rebirth."
 Please keep in mind that answering WHAT is different from answering HOW,
which is what I think you answer as prAna etc. To answer the question of
WHAT again, please see below a part of T.M.P Mahadevan's introduction to
the Panchadasi.

begin quote:
 The empirical individual is called jiva. the jiva is the non-dual Self
appearing in a limited or conditioned form on account of nescience
(avidyA). Being endowed with adjuncts such as egoity etc., it
transmigrates from one physical body into another, in accordance with its
karma.
end quote:

 in this respect, refer to verse 17, chap 1 of the panchadasi:
begin quote:
 but the other, the jiva, which is Brahman reflected in avidyA is
subjected  impure sattva. The avidyA is the causal body.
end quote:

 and also verse 30.

begin quote:
 they go from birth to birth, as worms that have slipped into a river are
swept from one whirlpool to another and never attain peace.
end quote:

 "sarira" itself means "perishable" and can be translated as body only
very loosely; so when you say "manifestation of sookshma sarira", how can
something persihable itself, be responsible for the migration of the jiva
from one perishable body to another?

you translate prAna as "vibration". May I ask of what? what is that
vibrates? I have seen prAna translated as "vital air", or as a reference
to one of the five sheaths which cover the jivA.

 To answer HOW, or in what manner is this appearance of the jiva to be
explained, there are principally two schools, the Vivarna and the
Bhamati. I think Sri Vidyashankar Sundaresan explained this a while ago
in this list, may be you can search the archives for that.

When you say:
> The Atman does not undergo this trans-migratory process since its there
> all the time but  is unrealized.

 yes you are right. but that does not mean that you do not have any idea
of it. It has indeed revealed itself to us, but in part; because only then
can even the desire to inquire about it can come. But the clear and
complete knowledge of it is lacking, and is due to avidya which is
beginningless.

as always, if I wrong, I hope knowledgeable listmembers will point it out.

Vaidya.

p.s:
:-)
 one reason for my beginning to use such things as begin quote and end
quote are a result of my complete immersion into latex, which I am using
for my thesis ...

                      Vaidya N. Sundaram
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The place, time, objects and their knower etc., projected in a dream
during sleep are all mithyA (an illusion/false). So too, here. in the
waking state, the world that is seen is a projection by one's own
ignorance. Likewise, this body, the senses, the breath, the ego etc.,
are all unreal. Therefore, That thou art, the peaceful, defectless,
supreme, non-dual Brahman.  -- Adi Shankara in VivekacUdAmani.
