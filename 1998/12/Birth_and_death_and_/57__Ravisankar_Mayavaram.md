A good description of sthUla (gross), sUkShma (subtle) and kAraNa
(causal)  sharira can be found in vivekachuuDaamaNi by shrI
shankara. There is an excellent commentary on this prakaraNa
grantha by shrI shrI chandrasekhara bhAratI (1892-1954) former
pontiff of sR^i~Ngeri shAradA maTha. Vaidya was posting the
bhAShyam on the list. I hope he will continue once his thesis is
done.
