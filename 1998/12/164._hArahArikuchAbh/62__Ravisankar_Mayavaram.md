164. hArahArikuchAbhogA

The term hAra means those attributes pertaining to hara
(parameshvara)  such as Ishvaratva, ApatkAmatva, nityatR^iptatva.
hAri means one which steals away the above attributes by creating
avidya which is their opposite.  HER kuchAbhoga ,i.e., chest
creats a desire for HER in paramesvara.  His mind then being
engrossed in that desire, will be subject to avidya caused by
HER.  Then his attributes of Isvaratva such as ApatkAmatva
controlling mAyA disappear.  This is because the attributes of
jIva (avidyA)  and those of Isvara (ApatkAmatva) cannot coexist.
HER chest creates a desire, in Ishvara, to seek pleasure outside
himself i.e., a desire to become many or to create the jagat.h.
The great attributes of HER chest which is the cause of the
jagat.h are suggested here.

Or this name can mean that HER chest is adorned with pearl
necklaces. It is a tradition to wear pearl necklaces in six
different ways depending on the occasion.
