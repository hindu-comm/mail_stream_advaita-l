Subject: Re: Intro

Greetings:

As is the tradition of this list - here is a brief intro:
My name is Subrahmanya.  I am an engineer by profession and
I have been interested in Advaita from an early age,
mainly because of my mother. At a young age, I had an
opportunity to  see the elder Swamiji, Sri Abinava Vidyathirtha
of Sringeri.
My interests earlier in Advaita were very historical,
and now over the years it has changed (I think...).
I have in the past looked up the archives and have learnt
quite a bit. The wish to subscribe came after some recent
conversations with a friend. Look forward to learning
more from all of you.

Subrahmanya.
