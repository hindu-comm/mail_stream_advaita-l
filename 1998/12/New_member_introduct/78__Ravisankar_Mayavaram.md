Subject: brief introduction for the advaita list

Hello everyone:
My name is Krishna Sridharan. I am a Masters student
in electrical engineering. I have been interested in
eastern philosophy since I was
young. Over the last few years my interests have
evolved into a keen
interest in advaita,vedanta and the bhakti marg.

Looking forward to joining the list

Krishna.
