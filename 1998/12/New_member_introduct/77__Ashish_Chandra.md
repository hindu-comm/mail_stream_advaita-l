Namaskar All,

I know that this has nothing to do with Advaita as propounded by Sri
Sankara, but I would really like to know the difference between Smartaas
and other sects of Sanatan Dharma. Are Smartaas those who worship Siva,
Visnu and Shakti ?

Thanks
Ashish

My introduction:

I was born into a Smartha brahmin family, and would like to learn more
about Advaita and would like to associate with other students of
Advaita.

Thanks & Best Regards,
Vivek S. Nittoor
