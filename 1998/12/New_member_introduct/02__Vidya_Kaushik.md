Namaste!
In addition to the nice explanation by Subhanu Saxena, I would add the
following.  VedAnta refers to the knowledge located at the end (anta) of
the VedAs namely the Upanishads which are other than the karma kAnda
portion of the VedAs.  The word VedAnta is a simple positional
identifier.  The nature of the knowledge presented in the VedAntic
scriptures deals with Atman and leads one to the truth which liberates.
