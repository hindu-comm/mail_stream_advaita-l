Namaskar Ravi,


My name is Ashish Chandra and I am a computer engineer working for AT&T. My
interest in not just Advaita, but Hinduism is fairly new and I credit Swami
Vivekananda's teachings for my interest. I look forward to learning more
about the modern day view people have about Advaita although it would be
good if people who have met Atmajnanis post their experiences.

I am thankful to you for doing this noble work and propounding Sanatan
Dharma.

Ashish Chandra
