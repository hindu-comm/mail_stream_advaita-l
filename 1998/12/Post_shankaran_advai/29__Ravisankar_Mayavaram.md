A good description of important advaitins after bhagavAn shrI
shankara can be found in

http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~vidya/advaita/later.html
and
http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~vidya/advaita/ad-today.html

shrI Vidyasakar's page provides a lot of information on different
topics related advaita-vedAnta.

To a great extent, the four AmnAya maTha-s and their branches are
responsible for teaching and preserving advaita-vedAnta. In the
20th century, institutions like Sri Ramakrishna Math has greatly
contributed to this movement by translating many works and making
them available to people at a very low cost.


Welcome to the list and hope we will learn and grow together.

With regards,
Ravi
