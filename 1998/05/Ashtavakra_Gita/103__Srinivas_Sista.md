The statements like "There is no being or non-being", ..etc
refer to the intellectual concepts of the mind. They are meant to
silence the mind and free it from all dualistic conceptions so
that the underlying non-dual nature is intuitively felt.
It is a well known fact that "being" cannot be negated.
