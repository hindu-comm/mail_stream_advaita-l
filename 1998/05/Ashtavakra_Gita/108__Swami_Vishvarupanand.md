Harih Om,

What I meant to say is, what was written in those stanzas you posted was
said by him as Jeevan mukta, not as a shadhaka. As a Jeevanmukta this is
what the rest of the life of the body is. As a sadhaka we have to follow
dharma, develop viveka, vairagya, shamadiguNa and mumukSutva. Of course in
the sense of surrendering one should accept whatever comes, pleasure or
pain. But as far as ones actions are concerned they should be marked by
viveka, vairaya and the rest.

Greetings and Om,
Vishvarupananda
