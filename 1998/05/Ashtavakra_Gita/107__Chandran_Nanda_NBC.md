At the Paramartika level it's said there's just One - just that - One.

When Janaka talks about trying to *achieving* inner freedom,
*experiencing* distress etc he surely is not talking from the
Paramartika standpoint? In the text it's explained how he suddenly
realizes his identity and his subsequent talk is definitely a
Paramartika talking. But isn't what he's talking about, the path he
followed? He cannot be saying that he attends to what presents itself to
be done, because he's *just* Realized his identity - so at that point of
time he's a *newly* Realized being who's not acted much.

But I agree on the dangers of following such a path. The path is not for
everybody, but for an extremely strong willed person who's already
learnt to discriminate between the Real and the transient and earnestly
desires liberation.
