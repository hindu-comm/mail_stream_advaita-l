One should keep in mind, that all this is said from Paramarthika state, not
vyavaharika. It is very dangerous to try to implement this on the
vyavaharika level, where it will lead to engaging in what the mind pleases
and the senses dictate. It is only in the paramartika-'state' that one can
abandon both renunciation and acquisition.
