Ok, I see your confusion. The "being" in the 2nd statement is NOT the
intellectual concept. The negation is at the intellectual level. Do you see!
I thought that the switch away from intellectual concepts was obvious.
I probably should have been explicit. The credence is given to the "being"
as it is and not its associated concept. You can only negate concepts.
You cannot negate that which "is".  Because the negation too "is".
That which "is" is "being". Hence, I was saying that "being" cannot be
negated.

Yes, since it is inherently non-characterizable, one is free to postulate
or refrain from postulating any theories about it.
He seems to be actually discarding all his prior conceptions, no doubt based
on different philosophical systems.
