AUM yogihR^itpadmabhAskarAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara at whose thought the heart of a yogi blooms like a
lotus which blossoms at the sight of Sun.  In the case of the lotus flower
the physical presence of Sun is required. But yogi's heart opens up with
joy at the mere thought of the name of the shrI  shankara. Such is His
greatness.
