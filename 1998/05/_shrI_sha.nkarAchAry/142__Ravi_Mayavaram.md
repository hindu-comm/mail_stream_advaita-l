AUM shArAdAhvAnapaNditAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara the great scholar who was invited by shrI
sarasvatI (bhAratI,  wife of maNDana mishra) for debate. He
defeated Her in the debate.

Finally even when ascending the sarvaj~na pITham, he silenced Her
protest by refuting her charge. shrI sarasvatI charged him saying that
he is not pure. shankara refuted the charge by saying that this
body cannot be held inmpure for the sins committed by the King's
body. She then remained silent and let him ascend the sarvaj~na pITham

AUM dharmAdharmavibhAvaj~nAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who knows the distinction between dharma and
adharma and who has an indepth understanding of it.
