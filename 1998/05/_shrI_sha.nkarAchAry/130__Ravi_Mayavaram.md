AUM parivrAjAshramoddhArtre namaH

(parivrAja Ashrama uddhArtA )

I bow to shrI shankara who re-organized and strengthened the sannyAsa
Ashrama.  The present dashanAmi sampradAyam is due to shrI shankara.

AUM sarvatantrasvantradhiye namaH

I bow to shrI shankara whose knowledge  is independent of the tantras.
He did not practice or study tantras to aquire the knowledge. The
Self shine not depending on others, but on its own accord. His
omniscience is due  to  AtmajnAnam.

AUM advaita-sthApanAchAryAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who firmly [re-]established the advaita
vedAnta. Adavaita guru parampara starts with shrIman nArAyana. But it
was shrI shankara who established it firmly through his bhAshyams on
upaniShads, bhagavad gIta and brahmasUtra, prakaraNa granthas and
through establishment of mAthas.


AUM sAkShAchCha.nkararUpabhrite namaH

(sAkshAt shankara rUpa bhrit)

I bow to shrI shankara who is indeed Lord shiva. shrI shankara is
considered by his disciples as none but the great Lord shiva himself.

The verse in toTakAShTakam

bhava eva bhava niti me nitaraM samajAyata chetasi kautikitA
mama vAraya moha mahAjaladhiM bhava shankara deshikame sharaNam.h

and the famous verse attributed to padmapAda which he realized and
uttered during the great debate between shrI vedavyAsa and shrI
shankara,

shankaraM shankarAchAryaM keshavam bAdarAyaNam.h
sUtrabhAShyakR^itau vande bhagavantau punaH punaH

indicate this.
