AUM atIndriyAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who has a more exalted stated than Indra. The name
Indra can also denote indriyAs or senses. Hence the name could mean one
who has conquered the senses or one who is above the sway of sense
pleasures.

This is something I'm not really clear about. It's said that the Rishis
saw the revelations. What does 'see' mean? Considering that the shruti
has been taught by the ear through the millinea one would think that the
first rishi was taught the same way by Srimath Narayana. But then,
shouldn't it be 'heard', rather than seen? But then shruti does mean,
"what's heard".

Again if as GMurthy states that these are the teachings of rishis who
have experienced the infinite bliss of Brahman, then aren't the Gita,
Yoga Vasishta and Ashtavakra Gita in the same class? Krishna, Vasishta,
Ashtavakra and Janaka are reowned jnanis, who too have experienced the
infinite bliss of Brahman. So why are these texts referred to as smritis
or what's remembered?
