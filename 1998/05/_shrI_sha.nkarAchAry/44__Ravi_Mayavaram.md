I am sorry for this mistake. It should read

AUM sarva loka hita utsukAya namaH

which the nAmvali form of sarvalokahitotsuka. This name comes in shrI
shankara aShTottara shata nAma stotram. I split the name and wrote it
so that it is understable of people like me who know very little
sanskrit.


Since my iShTa deivam is shrI mInAkShI (parAshaktI), I mostly use
mantras with feminine endings and by habit, I used it here as well.


with respects,
Ravi
