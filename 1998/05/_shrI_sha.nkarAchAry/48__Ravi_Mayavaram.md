AUM shrI sha.nkarAchAryavaryAya namaH

I bow to the noble and respectable shrI shankarAcharya. The word
"varya" is a modification of "Arya" (and it is closely related to the
tamil word aiyA)

AUM brahmAnandapradAyakAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who bestows the bliss of brahman to his
disciples by conferring AtmajnAnam.

AUM aj~nAnatimirAdityAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who dispels the aj~nAnam with brahmaj~nAnam
like the Sun's bright light rays dispels the darkness.

AUM suj~nAnAmbudhichandramAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who bestows the auspicious knowledge of brahman
to his disciples, like a a full moon showering its cool rays to a
large body of water.
