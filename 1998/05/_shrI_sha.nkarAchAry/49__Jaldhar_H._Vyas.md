The nourisher of the Brahmarakshasa?  Perhaps this refers to a story in
the Digvijayas that Gaudapadacharya had learned Vyakarana from Patanjali
but was cursed by him to beome a Brahmarakshasa.  The Brahmarakshasa would
trap a Brahman every day and ask him a question on grammar.  If the
hapless scholar failed to answer he was eaten.  This continued until one
day a certain Chandra Sharma answered the question freeing Gaudapadacharya
from the curse.  This Chandra Sharma went on to be Govindacharya and the
guru of Shankaracharya.

The only problem I see with this explanation is it would make
Govindacharya the Poshaka not Shankaracharya but I don't have a better
one.
