AUM vedavedAntatattvaj~nAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who knew the intricate and subtle philosophy of
vedas and upaniShads.  To Him the ocean of knowledge was a mere drop
of water which He could sip as easily as one sips water from one's
palm.

AUM durvAdimatakhaNDanAya namaH

I bow to shrI shankara who cut the arguments of avaidika philosphers
into pieces and eliminated nAstika systems.
