51. IDitA

SHE who is the object of praise.

The meaning of the root "ID" is praise. SHE is the object of
praise of vedAnta. It can mean that SHE is their goal. "eSha
nityo mahimA brahmaNasya" [bR^ihadAranyaka upaniShad
6-4-23] - the eternal greatness of the knower of brahman  is
neither enhanced by good deeds nor does it decrease by bad
deeds.
