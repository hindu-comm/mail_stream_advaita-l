 I am sorry for making a misleading statement here. The correspondence
 between the three states and prAjna, taijasa, and vishva, is as
 follows:

  prAjna  <-> (dreamless) sleep (suShupti)
  taijasa <-> dream (svapna)
  vishva  <-> waking (jAgrat)

 The correspondence with Ishvara, etc. is correct as I stated before.

 prAjna <-> Ishvara
 taijasa <-> HiraNyagarbha
 vishva  <-> VirAT

 Anand
