45. IshvaratvavidAyinI

SHE who confers the attitude of oneness with Ishvara.

"svena svarUpena niShpadyate" [chandogya upaniShad 3.4] - Culminates
as HER own Self. Ignorance possesses the power of limitation and
extension. It creates the misconception that one's Self and Ishvara
are different. SHE who is the infinite Awareness destroys that
ignorance, and confers the attitude of oneness with Ishvara.

"Ishvaratva" denotes the one's authority in dominions of learning and
wealth. SHE confers these based on one's past good deeds.
