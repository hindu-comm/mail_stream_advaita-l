What is the source of this statement?

There are lots of doubts about the exact geographical locations during
Shankara's times. Even the birthplace of Shankara can be debated.
Totakacharya, one of the direct disciples of Shankara, and the first
pontiff of the Badrinath Math, mentions that Shankara was born in
Chidambaram in Tamilnadu. The other references say it is Kaladi in
Kerala. Given that even Shankara's birthplace is vague, I'd doubt any
reference to the disciple of Shankara being the Rajaguru in Cambodia.

When my father returned from Germany after his PhD, his Guru would not
accept him as a disciple. It is not that Guruji specifically refused to
allow him back as a disciple, but that as a general rule, it was known
that he did not accept someone who had travelled abroad. Later, he
happenned to see my father somewhere and said that he had "relaxed this
rule." Crossing the seas does seem to have had some connotations of
"unholiness."

My question can still be paraphrased: Dvijas alone are eligible to chant
the Gayatri Mantra. Why?

OK.

It is easy to see from Shankara's BSB that,"... Moxa can follow only
from a previous study of the Vedic texts."

Which implies that not just anyone, but only one who is or has been a
Dvija in a previous life can acquire GYAna. This is a fundamental
requirement that Shankara explicitly lays out in his Brahma Sutra
Bhashya.
