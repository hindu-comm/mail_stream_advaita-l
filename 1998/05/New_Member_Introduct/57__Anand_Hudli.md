 Let us heartily welcome Dr. Grimes to this list! We will surely
 benefit from the participation of such distinguished scholars. I
 have read the book on Ganapati by him and would like to congratulate
 him for an excellently written book that introduces the many aspects
 of Ganesha to the English speaking people of the world.

 I also look forward to discussions on his other works, especially
 those on the naiShkarmya-siddhi and the vivekachUDAmaNi, and
 of course, his scholarly participation in the discussions on many
 other topics that have been and will be discussed here.

 I feel the list is indeed fortunate to have subscribers like
 Dr. Grimes.

 AUM mahAgaNapataye namaH
