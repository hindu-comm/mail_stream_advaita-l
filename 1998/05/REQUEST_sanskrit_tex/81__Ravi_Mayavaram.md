As Giri pointed out, there's never any mention of what the
state itself is like.  Mainly because descriptions are not
only impossible but irrelevant!  The idea of "experience"
itself is irrelevant.  As is the idea of a "subject" having
an "experience."   These are relative concepts, part and
parcel of the dancing snake arising out of the ether of Mind.
Stop this Mind, or at least hold it at bay, and what's been
ever in your midst will be revealed.  This is the Substratum.
Now, the totality of what is, is the attributeless Substratum
(nirguna brahman) in conjunction with Its shakti projection or
Mind (saguna brahman).  Thus when both are wholeheartedly
embraced, the Mind's activity gets "neutralized" by the
unfathomable Substratum.  That is, the ego [supporting the
Mind] is in fact no longer in existence as ego (defined as
a separative, exclusive entity), but is rather existentially
absorbed, as it were, into its source and lone reality:
the *unchanging* Self.  Thus It is ever in our midst and
needs no logical proof of Its existence since It is Existence
Itself!  This is why It's referred to as sat-chit-ananda.

namaste.
