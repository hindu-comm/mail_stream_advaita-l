 The complete works of Sankaracharya by Samata books has the trishatI-
 bhAShya in the same volume as the ViShNu-sahasra-nAma bhAShya. I
 can't remember the volume number, but I think the title of the
 volume is "laghubhAShya's."

  Vidyasankar's page has a fairly extensive bibliography on advaita
  works.

 PS: In light of your comment that Vidya is moving/has moved, I hope
 the advaita homepage will stay as is or will find a new home too.
