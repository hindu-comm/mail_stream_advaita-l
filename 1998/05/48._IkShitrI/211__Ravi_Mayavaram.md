48. IkShitrI

SHE who is the impartial witness.  SHE as a witness is uninvolved  in
the actions and SHE is like a passive spectator. svetAshvatara
upaniShad call this 'sAkShI chetA" - conscious witness. SHE as the
presiding awareness of everything, witness them all. "AviH sannihitaM
guhyAM" [muNDakopaniShad 2.2] which is brahman is very near in the
heart cave.  Hence SHE is IkShitrI

AUM Ikshitryai namaH
