 Tomorrow (5/8/1998), VaishAkha-shukla-chaturdashI, marks the day
 when Lord ViShNu appeared as the nR^isimha (half-man half-lion)
 incarnation.

 The day when the Bhagavan nR^isimha's jayantI is to be celebrated
 is stated as follows, in the nR^isimha purANa:

  vaishAkhe shukla-paxe tu chaturdashyAM nishAmukhe |
  majjanmasaMbhavaM puNyaM vrataM pApapraNAshanaM   |
  varShe varShe tu kartavyaM mama santuShTikAraNaM  ||

  (shrI-nR^isimha said:) One should observe My appearance on the
  14th tithi (lunar day) of the bright half of the lunar month of
  vaishAkha, during the beginning of the night (evening twilight).
  This meritorious observance destroys all sin, and should be done
  every year for My pleasure.

  This year, the chaturdashI tithi extends from about 5:15 AM Eastern
  Daylight Time (EDT), Saturday the 9th to about 7:30 AM EDT, Sunday
  the 10th. Therefore, during the twilight period (technically the
  pradoSha period) of the 9th, the chaturdashI (14th tithi) prevails.
  The 9th should then be celebrated as shrI-nR^isimha jayantI in
  North America.

  One more factor this year is that the svAtI-naxatra, which was
 prevalent when nR^isimha appeared from the pillar, also prevails
 from about 6:15 PM EDT on the 9th and extends throughout the night.

 Shankara has composed a most beautiful hymn called the lakShmI-
 nR^isimha-karAvalaMbaM.

     andhasya me hR^itavivekamahaadhanasya
   choraiH prabho balibhirindriyanaamadheyaiH |
   mohaandhakuupakuhare vinipaatitasya
   lakshhmInR^isiMha mama dehi karAvalambam.h  || 11 ||

   O Lord!  My great wealth called power of discrimination (viveka)
   has been  stolen away by the powerful thieves called senses.
   I am blind (without the power of discrimination between things
   eternal and noneternal). In this condition, I have been pushed into
   the dark well called delusion. O Lakshminrsimha, provide me the
   support of Your hands.
                          (lakShmI-nR^isimha-karAvalaMbaM)

 Shankara has composed a most beautiful hymn called the lakShmI-
 nR^isimha-karAvalaMbaM.  I had translated this hymn sometime back on
 the vaishnava newsgroup. Some verses of the hymn were posted on
 this list last year. Please see:

I am working on that.

I admit I had to laugh at this one :-). However, there is quite a record
of brahmins misbehaving. I can write about this to you if you wish. I
pointed that out only to make my point that just being born a brahmin
does not mean anything.

According to smR^iti-s brahmaNa-s are not supposed to take up any
profession to earn money. The only money they can obtain is from
contributions of others. Some handwaving statements that professions can
be taken up in kali yuga are given, but seems only wishful thinking to
me. These seem to be much later ideas. I presume from your web-page
(which I saw about a year back, so sorry if I am mistaken again) that
you write software for a living. It's certainly not a profession you can
take up and claim to be following dharma.

Someone insisting that the earth is flat because of their world view is
also OK then?

If you do not I apologize. But, I seem to remember you saying that
non-Indians cannot obtain moxa?!

When did I deny that? I was _only_ referring to the moxa part.

___ excerpt from original message
body is to be born as a male member of the priestly caste." How
un-vedantic
and tragic that the orthodox have, in a parrot-like fashion, blindly and
dogmatically declared that the mere act of a male birth in a brahmin
family
is an indispensable prerequisite for Self-realization! Commentators,
scholars, and apologists have gone to great lengths in an attempt to
justify this interpretation. To mention but a few: Women are (declared
to
be) not fit to realize the Self because of their involvement in:
domestic
duties, child-bearing, child-rearing, and/or sense-pleasures; rulers and
warriors (ksatriya), business people (vaisya), and laborers (shudra) are
unfit to realize the Self because their activities are directed
outwards;
______________

Your posting followed this and naturally I assumed that you were
contradicting this. I did not remember the verses which Ravi pointed
out. I realize now that because of this the interpretation given is more
indirect and also realize why you jumped on the vedAdhikAra issue. I
apologize for the harsh words. But, as Sadananda pointed out, these can
also be interpreted in this sense without granting vedAdhikara to
everyone.

> Or college professors or Internet posters :-)

True.

Rama.
