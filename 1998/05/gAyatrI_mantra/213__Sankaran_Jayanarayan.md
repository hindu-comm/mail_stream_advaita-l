Yes.

But I had a different question in mind. I was told that some pujas like
the Panchayatana puja (to Ganesha, Vishnu, Shiva and other deities) have
*ill effects* associated with them if performed in the wrong manner
(surrender to the Lord notwithstanding). In a similar way, the Gayatri
Mantra is held "sacred" or "holy" by the advaita tradition and comes
with a set of instructions on who can chant it, when and where it ought
to be chanted and so on. I wanted to know if we are allowed to chant it
in the USA.

I believe Ramana Maharshi has also said that it is possible that the
instruction of a Mantra by someone other than a qualified Guru may not
have the right effect. He gave the analogy of a king and an ordinary man
issuing the same order. The king's word carries more weight.

I too have felt the same in the USA. But it is difficult to know whether
or not this feeling represents spiritual progress. As Ramana Maharshi
says, it is very difficult to know the extent of one's spiritual
progress.
