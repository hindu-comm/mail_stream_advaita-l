I think discussion pertains to, not who decides, but who is qualified for
moksha - The qualifications are extensively discussed by Shankara in Tatva
bodha and VivekachuuDaamaNi - as the four fold qualifications - Viveka,
Vairaagya, Shatsampati and Mumukshutvam - and what each means is also
discussed extensively. These are essential considering the nature of the
moksha.  These qualifications is not intended to evaluate others, since
they are qualifications pertaining to ones metal makeup.  They are provided
as milestones for ones own growth. If I am not realized, I do not have what
it requires - helps a sadhak to proceed in the right direction.

Yes it is Ishvara's prerogative but one has earn it! - Hence Sadhana is
essential to qualify for Ishvara's grace! - To look even better - Iswara's
grace is always there if one can tap it! Krishna says- Ch. 9-

I am equanimous for all living beings, neither I hate any one nor I love
(favor)  any one..
But those who worship me with full devotion I am with them they are with me.

To be devoted to that and that alone requires the four fold qualifications.
These are the only qualifications - not kula, gothra, varna, and linga.
They are neither necessory nor sufficient.  Having said all that, having
the right opportunities would help if one can make use of the opportunities
given.

It will mean something only if one can make use of it.

No disagreements in any of these. How true is the last statement!
Sometimes our own prejudices and our bigetry prevent us from understanding
the true import of
scriptures too!

Hari Om!
