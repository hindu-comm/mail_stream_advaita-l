52. IshvarArdhA.ngasharIrA

SHE who has half of the body of Lord shiva.

"Ishvara" means "shiva" who is sat-chit-Ananda. Half of His
body is a form of Ananda. SHE has bliss as HER shariram or
distinguishing form. "sachchinmayaH shivaH sAkShat
tasyAnandamayI shivA"  - which means shiva is sat-chid and
shivA is Ananda.

This name also means that the paradevata is worshipped using
the bIja hR^iM. In the panchadashI ha and ka are shiva
bIjas, hR^iM is both shiva and shaktI bIja and rest are all
shaktI bIjAs (*). This is explained in the uttara bhAga of
the trishatI stotram

(etat.h vij~nAna matrena shrIvidyA siddhidA bhavet.h |
 katrayaM hadvayaM chaiva shivo bhAgaH prakIrtitaH ||

 Only by knowing this secret one will really know the
 shrIvidyA. The three "ka" and two "ha" are shiva akSharas.

 evaM vibhAga-maj~nAtva shrIvidyA japa shAlinaH |

hR^IMkara is both shaktI and shiva akSharam. And rest all
are shaktI akSharas. Only by knowing this one really knows
shrI vidyA. Without this knowledge if one practices the
shrIvidyA it will not be fruitful even after 100 crore
kalpAs of practice. )

will be described in detail.
