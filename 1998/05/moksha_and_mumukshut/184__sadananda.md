Mumukshu is defined as moksham ikshasu yasya saH - mumukshu - the one who
has the desire for liberation is mumukshu - the one who has the desire for
liberation is the one who thinks he is bound and therefore has the desire
to get unbound. The question of who is that that has the desire - this
question can get muddled if one keeps shifting the reference from Jeeva to
Brahman. Changing the reference without recognizing it, is the major
problem in lot of these questions.  Obvously from Brahman point there is no
question of the desire for liberation.  From Jeeva's point there is, since
he thinks he is a jeeva.  The desire is in the mind of jeeva who obviously
thinks he is the mind - Notion that I am a Jeeva goes with the notion that
I am the mind. And notions are entertained only in the mind!  Hence it is
said:

        manayeva manushyaanaam karaNAM bhandamokshayoH|
        bandhaaya vishayaaskatam muktyainirvishayam sRitam||

Mind is the root cause for both bondage and liberation. Longing for the
sense objects (for ones happiness) is the bondage and the liberation is
freedom from that notion that happiness is out there - all are in the mind!
- Obviously the freedom from that notion that happyness is not out there,
comes only with the realization of that I am - Satyam JNaanam Anantam -
Brahman

Hari Om!

>> Namaste.
>>
>> mumukshu has been described as one having a burning desire for liberation.
>> But I see a subtle contradiction in the description.
>>
>> Liberation for what ? What is the entity seeking liberation ? My
>> answer to that is: It is the body-mind-intellect complex that is
>> seeking liberation for itself. That means, mumukshu is already
>> identified with the body-mind-intellect complex and is seeking
>> salvation for that entity. Of course, the mumukshu realizes,
>> with enlightenment, that it is not salvation for that body-
>> -mind-intellect complex but it is salvation *from* that
>> thinking of individuality.
>>
>> Why do "I" care what happens to this body-mind-intellect complex ?
>> It is just like a snake on the rope.
>>
>> That is, the so-called "burning desire for liberation" would or should
>> wane as the individual jeeva becomes disocciated with this body-mind
>> complex and realizes the true Self.
