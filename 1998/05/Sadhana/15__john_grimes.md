If I am not mistaken, viprataa comes from >vip "to tremble, shake, shiver,
vibrate, quiver, be stirred and thus > vipra "stirred, excited inwardly,
inspired, wise, learned, sage, seer, singer, poet, brahmin, priest etc"

I will try to share some of the verses with my commentary/notes as and when
it seems appropriate. The work is almost completed (this summer if all goes
well) and then it will look for a publisher. I don't see why not I can't
share it (unless someone knows otherwise).
