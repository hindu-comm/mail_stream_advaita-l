Vedanta is a system based on textual exegesis not experience so in that
way it is not any different from the scholasticism of Christianity,
Judaism, or Islam.   I don't think that's a bad thing but there is no
reason to think it couldn't  have been used or misused.  Indians are no
beter or worse than anyone else.
