To give but one more perspective on this matter, Vedantins oft-quote the
verse, "Sruti, Yukti, Anubhava" = first one hears the liberating truth;
then one reflects upon it; finally one experiences it." Always, always, the
final word in Vedanta is personal experience. As a philosophical system
Vedanta may be concerned with textual exegesis. As a description of
what-is, it is an experience. To reveal the Self is the be-all and end-all
of Advaita. This experience, Advaita further claims, is within the reach of
all. The same method does not suit everyone. The average person can have no
knowledge of the particular combination of factors that is necessary to
bring to completion the hitherto neglected factors of one's being. Thus, it
is not really theory that Advaita advocates, so much as experience.
"Philosophy is not his (Shankara's) aim but is rather a vital weapon with
which to fulfill this aim, which is to rescue people out of transmigratory
existence."
