But the text he claims to be translating most emphatically does touch on
this subject.  And what was all that stuff about viprata and female rishis
in aid of then?

And it is more difficult to be born a mere Brahman  (call me a pedant if
you will but I don't wish to perpetuate a silly English mispronounciation.)
than it is to be born another type of human being which is harder than
being born a lesser creature and so on.  The point is the text establishes
a definite hierarchy which it seems to me Prof. Grimes seems to me to be
uncomfortable with.  Which in this case makes for a bad translation.

So I wonder why the jagadgurus are always Brahmans and some of the
Dashanami orders only accept Brahmans as members?

Hmm... for the past couple of hundred years the Vyas's have been teachers
and petty bureaucrats.  About the most atrocious thing they ever did was
to fail someone in algebra.  If something in _your_ past troubles your
conscience that's your problem.  Mine's clear.

Uh I don't think so.  Care to justify those remarks.

It means that the people who made those arguments were not "blindly
dogmatically parroting" as the good doctor put it.  Their reasoning is a
natural outcome of their worldview.

And I think I made it clear this is _one_ of _several_ views on the
subject that can be called "orthodox".  I didn't actually come out and say
this is the view I prefered.  (the answer to that question can be found in
the archives if you care to look.)  If you wish to make any progress you
need to learn a little objectivity.

This by the way settles the adhikara question.

This is another orthodox view unrelated to any point I'm trying to make.

Or college professors or Internet posters :-)

On the contrary as Dr. Grimes also acknowledges the meaning of the shloka
I am defending is the traditional one.

It's for the best.  You didn't really understanding.

So who's telling him to stop posting?  I'm telling him to translate
better!
