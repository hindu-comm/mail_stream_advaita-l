Referring back to the text I have,  the meditation slokas are from verse
254 to 263 ( the number may differ from book to book) and the above sloka
is the very first in this group - sloka no. 254 - except for my typo - the
last line should read as: brahmatatwamasi bhaavayaatmani - extension of tat
twam asi - The last line is repeated in each of the 10 slokas.

Regarding the versus 2 and 3: At that time and society environment there is
no doubt that it was definitely a blessing for a Jigyasu-s to be born with
the required educational opportunities particularly when they were limited
or restricted to a chosen few. In a way, it was the merit of previous lives
to have born in a environment conducive for such a study.  In that sense
Shankara was on the mark.

May be Shankara would have written differently if is he is here now after
examining the new reservation systems for education.  -That is an academic
question and I have no intention of discussing the issues beyond the point.

The point is birth is product of the past actions, and in Vedanta there are
no accidents but only incidents and the right environment is provided for
ones growth.  The environment is only the product of the past and there is
purushaartha in the present, and future prarabda is the past modified by
the present action.

I like to know  etymological origin for the word Viprata - one can extract
more deeper meaning beyond its direct meaning.

I enjoyed reading John Grimes exhaustive explanation of the
VivekachuuDamaNi verse.  If it does not infringe the copy rights, I wonder
if he can (atleast selectively) discuss the versus with his commentary for
the group.

Hari Om!
