Because samadhi discloses something that is immediately
recognized to have been there all along.  It's a new way
of looking at what has been within one's midst all along!
It's best referred to as atmabhavana, the unchanging feeling
that is the Self Being.  This [everpresent Being-ness] doesn't
have to be explained to anyone, including an infant.  It's
the only criteria that can be truly self-evident, no?  hahaha!
No pun intended!

namaste.
