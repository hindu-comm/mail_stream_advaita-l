namaskAram Ramakrishnan

But does not original the verses refer to the vedAdhikAram.

Take verse 2, It follows vipratA with vaidika-dharma-mArga paratA. Not
just being born as brahmin, following vaidika dharma mArga is even
superior and more difficult to do. And in verse 4, what does the term
shrutipAra darshanam refer to.  Please correct me if I am wrong.


I agree with you that one need be a brahmin to attain mokSham, and not
even a human (take gajendra moksham as example).


With respects,
Ravi
