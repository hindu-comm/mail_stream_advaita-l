I believe that human body is precious because of the spinal shrines
(chakras), at least from the point of view of kuNDalini yoga. Ignoring
spiritual side, the reasons you have given will be true to many other
animal species too.


Thanks for your insights into the words pauruSham and viprata. Even in
this day, I beleive, being born in a brahmin family is a great
advantage. One will atleast get to know many things about Atmajnanam
at a very young age. Plus one (being a male) can get a chance for
upananyanam initiation and doing sandhya. Ignoring shudras, I dont
think other two varnas, who are eligible for sandhya worship, do that
these days.

Of course, I should add that, many mUDhAtmas like me, throw away all
these God given advantages and seek trivial things like certificates
and money. As shankara says, it is like a suicide.

Please correct me if I am wrong. There is nothing better than an
opprtunity to learn.

With respects,
Ravi
