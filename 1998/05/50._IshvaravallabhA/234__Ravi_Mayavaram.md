50. IshvaravallabhA

SHE who is the beloved of kAmeshvara.

SHE has kAmeshvara as HER husband and SHE is dear to Him

This name can be interpreted in another way. "Ishvara" here denotes
brahma, viShNu and shiva. SHE is their inner principle and power. They
owe their greatness to HER.  SHE is very dear to them.

AUM IshvaravallabhAyai namaH
