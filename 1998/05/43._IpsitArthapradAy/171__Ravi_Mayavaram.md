43. IpsitArthapradAyinI

SHE who gives the desired objects to devotees. "Ipsita" means desire
and "artha" means object. These are benefits which can be enjoyed here
and mokSha hereafter. "pradAyini" means SHE gives all these.

mImAmskAH think that deeds that are done now alone bears fruits
through adR^iShTa. This is not correct. Why? adR^iShTa is inanimate
and not to have known any powers to award fruits. For instance,
a king who is pleased with the deeds of his servant gives him rewards.
The deeds done are rewarded only because there is a presiding
Awareness. parameshvara is karmAdyakShaH. He presides all the
actions.  HE is omniscient and potent to suitably reward thegood and
bad deeds. Even other conscious agents like jIva do not have that
power. HE alone creates proper desires in those who are competent to
do them, HE induces them properly to effort and fulfills their
desires. This argument refutes the point of view of atheistic
mImAmsakAH.

This name can be interpreted in another way. "Ipsita" means
comprehended. The term "IpsitArtha" denotes the object desired to be
attained by prayer, by shravaNa (hearing), by manana (comtemplating)
and by nidishyAsa (meditation). This object is mokSha. SHE gives this.
That is to say SHE gives HERSELF.
