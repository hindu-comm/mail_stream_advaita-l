I was busy, so I could not type the meaning for this beautiful kuRaL.
In this the great sage tiruvaLLuvar emphasizes on the devotion to
lord.

Tamil word "paRRu" (pronounced like patru)  means seek,
bondage, and attachment (depending on the context.

pARRuga    seek
paRRaRRAn  One who has no bondage (that is Ishvara). This term will
           split as paRRu + aRRAn

paRRinai       bondage (bond yourself to  God)


appARRinai      That bondage you sought  (is for)

paRRa viDaRku   getting rid of all other bondages.

Seek and bond yourself with the One who has no bondage, do so to
get rid of all other desires and bondages.

Naturally a question will arise whether or not seeking Ishvara will
lead to another bondage. Answer is no. That is what kAnchi periyavar
explained  through a beautiful example (which giri quoted).
