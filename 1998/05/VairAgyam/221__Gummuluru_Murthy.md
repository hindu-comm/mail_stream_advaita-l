Namaskarams.

There are 40 qualities set by Shri Shankara for a sincere vedAntic
student (in SAdhanA panchakam). I do not know of any pre-conditions
for vairAgya, like one has to be materialistically poor, or should be
suffering from diseases etc. I cannot see such pre-conditions.

VairAgya, as you say is by divine grace (as everything is), is a mental
state where you develop dis-passion for what the sense organs grasp from
this world. This leads to behaviour of audAseenya (indifference) not only
to matters that are not of interest but also to matters what the world
and the society say you are to have an interest. This leads to equanimity
- same balanced attitude for "pleasures" and "sorrows" . This leads to
knowledge "Brahmah satyam jagan mithyah, jeevo brahmaiva nah parah" -
only Brahman is Real, the jagat is mithyah and - rejection of the unreal;
- which is renunciation. You see yourself to be Brahman and enjoy the
bliss.
