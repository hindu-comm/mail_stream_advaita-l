Namaste.

With all respect to Shri Nanda Chandran's invitation for a debate on the
topic (the supremacy or otherwise of the vedas), I must decline.

1. Firstly, that will be an intellectual debate to satisfy the intellect.
What I am seeking in advaita is not intellectual satisfaction, but am
looking for something beyond what the intellect can understand and
rationalize.

2. Shri Shankara and the other great acaryas have stated this (supremacy
of the vedas) in their writings. My intellect accepts their statements
without any reservation and with greatest reverence.

3. This (supremacy of the vedas) has been discussed from time immemorial
and we can not make any new points at this stage.

4. That (supremacy of the vedas) is not to say that there is not much
to learn from the smritis. There is certainly, a lot. However, vedas
(and upanishhads) are unique in the knowledge that they are, being the
sayings of the R^shhis that experienced the infinite bliss of Brahman,
and who, for the sake of others, have passed on their oral teachings.

5. There are other scholars on this list who are much more learned
(than me) in shruti and smriti who may make telling points one way
or other on this topic.

Having said all that, I will, over the next few weeks, put together
an article compiling the sayings on this topic in the literature
with adequate references. Because, I can only convey what the
great scholars of the past have already said.

I admire your faith, I wish I had such faith.

Yes, indeed. The pUrva mImA.nsaka-s have talked about it extensively.

The veda-s are not the compositions of anyone. They are "seen" by the
R^ishhi-s. And many of the stuff found in the veda-s cannot be obtained
by reasoning or pratyaxa. This does not refer only to the knowledge of
brahman, but even in more mundane matters, like performance of yAga-s
etc.
