Namaste.

I was hoping that some of the more technically knowledgeable members
of the list will answer the above query in response to my earlier
post. In the absence of anyone coming forward, let me venture a
response, however incorrect or incomplete it might be. This is my
understanding.

Technically, there is no mind in a physical sense. It is not a
human organ. It is the flow of thoughts through this human
entity. The type of thoughts that go through depends on one's
viveka, that discriminating sense (which says what is right and
what is wrong and what is one's dharma) which is the result of
innumerable lives which the jeeva takes.

The sanskrit words which describe this are: for the mind, the
manas or antah-karaNa; and for intellect the buddhi or viveka.

SanatkumarA's teachings to NArada in Chandogya upanishhad and
Shri Shankara's bhAshhya on this deal with this topic. I cannot
say I understood it fully, but I am trying to.

Shri Swami ChinmayAnandA's book Self Unfoldment also deals with
the topic of the mind and puts it in a nice perspective.
