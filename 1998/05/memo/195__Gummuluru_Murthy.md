Namaste.

But, in the sahaja state (I take it that you mean by sahaja state, our
natural state where we are not covered by mAyA but are the Atman in our
natural glow), does the mind exist ? And, even if it exists,
what burden could it be, or what obstacles or mischief can it produce,
or what expenditure of "energy" is there to overcome ? In the sahaja
state, I am nirguna Brahman, and I pervade all and I know it. In that
state, what botheration can the mind be ? What Shri Sadananda says above
about the mind is with reference to the mAyAvic state of the jeeva.

I do not want to belabour the point, because there is no disagreement
really, except a slight difference in emphasis.

If I can put a not too perfect an analogy: let us imagine a truck full
of incriminating evidence is caught. The reaction is: the truck and the
truck driver is the culprit, but the one who instigated the crime (the
mafia that organized the crime) is still at large, and that is the one
we have to catch, not the poor truck. In this analogy, I equate the
truck with incriminating evidence to the mind with the thoughts going
through; the mafia behind the crime to the viveka of the human that
allows the (bad) thoughts to go through; we should look for that real
culprit, our own viveka.
