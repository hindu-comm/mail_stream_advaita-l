Namaste.

Although I see the point that is being made, with which I concur, but
why blame the poor "mind" ? It is true that the mind is the originator
or conduit for thoughts that go through this body-mind-intellect complex,
but they may just as well be good thoughts. Rg veda says "Let noble
thoughts come to us from all sides".

It is the viveka, that discriminator that lets the single worst thought
"desire", however small, to go through. And that, in my view, is the one
that runs havoc in this body-mind-intellect complex and hampers whatever
chance we have of going beyond the body-mind-intellect and realizing our
true Self. My favorite Viveka ChuDAmaNi verse (# 424) says in part
"... the culmination of dispassion (vairAgya) is the desirelessness...".
