The Mind is the only thing within the field of our consciousness
that can possibly bring us, at least *apparently*, out of our natural
state [of the Self].   Otherwise we are perpetually That.   Nay,
*despite* it, we are perpetually That!   For, is there another Reality?
Therefore, what Mind?

Consider the implications of this.
