     I concur!

     But, of course, there's no one really "here"
                       to be doing the "concurring"
                                  and there's no one really "there"
                                           who is being "concurred with.


                       With Blessings,

                             One-who-only-pretends-to-be-the-subject-of-the
sentence, "I concur."
