But than with what do *we* exercise our viveka? - the mind.

Am I'm mistaken in aligning the sense of discrimination with the mind?
But wouldn't it make more sense to actually consider the whole
contraption as the mind and the rest as it's various functions ie 1.
Ego, 2. The faculty of reasoning - the intellect, 3. Mind Stuff -
thoughts and 4. the Memory.
