Namaste. Please correct me if I am wrong in the following:

I see only two states.

The jeeva state, or the state of ignorance, and

The nirguNa state, the state of jnAna.

The jeeva state includes the saguNa state mentioned above. In the state of
ignorance, jeeva sees creation, and with jeeva incapable of creation,
invokes Ishwara, the creator. But jeeva can never be the creator, and
hence, can the saguNa state have the status of a state ? However, it is
an important sub-state which allows us (i) to see the limitations of the
jeeva, and (ii) to surrrender the ego with humility to a superior power.

In that way, I take bhagavad-gita, not as a narration by Lord Krishna
(Ishwara) to his disciple Arjuna, but as a discussion that goes on within
any individual between the consciousness (Krishna) and the ego (Arjuna).
I realize I am opening Pandora's box with this, but is that thinking
invalid ?
