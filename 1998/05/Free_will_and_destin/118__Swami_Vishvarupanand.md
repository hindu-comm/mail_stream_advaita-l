Imo the accuracy of the nadi predictions is because they are not based
merely on astrology, but were written down by seers. To them time does not
exist, and when they see, the see not only what will come our way, but they
also see, how our free will lead us to act. I'm still of the oppinion, if
you read those leaves and see that what you are going to do will be a
mistake you can decide to do it otherwise. It may require a good amount of
will-power, though.

Om Vishvarupananda
