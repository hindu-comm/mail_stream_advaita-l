^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No. Not by any flight of imagination :-) I was only pointing out that
according to the philosophy of Descartes, the self cannot be an illusion
(since it is beyond all doubt), and the derivation of this fact is, of
course, is non-advaitic.

I believe the word is "svayaMjyoti"

                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is not correct, IMHO. Why would the existence of tha Atman need
illustration, if it is already self-revealed? There would be no reason
to point out the existence of an object already known.

IMHO, the existence of the Atman is known, but the *nature* of the Atman
is unknown.

And there are rules about learning the Upanishads *only* by oral
instruction (hence the name "shruti," that which is heard). I myself
have observed several members quoting vedic mantras directly from books.
In this light, I don't think it necessary to place the restriction on
the BSB (on this list), though I fully believe it to be true.
