When Descartes said,"I think, therefore I am," he didnot mean that his
thoughts caused the self. He logically concluded that the Self exists
since the statement "I doubt" itself cannot be doubted. For if it is
doubted, the statement still remains.

The best book on advaita is undoubtedly Shankara's commentary on the
Brahma Sutras. It can be said without any hesitation whatsoever that
this is THE book for learning about advaita. It is virtually impossible
to find a book of greater clarity in exposition. Last but certainly not
the least, the importance of this work has been stressed by one of the
greatest pontiffs of Sringeri: Vidyaranya himself, who declares that
this is the greatest book ever written!

I never said that Descartes said thoughts caused the self. And you are
reading advaita into Descartes. Descartes' philosophy is hardly monistic
by any stretch of imagination. Even interpreted as you say, it's not the
view of advaita. Atman is self-established and requires NO proof. This
is the view of advaita. The anvaya-vyatireka is to deny only external
objects. The continuous existence of a "seer" is a concept which itself
arises in avidyA and helpful in illustrating the existence of Atman.
This point is made clear by shrI sureshvara.

Different teachers suggest different texts. shruti itself says
mANDUkyamekam kevalam. The text depends on the student also, there is no
one glove fits all in this situation. I have posted HH abhinava
vidyAtIrtha mahAsvAmigaLs expression of this before.

Further the BSB is to be studied _only_ under a guru (as per HH). Others
should read prakaraNa grantha-s if studying by oneself.

Rama.
