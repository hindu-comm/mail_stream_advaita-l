sarvebhyo namaH,
  I'm sorry I do not have the time to get involved in any discussions,
but I feel that I should post the definition of adhikaaraH:

Superintendence, watching over; post of authority; administration of
pecuniary matters; sovereignty, government or administration,
jurisdiction; rule; seat of government or jurisdiction; a head or
governing rule, which exerts a directing or governing influence over
other rules; possessed of authority, invested with office; qualification
or authority to perform certain specified duties (civil, sacrificial,
religious - as the adhikaara of a king to rule and protect, of a
BrahmaNa to sacrifice, etc.), etc.

dhanyavaadaH,
  Mantralaura
