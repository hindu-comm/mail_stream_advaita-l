   Sir, I fully agree with you.  I was merely stating the commonly
held view.  IMHO, the notion that the study of the vedas should be
restricted to male DvijAs and Brahmins at that, is a conservative one
at best.  The primacy of the Vedas in Vedanta is unquestionable.  As
ShrI Giridhar had opined, the import of the Vedas can be obtained from
Smriti.  But, for a  more serious study, the primary source of
knowledge ( Shruti ) would have to be consulted ( IMO ).  So, to
restrict scriptural study is to restrict a full and complete
experience of Vedanta.
   Before, I claim credence to my New Age liberalism, I am fully aware
of the Orthodox VedAdhikAram views.  IMHO, these restrictions are
there to ensure that people have the necessary pre-requisite qualities
before they commence Scriptural Study.  But, the crux of this debate
is "who is a brahmin?".  "Brahmin" to ShrI Shankaracharya meant
something vey different than what it means today.  I have trouble
accepting that the BhagavatpAda had somehow ( implicitly and/or
explicitly ) espoused the degenerate caste system of today.
   I would be very grateful if the learned members of this forum shed
more light on this issue.

Thanks,

-Vivek.
