   I agree that my knowledge is limited and I meant no disrespect to
any one in particular by my previous post.  The "Degeneration"
mentioned above is the understanding of the system as it stands today
( atleast as it was explained to me ).  IMO, current views on the
caste system make an automatic association between "jati" and "varnam".
   "jati" is associated with birth but from what I understood from
ShrI Anand's post, "varnam" is not.  Since our AchArya's views on
VedAdhikAram mention "varnam" only, how can we exclude people based on
"jati" alone?
   I kindly request corrections for any misunderstandings and/or
mis-statements on my part.

Thanks,

-Vivek.
