Yes, but it is advaita that resonates (/vip :-) with this vya.s.ti,
whereas dvaita the others inbetween seem flat.

Yes, indeed.  I have always read Shankara's commentaries as exposition
of advaita rather than discrediting other views (although that no doubt
played its part historically in re-establishing the tradition).

The W's always get me into trouble -- Who?  Which?  What?  Where?  When?
Whence?  Whither?  And the all-time favourite: Why?  :-)

I take that as an epithet for Shankara, in which case I must agree.

I was referring to the ancient causes of the system.  Checks and balances
only become necessary when the underlying wisdom no longer governs.

I don't have that one: sounds like it will settle my concerns about the
caste system -- but your posts have already done that quite effectively.

Ouch!  That's worth remembering!

Yes, that was an eye-opener for me.

Thanks for the pointer (4:13).  It was useful to re-read that with
Shankara's commentary pointing to the caste karma (18:42-44).
I confess that the quality that I associate with the vociferously
orthodox is arrogance (darpo vidyaadhanasvajanaadi nimitta utseka.h
is Shankara's commentary to 16:4) -- but that just illustrates that
this mind is unduly influenced by such agitation, and all too easily
misses the underlying gentleness in measured responses such as yours.

It is indeed a privelege to be on this list and to have my limited
interpretations refined and misunderstandings corrected.  This is
especially so for one working on his own, as I am.

I have thoroughly enjoyed your posts, both in tone and content, which
have illuminated an area that has been dark and troublous for me.
Thank you very much.

Kind regards, Charles.
