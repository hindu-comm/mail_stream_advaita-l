namaste.

I heard that there is a restriction on the Gayatri Mantra: that it can
be chanted only in India, or that it is effective only in that
geographical location. Is this true?

Moreover, this mantra is permitted to be chanted only by Brahmins: why?
(The Arya samaj, among others, has not followed this rule.)

Lastly, is there a connection between the above two questions: that
Brahmins are not allowed to travel outside India due to the lack of the
efficacy of the Gayatri Mantra beyond India's boundary?

I appreciate any help.

Thanks,

Kartik
