That would be an advanced lesson :-)
The beginners are taught that the different astral worlds are real and that
the astral body visits them during sleep. Just like our waking world is real
and that we go through its experiences. Slowly they learn to create different
realities and realize their unreality.

Probably. I cannot say much on this subject. I didn't read any material on
deep sleep state, except whatever is said by Ramana Maharshi.

I agree with you. That popular belief cannot be used to deduce the
self-luminosity of the Atman in dreams.
