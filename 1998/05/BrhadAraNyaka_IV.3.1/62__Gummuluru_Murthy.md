Namaste.

I gather from the response that it is the *astral body* that is out of the
physical body during the sleep (dream) process. Further, if a sudden shock
is applied to the physical body at that time, the link between the
physical and the astral body can be snapped or jarred with resultant
possible defects which Swami Nikhilanada mentioned. I originally took
Swami N.'s use of the word self as the Self, but now see that what Swami
N. calls self is the astral body. The Self (with the upper case S, the
Atman) is not involved in this process at all and of course is not
involved in any process.

It is a new concept to me that the astral body (even for an ordinary jeeva
without any yogic powers) can wander out of the physical body and can get
back into it. So, is my understanding correct then

(1) that during a dream process, the astral body is out of the physical
body and creates a world of its own (the sense organs are quiet, but the
mind is active and is the creator and venue of this dream world)

(2) that during deep sleep state, the astral body is within the physical
body, with the sense organs and the mind all folded into Atman.

(3) the fact that Atman is not involved in any of these processes is also
clear; Isha upanishhad says that Atman is faster than the mind and yet, it
does not move; that shows, Atman is not involved

Thanks for the clarification. Still, I do not see the use of the word
*confusion*. I see that the "confusion" is that of the subtle body to get
back into the physical body. But, I think the motion of the subtle body is
faster than any of the physical motions that can be imparted to the
physical body.

On a matter arising out of this, I have difficulty also with the last
sentence in that quote from Swami N. above ("... Therefore, through
this popular belief one can understand the self-luminosity of the Atman
in dreams."). I have no difficulty in seeing the self-luminosity of the
Atman, in the waking state, in the dream state or in the deep sleep state.
But, the above-discussed popular belief does not say anything about the
self-luminosity of the Atman during the dream process. The Atman remains
the same in all the three states and the above, I think, cannot be taken
as a proof of the self-luminosity of the Atman. That can never be
*proved*. It has to be accepted as shruti vAkya (YAjnavalkya talks of the
luminosity of the Atman with King Janaka in Br^hadAraNyaka u.).
