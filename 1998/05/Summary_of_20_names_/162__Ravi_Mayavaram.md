I will post the summary by this weekend. I am sorry for the delay.

The book I mentioned by shrI Subramania Aiyar did not have the
bhAshyam in original sanksrit but the only the stotram. Fortunately it
had pUrva and uttara for the trishatI and it was so sweet to read.
When I time permits, I will post the pUrva and uttara with meaning as
well.


With respects,
Ravi
