namaste!

vedas:
I understand that "shuka brahma" is a parrot and so is the pet of mandana
misra which engaged in debate with shankara.  Human birth is supposed to be
highest.
If birds (animals) can recite and engage in discussion,  why the
discrimination among humans.

Mokasha

Every entity in creation is eligible for moksha.   Remember the story of
"Sri Kala Hasti".   For those who dont know the story I will tell you briefly.
Once a sivalinga was worshipped by a spider, serpent, elephant and human
(kannappa).  They competed with each other in performing the puja with bhakti.
In their fierce competition they all died attained moksham by siva's grace.
