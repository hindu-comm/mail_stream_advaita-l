        No! mAyA is the world as we know it, but it is not all there is.
Take, for example, the state of deep sleep.  Clearly we do not know that
we have slept well (in the sense that there is no memory of deep sleep).
And yet one can infer whether he had or didn't have deep sleep. But
during that state there was no world, and hence there was no mAyA.

        I see that you misunderstand me. I am not talking about superior
or inferior concepts. I am just stating the way we function. Even the
attempt to know the meaning of one's existence is an attempt to know more
than what you already know, and therefore is a means of becoming
"something more than what you currently are".

And it would be a mistake to say I

How about: we currently don't know completely what we are?
Suppose you say that you know what you are. Then it follows that you are
what you know.  But clearly your knowledge always increases and so it
follows that you are not  what you already know, but what you will know.
Thus currently you do not know yourself :-)

Prashant.
