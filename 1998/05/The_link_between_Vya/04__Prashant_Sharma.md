        Having no sense of the doer doesnot imply that the doer is absent.
For if the doer is absent then clearly no *thing* is done, which is
contrary to your observation. If you analyse things a bit further you will
realise that there is always a doer, for the way we operate everything is
done for something.  There is nothing which is done for "its own sake".

        There is no way of "knowing" that you are consciousness (I mean
the way one knows that one is 'alive and kicking').  All these things are
more often inferred.  Also there is a sense in which AtmaAn is considered
the basis of it all which is not simply an equality. An oft quoted example
is that of light.  One cannot recognise white light, unless it disperses
into its constituent colours. And one says that "this is red or that this
is green".  One cannot equate white light to any one colour, but can do so
to all of them collectively.

        Again in the sense of the example given above.

        mAyA is not all encompassing.  mAyA is limited to the word, which
is knowledge.  Since there is no thought without word it follows that in
our present avatAr we cannot see beyond mAyA.  This is also why we have to
realise that eventhough the sages tell us that we are of the nature of
AtmAn we will never be able to know that in the same way as we know other
things around us.  The reason you cannot understand the connection between
AtmAn and what you are currently is because we understand things
piecewise (because our understanding is through words, which are
discontinuous). For example how do we claim an understanding of the world.
We do so by knowing the laws of nature.  But there is another level of
understanding involved in infering that a particular system behaves in the
way it does on the basis of those laws. Infact in this level of
understanding new laws are propounded (which are central to the observed
phenomenology), connections to the basic laws are then shown.  And it is
concluded that we understand the system to some extent.  Of course the
understanding is rarely complete (for real systems it simply cannot be
complete).  All this because the way we understand things is piecewise.
That is the way we function one has to accept these limitations.

        For a "jnani" there can be no experience.  That is why it is
non-dual. All experiences start a cycle of activity which is avidyA.  For
example a "bad" experience implies that next time similar situations shall
be avoided and so on.

        Clearly none can be made.  Think about what you are trying to do.
You think that you are something more than what you currently are.  And
you have to achieve that.  But you don't even know that you are currently
something, so how can you be something else?  One has to accept that what
we are is really only limited to what we know (memory, word ...).  Then it
follows that there is no*thing* else that you can be. The problem is are
you dissatisfied with this limitation, or do you want to boost your ego by
saying that you are more than this, that you are consciousness sublime and
all these hot-shot new age terms.  Or do you want to follow your vedic
dharma and realise this limitation and thus eventually attain brahmAn.

Prashant.
