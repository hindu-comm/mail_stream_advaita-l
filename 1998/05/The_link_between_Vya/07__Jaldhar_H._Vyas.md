I can think of two ways Vedanta gets around this difficulty.  One is that
we know the relation of Brahman and Maya through the Shruti. As it is
eternal and uncreated it does not suffer the defects of an ordinary
instrument of knowledge such as perception or interference.  The other is
that the cognition doesn't proceed from jiva -> Brahman but rather the
other way around.  Swami Madhusudan Saraswati and other more theistically
oriented acharyas employ this argument.  The jivas role is not passive
though.  He is to prepare himself to receive this insight through sadhana
etc.
