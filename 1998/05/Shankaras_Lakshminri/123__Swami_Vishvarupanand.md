  O Lord of Lakshmi, from whose navel emanates a lotus, O Lord
  of gods, O Vishnu, O Vaikuntha, O Krishna, O Madhusudana (slayer of
  Madhu), O Lotus-eyed One, O Brahmanya (the most exalted knower
  of Brahman), O Keshava, O Janardana, O Vasudeva, O Lakshmi Nrsimha, do
  You provide me the support of Your hands.

  [Note: Some of the names occurring in this verse have been explained
   by Shankara in his commentary on the VishhNu sahasra naama.
   For example, let us see what the sahasra naama bhaashhya says
   about "suresha."
   shaankarabhaashhya:

   sureshaH -
      suraaNaaM devaanaamiishaH - the Lord of the devas (gods).
     suupapado vaa raadhaatuH shobhanadaatR^iiNaaM iishaH -
      The prefix su indicates auspiciousness, and the root raa indicates
      bestowing. sura thus means one who bestows auspiciousness. Hari is
      the Lord of such sura's.]

   In one hand You hold the (sudarshana) discus; in another You
   hold the (paanchajanya) conch; another hand rests on (the waist of)
   the daughter of the ocean, Lakshmi; and the (fourth) hand signifies
   that You bestow boons and drive away the fear (of the devotees).
   O Lakshmi nrsimha provide me the support of Your hands.

Being drowned in the ocean of samsaaric existence, I am deluded.
O Lord! O Treasure of compassion! Turn your glance toward me who am
helpless. (Just as You) assumed the Supreme avatar for the purpose of
eradicating the sorrow of Prahlaada, do You, Lakshmi nrsimha, provide
me the support of Your hands.

You dwell in the hearts of the best of the Bhagavatas, such as
Prahlada, Narada, Parashara, Pundarika, and Vyasa. You are like the
desire-fulfilling tree in protecting the loyal devotees. O Lakshmi nrsimha,
provide me the support of Your hands.

This auspicious hymn has been composed by Shankara who is the bee engaged
 in drinking the nectar of the lotus feet of Shri Lakshminrsimha. In this
world, anyone who recites it will be filled with devotion to Hari and
will attain the undivided lotus feet of Brahman.

 [Note: With this conclusion, I have fulfilled a long-chersihed desire
of mine to translate the Lakshmi nrsimha stotra.  I would like to
acknowledge my gratitude to the Advaiti Prabodhaka Sangha, Dharwad,
Karnataka, whose Kannada translation of the shorter version of the
stotra  was useful in translating some verses.

The stotra appears in two versions. The shorter version has 13 verses,
and the longer version has 17. I have used the text of the longer
version which includes the two verses with references to Prahlada.
No stotra on Narasimha should, in my opinion, fail to mention
Prahlada, and this is why I opted for the longer version.

                      Drink deep from the ocean of nectar that is the lotus
feet of
                      Lakshminrsimha! ]
