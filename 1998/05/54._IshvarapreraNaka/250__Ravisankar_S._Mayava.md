54. IshvarapreraNakarI

SHE who directs Ishvara.

Ishvara is HER reflection in mAyA. SHE alone directs all
acts like creation, etc of the jagat.  SHE is the
consciousness which illuminates the will of Ishvara who
initiates creation.  As the consciousness reflected in the
power of concealment (AvaraNa shaktI)*, separation (vikShepa
shaktI), will, knowldge and action, SHE is the illuminating
will (IkShana) of Ishvara.  SHE facilitates future acts of
creation, etc. According to the shruti "saikShata"  it is
said that IkShaNa or will created Jagat and so on.

This name can also be interpreted in the another way. As the
wife of Ishvara, SHE obeys His commands and faithfully
follows them.
