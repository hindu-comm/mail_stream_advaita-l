Subject: RE:

I am a computer engineer currently working in Unisys. My interest in
advaita started when I was doing my engineering. I consider Sri.
Abhinava Vidya Theertha, Jagadguru of Sringeri Sharada Peetam as my Guru
and due to His infinite compassion & grace, I still have interest in
advaita, the faith in Ishwara and the desire to go up in the spiritual
ladder.
