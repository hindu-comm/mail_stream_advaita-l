SHE who is the single bliss.

"eka" means undifferentiated and "rasa" means bliss. SHE is the
undifferentiated bliss. "rasaM hyevAyaM labdhvAna.ndI bhavatI"
[taittirIyopaniShad 2-7-1]- "having possessesed bliss alone, HE
enjoys".

Among the navarasa, shR^ingAra (love)  is the most important. SHE is
that.

"eka" means parameshvara. SHE is the object of intense love of
parameshvara. Or SHE loves HIM intensely, as HE is HER husband.


"rasa" means sweetness which is agreeable to sAttvIkAH. As SHE is
Awareness limited by mAyA and primarily sAttvic, SHE likes sweetness.
"rasyAH snigdhA sthirAhR^idyA AhAraH sAttvikAH priyAH" - 'sweet, oily
and delicious foods are agreeable to sAttvikas"
