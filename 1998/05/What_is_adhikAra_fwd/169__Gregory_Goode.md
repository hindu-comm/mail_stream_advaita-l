I'd asked this same question on this list about a year ago.  The answer was
not based on shruti or smRiti, but on traditional oral teachings.  They
went like this:

Caste came to be based on birth because caste is based on the physical,
mental, intellectual guna-makeup in each individual's case.  The strongest
predictor and most important caual influence of a person's guna-makeup is
his psychobiology and early home training.  Therefore, one's parents come
to be the material cause, as it were, of one's guna-makeup.  My respondent
didn't address how exceptions are dealt with (adoptions, or say, a baby
born with totally different guna structure than the parents have), but this
was the explanation of a traditional way of looking at it.
