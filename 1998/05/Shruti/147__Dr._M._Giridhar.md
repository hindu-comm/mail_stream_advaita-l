        Shruti does not always mean vedas. The essence of Shruti's
can always be found in great works like bhagavad gita, yoga vasistha,
upadesasaram and my favorite, upadeshasahasri. Therefore, one can
get the import of Shruti from these texts if one is not eligible
to read the upanishhad-s. This has been made clear by HH of Sringeri
as well as that of Kanchi (See the books, The jagatguru answers
and the voice of god, respectively).  Many of the puraNaa-s also
give the import of Vedanta, as the recent posting from the
Adhyatma Ramayana showed.
