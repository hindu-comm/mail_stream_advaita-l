Namashkar,
   I cordially welcome ShrI Grimes to this forum and am looking
forward to learning a lot from him.

   I would like to know more about the significance of "kulam" in
advAitam.  Specifically, the deeper connotations of "kulam".
e.g. >all of creation; divine creative energy; power of consciousness
The only meaning that I was aware of was that of "family".

   Also, I understand that "kulam" is a very important concept in
Kashmiri Shaivam.  Is their idea of "kulam" different from the advAita
conception?  If so, how?

Thank you,

-Vivek.

I tried to make clear from the beginning that I cannot approach Vedanta
with the attitude that "This is The Truth... how can I best understand
it?" And what's more, I don't think such an approach is even desirable,
at least for me. My primary commitment is and has to be to a careful and
painstaking search for the truth, wherever that search may lead. It has
led me to Vedanta, but it could also lead me away from it again. In the
West, and particularly in the US, we have all too many people who have
put their commitment to doctrine above honesty and integrity, and the
distressing results are plain for the whole world to see. I must avoid
at all costs falling into a more sophisticated and educated version of
the same stance. I was a little concerned coming into the list that it
might be for internal discussion and criticism only, and that
questioning the validity of Vedanta itself might not be acceptable. But
the responses to my questions have been very helpful and constructive,
for which I am grateful. If it does become a problem at any point, I
will withdraw quietly.

Robert.
