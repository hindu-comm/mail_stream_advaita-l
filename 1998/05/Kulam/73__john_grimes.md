A wonderful wonderful book speaking about kula in the Advaita tradition is
The Guru Tradition (Gurukula) (Bharatiya Bhavan Book) - talks by the
Sankaracarya of Kanci on the subject.

Kulam is very important in Kashmiri Shaivism as you say. See Pandey's
Abhinnavagupta book for a thorough study of the term.

Both traditions employ the term and though there may be different nuances,
in a general sense I believe they use the term in a similar manner.
