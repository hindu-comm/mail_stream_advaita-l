Kula has no special significance in Vedanta.

Kula is a tantric term and though I don't know exactly how the Kashmiri
schools use it they are based on tantras and agamas.  (And Kaul is still a
common Kashmiri surname.)  Interestingly Shrividya upasakas like Shri
Bhaskararaya (who also consider themselves followers of Shankaracharya) do
use the word in the sense of a "family" or system of mantras.
