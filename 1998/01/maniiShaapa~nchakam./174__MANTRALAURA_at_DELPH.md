  "By the fraction of the fraction of which
(Awareness which is of the nature of) the
ocean of aananda these gods like Indra, etc.
are fulfilled, having gained (known) which in
a mind that is completely at rest, the muni
is fulfilled, one whose intellect is totally
melted in the (Awareness) which is eternal
and is of the nature of ocean of aananda is
Brahman itself, and not a knower of Brahman
(one who is thus Brahman itself by having

the king of the gods; (he is my guru), this
indeed is my firm conviction. (5)"
