sarvebhyo namaH,

  This is maniiShaapa~nchakam.h, Part 6,
shloka 3:

  shashvannashvarameva vishvamakhilaM
nishchatya vaachaa guroH
  nityaM brahma nirantaraM vimR^ishataa
nirvyaajashaantaatmanaa |
  bhuutaM bhaavi cha duShkR^itaM pradahataa
saMvinmaye paavake
  praarabdhaaya samarpitaM svavapurityeShaa
maniiShaa mama || 3 ||

  "By the teaching of the guru, the one who
has ascertained that the entire universe is
constantly perishing (and therefore unreal)
and who (following the teaching of the guru)
is constantly contemplating upon Brahman that
is eternal (and therefore real) by a mind
which is effortlessly tranquil, who is burning
past and future bad (and good) actions in the
fire of knowledge, and who has offered his
body (gross and subtle) to the praarabdha
(destiny), (such a jiivanmukta is my guru);
this is my firm conviction. (3)"

Note:  svavapuH = sva + vapuH
       sva = one's own, my own, his own,
             her own, our own, their own,
             etc. (referring to all three
             persons;
       vapuH = a body

dhanyavaadaH,
  Mantralaura
