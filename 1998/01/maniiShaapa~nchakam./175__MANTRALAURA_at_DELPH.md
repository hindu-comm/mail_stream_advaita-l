sarvebhyo namaH,
  maniiShaapa~nchakam.h was composed by
shaNkaraacharya. It is my understanding
that he composed it because Lord shiva had
appeared to him as a chaNDaala and when he
said, "Go away, go away . . .", Lord shiva
revealed himself to shaNkara. It was then
that he asked the Lord to teach him and he
wrote maniiShaapa~nchakam.h so that others
might learn from this lesson.
  Any notes that appeared in the text sent
out this past week were my own. The following
references were consulted:
