  "That (Awareness), clearly experienced as
'I' by animals, human beings, and gods, by
the light of which (Awareness) the mind, the
sense organs, the body and the objects shine,
though by themselves they are inert, the yogi
ever contemplating upon that Awareness which
is (as though) concealed by the (mind, the
sense organs, the body), illumined like the
orb of the sun even (when) covered by the clouds
(and because of which), who is fulfilled at
heart, is indeed my guru. This is my firm
conviction. (4)"

dhanyavaadaH,
  Mantralaura
