It's sad to say but much of the modern fascination with Vedanta stems from
people who think it's an excuse for not thinking straight.  This is a
reflection on them not Vedanta though.

We can't.

this list so it behooves us to look into the meaning of truth before
proceeding further.  Epistemology is one of the major preoccupations of
the Advaita Acharyas.
