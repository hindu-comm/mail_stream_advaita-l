That's all well and good but what happens after you know the truth?  The
progression from false notions to truth in not always steady, there might
be blind corners and false starts, but in the end it should be possible to
conclusively say if something is true or false.  (At least that's what I
following the Vedic tradition think.  You seem to be a lot more
pessimistic about our ability to know.)   Assuming you have made the
investigation and you are confident you know the truth, how should you act
towards that which you know to be wrong?

Other members of the list are also invited to answer this question.
