Namaste:
 The post by Mantralaura confirms what a lot us belive happened even in
ancient schools. As far as I have heard and sen, women are NOT prohibited
from learning or reciting the Vedas. In fact, a few days ag, I was
listening to (a cassette) a discourse on the Bhagavatam in 1959 by Sri
Sri Anantha rama Dikshidhar. He was saying how sad it is that women do
not recite or even learn the Vedas these days. So the fact that for close
to a century women have not decided to learn the Vedas is not a
reflection on the custom of the land. The only thing I have heard is
prohibited for women in Pancha-akshara Gayatri. They are allowed to
meditate on the Tri-akshara Gayatri.
 I guess one reason why women have not learnt the Vedas in the past is
because, by vedic law, what the husband and sons do in terms of japas or
Homas is sufficient for the mother and sisters of the house.

Cheers,
Vaidya.

Namaskar Gummuluru:

Let me try to answer your question with a story (I don't know the
author).

A great Krishna worshiper by the name, Jeevan was a great believer of
the Grace of God and was always expecting help of God.   He went to
Mathura to visit Brindavan and he had to cross the river Yamuna.   On
the banks of the river, no people were waiting except the drivers of the
boats.  He approached them and expressed his interest to cross the river
to visit Brindavan.  The boat operators explained the dangers of
crossing the river and refused to go.  However, Jeevan offered three
times the normal charges for the ride and a greedy person by the name
Mayan, after persuasion, offered to drive his boat.  When Jeevan sat on
the boat, Mayan provided him a life jacket and asked Jeevan to wear it
and warned him about the bad flood conditions of the river.  Jeevan
refused to wear the life jacket, laughing at Mayan and said that Lord
Krishna will protect them from all miseries. After traveling for few
yards, Mayan tried to convince Jeevan to return to the shore.
Nevertheless, Jeevan did not listen and shouted and ordered Mayan to
continue.  In spite of his constant praying for help, the severe
currents of the river damaged and capsized the boat.  Mayan with the
life jacket could cross the river by swimming.   Jeevan did not know
swimming and the river current dragged him.  Suddenly,  a floating tree
on the river stopped him and did not want to hold the tree and said to
himself: "The Grace of God will save me from this disaster."

After a short while, the waters of Yamuna submerged Jeevan's body.
Jeevan's soul met Lord Krishna and asked:
 " I prayed and requested for your Grace always;  why did you not come
to  rescue me?"


God replied:
"First, when you went to the river banks, I warned you through the boat
operators to save you. Second, I tried to offer you a Life-Jacket
through Mayan to save you.  Third, I suggested to you by the words of
Mayan to take you back to the shore. Finally, I send a floating tree to
help you to save you.  In spite of all my efforts, you refused to accept
my Grace. What else did you expect from me?"

The moral of the story is obvious.  God's Grace can come only to those
who are willing to accept it.  Let me state this famous quotation about
human behavior: "Some seek opportunities; some grab opportunities when
they come and some will not avail opportunities that are thrust on
them!" (I forgot the author's name).

Some more examples:
The Sun shines for everyone. Some gain from the light  and others get
burnt!
Rain pours the waters for everyone.  Some gain and others get drowned!

Finally, our scriptures use and ask us to apply common sense and
intuition. Both are based on personal experience!

Swamiji seems to agree that Brahman is the most powerful entity.  Should
the most powerful can create a Maya to mask the Brahman completely? The
answer is necessarily, yes because a "no" answer will contradict
Swamiji's assertion!  Please do not interpret this to mean that the
Swamiji has faulted.  We have no way of knowing the True Nature of
Brahman.  Religious philosophies attempt to help us to direct our
enquiries on TRUTH.  Any attempts to evaluate the religious philosophies
will only create an intellectual crisis and pitfalls.  Religion is just
a vehicle to find the TRUTH  and Religion by itself is not the TRUTH!
