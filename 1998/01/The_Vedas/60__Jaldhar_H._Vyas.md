Oh give me a break!  Why do you think I read this list except to get other
people opinions.  If I wanted to talk to myself I could save a lot on
Internet fees and just talk to my mirror.  By all accounts I'm one of the
more prolific posters here.  When I reply to people I always try and make
my responses fact-filled and back up arguments with references from
shastras, acharyas and with logical arguments.  (Unlike the bumper-sticker
slogans some people come up with.)  How much more evidence of dialog do
you want me to show?

What I don't do is treat all responses as being of equal merit.  Some
posters to this list I read avidly.  Others have yet to make a useful
contribution in all the time I've been here.  Although I've been sorely
tempted, I've resisted setting up a kill file for these people in the hope
that one day they might have something interesting to say but that's
probably wishful thinking on my part.

Let's review what I said.

1.  Women and foreigners cannot chant the Vedas.
2.  I detest the Arya Samaj.

I have yet to say anything inappropriate.  Another assumption I make on
this list is the other members are not children and are mature enough to
think about what they are reading.

Ignorant people get offended by all sorts of things.  It's no concern of
mine.
