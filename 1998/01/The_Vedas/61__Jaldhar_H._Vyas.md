1.  The Gita is Smriti not Shruti.

2.  Krishna Bhagawan is recommending his own worship not the Vedic rites.

3.  Look at this verse.  "Womb of sin"?  "Lowly Shudra"?  This is not very
egalitarian either is it?

4.  The translation is faulty.  For a start Partha means "descendent of
[King] Prthu" not "Prince of India"
