What's the point?  As a woman and a foreigner you are not entitled to
learn the Vedas anyway. If this swami of yours is telling you otherwise
you should sue him for malpractice.

Even if you were you wouldn't gain anything from those books which are
riddled with errors.  Particularly to be avoided is anything by the
heretic founder of the Arya samaj.  Despite having started of as a
Dashanami sannyasi (as the name Dayananda Saraswati suggests) he was no
friend of Vedanta.  He disliked Vedantas lack of enthusiasm fro rabid
nationalism.  (Today his followers are amongst the most fascist elements
on the Indian political scene.) In his half-baked philosophy (purely a
creation of his own imagination) only the Samhita parts of the Veda are
Shruti.  No astika thinker would ever agree to that.  He played fast and
loose with all other doctrines too.  It's mind-boggling that your swami
should suggest anyone read such nonsense.

Even if you had the right, and the requisite knowledge chanting mantras
would do you no good unless you followed all the rules.  What's the point
of meticulously following the one on proper pronounciation if you're going
to ignore all the rest?
