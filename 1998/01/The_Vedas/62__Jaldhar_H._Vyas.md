Better yet why call someone a fundamentalist fanatic when they are not?
Actually I suppose I am a fundamentalist in the sense that I base my views
on a certain body of doctrine but that's true of all Vedantins.  I suspect
you are using fundamentalist in a derogatory rather than descriptive
sense.

Like all Vedantins for instance.  The second Brahma Sutra is "Shastra
yonitvat."  Truth for Vedantins is the words of Jnana kanda of the Vedas.

You are pulling this stuff out of a hat.  Smriti cannot be ignored unless
it is in contradiction with Shruti.  That has been the Mimamsak view from
day 1 and no Advaita Vedantin has interpreted it differently.  Besides
which the Bhagavad Gita is a smriti.  Are you going to ignore that?  How
about the Yoga Vasishta or the Avadhuta Gita?

This statement by a major Vedantin (assuming it is translated correctly)
is far more uncomplementary to women than anything I've said.  But even
there the focus in not on women.  The author is a man, his audience are
men.

You've got the meaning of this passage exactly backwards.  It's because
she is a woman she is not studying Vedas.  She is not a Vedic student at
all.
