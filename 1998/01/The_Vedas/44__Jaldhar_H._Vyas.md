I should hope the teachings of the sages are appropriate for this list!

Peace is good.  It is a noble goal.  But peace is subordinate to truth.
In any situation were speaking the truth means upsetting the peace, peace
should take a back seat. I'll try to be as polite as I can but I don't
intend to back down from doing what is right.

Nice slogans but as someone who was brought up in a traditional
background, you know that's not true.

Where's the evidence?  (Historical I mean, not mythological.)

Note in the introduction to his Gitabhashya He also says that the smritis
like Mahabharat are for those like women and Shudras who are unable to
learn the Vedas.  Evidently he was not impressed by Mrs. Mishra :-)

And the idea that religion and society can be seperated is a modern
atheist one.  We expect the shastras to provide us not just instruction in
philosophy with and faith but who to marry, what to name ourselves, what
direction to sleep in and when to shave.  (This last injunction is highly
discriminatory against women but doesn't seem to upset the liberals so
much.  I wonder why?  :-)

Apart from sex and origin, the shastras make many other distinctions.
Station of life--some things are meant for Sannyasis only, others for
householders only.  Education--learned people can do things simple-minded
people are not allowed too.  Location--Some things that Bengalis do are
off-limits for Gujaratis and vice-versa.  Time--some activities only take
place on certain days or at certain astrological events.  And any number
of other things.

Far from being ashamed and trying to cover this up, we should be glad
Sanatan Dharma is not a "one size fits all" religion.
