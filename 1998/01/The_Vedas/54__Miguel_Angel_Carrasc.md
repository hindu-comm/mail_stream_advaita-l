I was quite shocked (but promised myself to count up to a million) when I
read the comment:  ^ÓAs a woman and a foreigner you are not entitled to
learn the Vedas anyway.^Ô

Having finished my count, I think there is no need to give reasons against
this statement, just a quote:

Bhagavad Gita 9 :
Thou Prince of India! Be certain none can perish, trusting Me! O Pritha^Òs
Son! whoso will turn to Me, Though they be born from the very womb of Sin,
Woman or man; sprung of the Vaisya caste Or lowly disregarded Sudra,- all
Plant foot upon the highest path.
