Do you respect him because he tells the truth or because he says what you
want to hear?

For saying what I did, I'm no more prejudiced against women and foreigners
than you are prejudiced against dyslexic people because you said one
should be careful in pronouncing.  It's a matter of standards.  One
can debate the nature of those standards but picking and choosing things
according to your whim strikes at the very heart of what Vedanta stands
for.

I do freely admit to being prejudiced against the Arya Samaj however.

even that opinion in a minute.  Intellectual honesty demands it.

It is childish to assume that the truth will always interest you or strike
your fancy.
