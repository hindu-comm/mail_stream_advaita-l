My philosophy on this matter is as follows:

No statement is wrong. Every statement is correct at the level of
understanding at which it is made. We always go from a lower truth to
a higher truth. This was made known to us repeatedly by Swami Vivekananda
and Swami Chinmayananda in their writings. The best any one can do is to
make known our understanding (at the moment) of the topic under
discussion. I look at these discussions as an opportunity for improvement
of myself rather than trying to improve others.

Namaskar Jaldhar:

First, please note that I am quite optimistic about changing our
behavior.   I had high hopes that my posting will have an impact on your
future replies.  I am glad to see that it did!  I am pleased to see your
positive response and your willingness to get the opinions of the list
members.   The sages and seers have the  used common sense approach
using intuition based on their personal experiences while making
conclusions.

Suppose a great cook serves a sumptuous dinner with a variety of foods
in a large plate to a hungry person.  If the hungry person, sees a ball
of dirt in the middle of that plate, he (she) will lose the appetite.
Such a situation is beneficial neither for the cook nor for the hungry
person.  A similar fact holds well for an intelligent and scholarly
person while making comments.  After a careful and thorough
investigation, if the scholar's reply contains intelligent answers using
inappropriate words, the attention gets diverted and the message gets
lost!    The rule of common sense says that don't offend anyone unless
it is absolutely necessary.  If the list members disagree with this
view, let me know!

None of us are free from making mistakes and we change our behavior
every moment when necessary. Aren't we?
