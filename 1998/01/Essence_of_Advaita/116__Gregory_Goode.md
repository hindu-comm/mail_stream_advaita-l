With all these insightful observations:

>I do accept and understand that all questions arise in the mind.
>That the mind is not an entity, but only a stream of thoughts.
>That one of those thoughts is the body and the person.
>That all the world is a set of thoughts.

... etc. ...

Then you probably see that you've already cut the Gordian knot.  It's not
something you can just sit down one day volitionally and do.  It's Grace,
and it is a spontaneous arising (or falling away, of the questions) when
the Absolute is ready for it it to happen.
