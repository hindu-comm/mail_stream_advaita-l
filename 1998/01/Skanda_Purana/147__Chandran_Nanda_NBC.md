Does the Skanda in Skanda Purana refer to Lord Muruga, the son of Shiva and
Parvathi, who is worshipped in Tamil Nadu? I remember some time back Vidya
made a statement that Muruga or Skanda is worshipped only in Tamil Nadu and
not elsewhere. Is this true? If this is true, how come Skanda Purana is in
Sanskrit and not Tamizh? Or is it Skanda's following has declined in the
North of Bharat over a period of time?
