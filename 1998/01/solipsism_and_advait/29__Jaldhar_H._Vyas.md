It seems to me that solipsism is more in tune with the charvaka darshan
(from what little we know of it.)  While we also believe in the ultimate
non-existence of time, space etc we don't treat that isn't a carte blanche
to disregard them.  Rather than reject the "outside" world one should know
it and reach beyond it.  Then you can reject it.
