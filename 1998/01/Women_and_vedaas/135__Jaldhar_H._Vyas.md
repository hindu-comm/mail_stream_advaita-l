I belong to Madhyandina shakha of Shukla Yajurveda and one of the parts of
our Veda is the Shatapatha Brahmana.  Maharshi Yagnavalkya saw this work
and taught it to a 100 rshis.  In there, the rules of Vedic study are
given.  It is noted that one who has not had Upanayan sanskara is
ineligible to study the Vedas.  In another section the rules for Upanayan
are given.  First the rules for Brahmans are given.  Second for
Kshatriyas, and third for Vaishyas.  Shudras are not mentioned.  Therefore
the inference is they are not eligible.  Furthermore, all the references
to the person undergoing the ceremony are in the masculine tense.
Therefore we infer that women are not eligble.

In the section on the monthly rites called Darshapaurnamaseshti it is said
that the yajaman should not talk to women or shudras for the duration of
the ceremonies.  In the Katyayana Shrauta Sutra which is the Vedanga which
codifies ritual for this shakha it says the reason for this is because
women and Shudras are unlearned in the Vedas.

Why assume there is any reason?  We are not spending time debating why
married ladies wear a mangal sutra around their necks and men don't.  We
just accept this as womens custom.  In the same way, Vedic learning is
mens.  (And not all of them at that.)  Nothing sinister need be inferred.

Note that by later times the author means the past couple of _thousand_
years.

Given that we know next to nothing about "early Vedic times" even when
exactly they were, this is pure guesswork on the part of the author.

I looked at three different printed copies of the Vajasaneyi Samhita
(Which I assume is what is meant by Shukla Yajurveda and and this
vers is _not_ 36:2.  In fact there is no mantra beginning Yatha imam
anywhere in this samhita.

Are you sure this not from some Purana?  The Vedas don't have narrators.

The "first appendix" to the Manusmrti?  Yeah right.

Who wrote this sandhya book?  They do not seem to be too reliable.
