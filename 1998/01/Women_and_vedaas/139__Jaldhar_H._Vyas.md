If you like amend that to "Everyone associated with the Vedas said that
women and non-Indians cannot study the Vedas." It amounts to the same.

Of course it is the mahatmas of each age we are interested in, not just
anyone but maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to learn about the
scoundrels either.  After all they are also part of the reason we are what
we are today.  One can't ignore ones history just because it might not be
to ones liking.

By opponents I mean people who disagree with me not neccessarily enemies.
Unfortunately, many of these people have grown up ignorant and ashamed of
their religion but I have high hopes that if I keep up principled
objections long enough, they will see the futility of their
misconceptions.
