  Comments: I think it is not as simple as the 'eye can't see itself'
reason implies. The real question is are we anything other than this
"automaton" shadow? Notice that it is the mind which is asking this
question and it can't accept a NO for an answer, simply because it doesn't
exist in the subspace of the mind.  Therefore the mind shall look for
answers everywhere except in the "right" place and because none of the
answers are true the mind has to flit around these abstractions.  So one
day it is satisfied with some philosophy and some other day something else
catches its fancy, but none of them are true (for if they are why aren't
all the questions resolved by them?). So the search continues.

What is it that wants to get rid of the shadow: that which created the
shadow, in the first place. It is the mind which created this division of
the shadow and something which observes the shadow. How can you get rid of
this division until this whole system ends? All one can do is to recognise
this system and realize that, for all one knows, it is not meant for
something nor even is something.

        Do you really have this choice? All this talk about watching
oneself is really an afterthought isn't it?.  When one acts there are no
watchers and no doers.  It is when the mind is not fully occupied in
activity that one can watch oneself.  It is for such times that the
concept of duty comes in as a guide to the "minimum entropy" way
(perhaps!).
