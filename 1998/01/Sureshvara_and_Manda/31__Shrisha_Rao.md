Actually, all scholars are grammarians, no matter what school they
belong to.  They have to be, otherwise their statements, in favor of
whatever school, would be ungrammatical.  Thus we have Patanjali's
bhAshhya on the Panini-sUtra-s, Amarasimha's kosha, etc., considered
authoritative by Vedantins, although their respective doctrines (Yoga
and Jaina) are not similarly regarded.

What is pertinent here is the fact that while Vedantins do study
mImAmsA, the reverse is not true.  This distinction is perhaps
hypothetical given that there are no pure-blooded mImAmsaka-s any
more, but if one were to exist, then he would not study Vedanta.  As
such, the fact that a given scholar has read or written on both
mImAmsA and Vedanta is indicative of the fact that he is a Vedantin,
not that he is a mImAmsaka.  One is not aware of any counter-example
to this rule.

I'm not sure what you're getting at here, but the issue is the
divergence of views between Sureshvara and Mandana Mishra;
Prakashananda's status in the Advaitic tradition, his "discovery,"
etc., don't really count either way in the main issue.
