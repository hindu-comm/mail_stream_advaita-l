Well, Vidyashankar has answered this well for me.  It is Grammarian in the
sense of sphotavadi that I meant.  Writting grammatical Sanskrit no more
makes you a Sphotavadi than reading the Advaita list makes you an Advaitin
:-)

Certainly the Bhattas and Prabhakars do not seem to.  (Though
interestingly I have read that Parthasarthi Mishra the commentator on
Prabhakar Mishra's Brhati took sannyas under the name Amalanand and
commmentated on Vachaspati Mishras Bhamati.)  However in Sureshwaracharyas
Sambandha Vartika there are many descriptions of other Mimamsaka views
some of which overlap with Vedanta.  For example, jnanakarmasamuccayavada
was a view of Mimamsakas as well as Vedantins.  Unlike the "orthodox"
Mimamsakas who thought the Upanishads were all arthavada, these people
believed that meditation was a type of action to be performed alongside
the other vidhis.

Ok, sorry I thought you were basing your thesis on Prakashananda's views.
