I am grateful to Shri Sadananda for his well-thought-out and as usual
thorough response to my post. Human effort versus God's grace is only
a very minor part of my post and is not intended to open that debate
afresh again. The main purpose of my post is to look at moksha as
freedom from individuality which would result in advaita or non-duality
as the only meaning of moksha. I would be grateful if Shri Sadananda and
other list members comment on that portion of my post as well.

Now, coming to Shri Sadananda's comment on the necessity of human
effort: it is necessary, but may be given too much importance.

The physical effort (action) is certainly inferior to mental and as
such, physical actions need not be considered. The only human action
that is of any relevance is the meditation. Shri Shankara uses the
following arguments to say that meditation cannot lead to moksha.
This argument by Shri Shankara is part of his debate with ManDana
Mishra.

1. The standard points on which we meditate, or what our gurus ask
   us to meditate on, are the upanishhadic statements aham brahmAsmi,
   tat tvam asi etc.  They are statements of truth and not
   commandments for human action.

2. If we say that such meditation will lead us to moksha, what that
   implies is moksha will be an effect of action. Meditation is a
   mental action, and like any action, it can be done, or not done,
   or done in a contrary fashion. The implication of making moksha an
   effect is to make it impermanent like swarga and all attainments
   generated by human activity. This is the very negation of moksha.

3. In meditation, we impose one entity on another by an assertion of
   the will and generate a new effect which did not exist before.
   Knowledge of Brahman is not an activity like that of converting
   Atman which was not Brahman before, into Brahman by mental
   assertion. Brahma vidya is knowledge and not meditation. Knowledge
   is a mental mode of "being what one has always been" and not of
   "becoming into something that was not before".

4. The text tat tvam asi declares the eternal nature of things. The
   passages in the upanishhads which look like commandments (like
   for e.g. "This Atman should be heard of, meditated upon" etc) are
   only for removing the obstacles or coverings. Jnana or knowledge,
   if it can be called an action at all, is only of the nature of
   removal of obstacles, and not of bringing about a new condition
   or effect. When the obstacles are removed, the truth that "the
   Atman has always been Brahman" stands revealed. This is not an
   effect but what is in the nature of things.


Thus, human actions do not lead to moksha; at best they only remove
obstacles. I am not saying that human effort is not necessary. It is
indeed vital. But there is something else (which a human mind cannot
comprehend) that leads to moksha.

Again, as I mentioned before, human effort vis-a-vis the grace of
God is only a minor part of my earlier post. I would be grateful if
the members comment on the latter portion of my earlier post as well.

Namaskar,

The assumption of the "Grace of God" works like a catalyst to purify the
corrupted mind.  This attitude attributes  human actions and the results
to God's Grace.  Those who totally surrender their ego to God cannot
perceive any duality.  They really do not seek Moksha but only seek the
Grace of God.   In Mukunda Mala, Kulasekara Alwar appeals to Lord
Krishna to help him to pray all the time!  He requests Lord Krishna to
remove all desires other than the desire to chant HIS name.

When we start using our yardstick to judge, we see differences
everywhere and with everyone and at every moment.  Does this imply that
we are different? Explanations, definitions, and judgements confirm the
absence of the Grace of God! The acceptance of Grace of God also
requires the Grace of God.  It is the grace of God that helped me to
write and it is the Grace of God that will help you to read and it is
also the Grace of God that will help some to reply and correct me!
