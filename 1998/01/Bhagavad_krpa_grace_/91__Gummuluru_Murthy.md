Namaste.

It takes a bit more time for me to digest what Shri Sadananda has written.
In the meanwhile, I would like to pose this question.

I would like to think this way. Wherever there is a jeeva, there is
avidya. Wherever there is avidya, there is jeeva. Without jeeva, there is
no avidya; and without avidya, there is no jeeva. Thus, avidya and jeeva
are synonymous.

Avidya and jeeva have the same beginning and the same end (if jeeva and
avidya have beginning at all). Advaita literature says avidya is anAdi,
without beginning. Would the same thing not apply for a jeeva also ?
Further, is not "Adi", the beginning, a concept associated with avidya
also ?

I would be grateful for clarification.
