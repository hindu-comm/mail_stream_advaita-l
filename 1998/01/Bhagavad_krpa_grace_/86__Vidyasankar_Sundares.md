Murthy garu, none of these notions will make any sense unless one relates
them to the I-notion. If you know yourself to be brahman, there is no more
karma, no need of bhagavad-kRpA, and in fact, you are no more an
individual jIva. If this brahman-knowledge is not known, then everything
falls into place, doesn't it?

Part of imagining one's self to be a jIva involves the notion of agency.
So long as one feels that one is a kartA (doer), karma will take place.
Also, so long as there is the notion of kartA-hood, the jIva continues to
act. Therefore, past karma does not fully determine future lives and
actions. There is such a thing called Agamin-karma, the action yet to
be performed, over which the jIva has control. So where do ISvara and kRpA
fit in? The answer is that the Lord arbitrates over the fruits of karma,
and like a merciful judge, can alleviate suffering if necessary. The
notion of God is like that of law and justice - everyone is considered to
be equal, but that does not mean that a thief goes unpunished or that
honest effort is not rewarded - this is the ancient Vedic concept of Rta.

I think the best work to read in this connection is the Yoga-vasishtha.
It is very long, but reading a few excerpts from Swami Venkatesananda's
translation should be very useful. The very first chapter, where Goddess
Sarasvati teaches queen Lila, talks of karma, daivam, effort etc.

The only thing I would like to point out is that mAyA does not completely
mask brahman, but is brahman what we see? Don't we all see the plural
world? Remember that Sruti says that all this is brahman, but also says
that brahman is the Atman, and that it is partless and changeless.

vidyAraNyasvAmin's pancadaSI has a very pithy verse regarding mAyA, which
essentially says - if one correctly understands the Vedas (Srauta), it
does not exist (asat); by reasoning (yuktita), we conclude that it is
indeterminate (anirvAcyA), but for the worldly minded (laukika), it is
real (vAstavI) indeed.
