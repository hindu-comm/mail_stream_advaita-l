A thought that came to mind:  what if you change the point of view
and consider that karma IS bhagavad kr^pa?   Bhagavad is then like
an indulgent parent and we the spoilt children.  He will give you
whatever you desire, but you have to take everything that goes with
it.  As a simple illustration, if you want children, then you must
accept twenty years of responsibility as a parent; similarly, if you
want wisdom, then you must give up ignorance.

What if you view karma as a gift, an opportunity, and not a punishment?

Just a thought.

Charles.
