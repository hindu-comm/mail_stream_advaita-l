Namaste.

As I understand: The above analogy may not be entirely appropriate. As
Shri Sadananda pointed out, Saguna Brahman and mAya cannot be separated,
while Nirguna Brahman is beyond mAya.

I always view Nirguna Brahman as that quietness, stillness on which
everything is superposed. I visualize ourselves as tiny bubbles with
no reality, superposed on that vast very quiet body of water. Just like
that bubble has no individuality, we do not have individuality either,
but merge with water again and again. But, we falsely think we have
individuality and in order to explain our falsely proclaimed
individuality, we invoke Saguna Brahman. Although it may be controversial,
let me state that without invoking Saguna Brahman, we can feel our direct
identity with Nirguna Brahman.
