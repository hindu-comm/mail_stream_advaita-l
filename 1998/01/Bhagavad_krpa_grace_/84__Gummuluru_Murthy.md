I sent this message to the List this morning, but somehow it seems to have
reached only Shri Ram Chandran. I am posting this now on the advaita-list.

Namaste.

I would like to express my understanding of the topic and I would be
grateful for any clarification.

Brahman is nirguna. God is saguna.

1.  Just like we, the humans, are saguna, God also is with the following
    differences. God has only good gunas, while we the humans are endowed
    with bad and good gunas.

2.  God is the controller of mAya while we the humans are the ones
    controlled by mAya.

3.  Nirguna Brahman is beyond God, but devoid of action. I mean by God,
    the saguna Brahman as per literature.

4.  Just like, we the humans are product of mAya, similarly also, God
    (the saguna Brahman) is also the product of mAya.

5.  Brahman of the upanishhads is not God, the saguna Brahman, but nirguna
    Brahman.

6.  God, the saguna Brahman is as real or as unreal as we the humans. The
    only reality is nirguna Brahman.

Is is futile to try to understand Brahman. Appreciation of That as the
basis is all what can be done in this embodied form. I think a philosophical
understanding (again, a better word is appreciation) of Brahman is much more
important than a scientific one. Science looks at cause and effect.
Brahman is beyond cause and effect.
