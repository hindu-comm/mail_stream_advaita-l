Namaste:

 I would like to give here an example that I guess is quite popular in
regards to explaining the differnece between Saguna Brahman and Nirguna
Brahman.

 Consider light. It has all the colours that exist. yet, the simple fact
that the colours are all combined makes LIGHT colourless. Similarly, I
consider the difference between Nirguna Brahman and Saguna Brahman is not
a result of Maya. The fact that Brahman is embodied with all Gunas makes
it Saguna and thus makes it Nirguna. They are one and the same; they are
ever present in each other. So, saying that Divine mercy is required and
appealing to Saguna Brahman is not an indicator of we being covered by
maya. If members feel this point of view is wrong for specific reasons,
kindly point it out.

Vaidya.
