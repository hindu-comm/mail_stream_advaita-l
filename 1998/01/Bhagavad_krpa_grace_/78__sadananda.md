Phsical actions involves mental attitudes and that make a difference hence
even the physical actions can be converted into yoga as karma yoga for
purification of the mind.  .

There is no difference in what we both are saying.  What is in our control
is our human effort.  The grace will come automatically for those that
deserve.

Contemplation or Meditation as means is also action at mental level. There
is an inquiry involved for knowledge to take place. It is not negating the
mind.  It is using the mind to go beyond the mind like a pole walt.  Who I
am or what is the souce of contents of the thougts or even jagat involves
an intense inquiry by a prepared mind ( pure mind). Meditation involves
meditator, meditated and meditating.  By meditation one goes beyond
meditation - that happens by grace.

Hence human effort is upto the end and one goes beyond the begining and end
by grace. Ultimately one can declare as Bhagavan Dattatreya says in
Avadhuuta Gita
        aham dhyaataa param dhyeyam akhandam khadate katham|
I am the meditator and meditating on the supreme - how can one divide the
indivisible?
Hari Om!
