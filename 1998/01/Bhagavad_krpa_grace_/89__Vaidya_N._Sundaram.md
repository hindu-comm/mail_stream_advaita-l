 I think that analysing the different kinds of Karma is relevant. I have
heard that PrArabdha Karma is such that even Bhagavad Kr^pa cannot wipe out
it's effects. PrArabdha karma means karma that has started having effect.
So, karma limits us only as far as we have not surrendered. The moment we
surrender, karma performed by the Jiva is not the responsibility of the Jiva.
At this time of total surrender, all previous karma is also wiped out.
As to whether God's kr^pa exists even in the state when the Jiva has not
completely surrendered, it surely exists. But as Sri Ram Chandran has pointed
out, we should be in a frame of mind to receive it.
 The level of the Jiva in spritual evolution is relevant in the context of
complete surrender. Without sufficient faith in Bhagavad Kr^pa, the Jiva will
not completely surrender. The faith in His mercy is total only upon a clear
understanding that it is His will that Is. All the rest of Doer-ship is Maya.
I agree with Sri Vidya Shankar's point of view when he says that Karma has
its effects felt only as long as the feeling of Doer-shipp and Ego exists.

I think the following quote from the Bhavad Gita is relevant:

   Bg 8.3 The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The indestructible,
   transcendental living entity is called Brahman, and his eternal nature
   is called adhyatma, the self. Action pertaining to the development of
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   the material bodies of the living entities is called karma, or
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   fruitive activities.

 Karma is always a fetter, a bondage, no matter whether it is Good karma
or Bad karma. To enjoy the fruits of karma, again good or bad, one has to
be born again. In the birth taken to enjoy the fruits of karma, one continues
to commit more deeds and so incur more karma. The cycle is thus repeated.
A point worth pondering here is whether Good karma makes you do ONLY good
deeds. If that is not true, then you are worse off than where you started.
So, one's attempt should always be towards the recognition that it is the
Ego that makes us feel we are the Doer.

Quote from the Bhagavad Gita:

   Bg 3.5 Everyone is forced to act helplessly according to the qualities
   he has acquired from the modes of material nature; therefore no one
   can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment.

   Bg 5.15 Nor does the Supreme Lord assume anyone's sinful or pious
   activities. Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the
   ignorance which covers their real knowledge.

I think the above clearly shows that Actions / Karma are brought on by the
Jiva on himself/herself and Divine intervention is not called for at all.

Cheers,
Vaidya.
