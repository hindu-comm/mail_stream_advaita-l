Dear Friends,

Some members are posting full-length articles from the Hindu Online
and other such online newspapers. These articles, while relevant to
this forum, are in fact copyrighted by the respective newspapers and
magazines. So, may I request the members who wish to share the
information they find in these online newspapers to just send the
appropriate URL address, and perhaps give a short summary, if
necessary. Posting of full-length articles from these online
newspapers should be avoided.

Thanks,
govindarajan
