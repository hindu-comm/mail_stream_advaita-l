One can find many examples of inequality in the current world and not just
in "primitive" places either.  California, the most populous state, has
exactly the same representation in the senate as a sparsely populated one
like North Dakota.  In sports, there is a seperate womens NBA, and the
players in the mens NBA make a lot more money.  Not to mention all sports
discriminate against the slow and fat even though a substantial number of
americans are overweight.  In the economic sphere, pay scales are vastly
different for different jobs and in the same job for different locations.

And on this list, people definitely pick and choose about what they want
to consider equal.

Given that equality is hardly the norm, a better question might be why
should egalitarianism be considered a valid criteria to judge?

This is why Hinduism will survive the present crop of critics as it has
survived all others.  Hypocrisy will always eventually collapse under the
weight of its own contradictions.
