>Quote from the Bhagavad Gita:

   Bg 3.5 Everyone is forced to act helplessly according to the qualities
   he has acquired from the modes of material nature; therefore no one
   can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment.

   Bg 5.15 Nor does the Supreme Lord assume anyone's sinful or pious
   activities. Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the
   ignorance which covers their real knowledge.

I think the above clearly shows that Actions / Karma are brought on by the
Jiva on himself/herself and Divine intervention is not called for at all.>

Wen, for an advaitin, is the divine not intervening?
