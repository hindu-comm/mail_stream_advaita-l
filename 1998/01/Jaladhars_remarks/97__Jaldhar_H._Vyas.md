Yes.

Well for a start you have to define relevancy.

Hear hear!

Well, my first problem is my general abbhorrence of falsehood.  I am by no
means perfect in this regard but when I hear someone say something which I
know to be untrue, I can't help but comment.

The second problem is the shastras are not for me some cheap paperback you
pickup at the airport bookshop on the way to your trip to San Francisco.
They are my patrimony.  My ancestors may not have left me much in the way
of worldly goods but what they have left is worth more than gold.  I react
to its misuse the same way as I would to being mugged.

The third problem is I disagree with the very notion that people should be
doing things meant for others and by prescribing unequal duties, Hinduism
is doing anything wrong.  In fact the supposedly progressive ways of
thinking are more injurious to womens rights and needs.
