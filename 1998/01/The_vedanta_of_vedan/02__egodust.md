Yes--as I alluded to in the post--, along with philosophical speculation,
viveka and other yogic sadhanas (such as vairagya, bhakti and karmayog)
have their [vital] place on the path of jnana.

The concept of a destroyed mind, in my understanding, has more to do
with the individual's ability to be dispassionate to the works of Mind.
Although the thoughts will continue, the jivanmuktha is not manipulated
by them...rather is centered on brahman, which isn't different from the
thought-works themselves, yet embraces all conceivable thoughts plus
the not-thoughts.   A neat motto is, "Act as though everything matters;
be as though nothing does."

I agree.  This point was raised on the List earlier.

Many Buddhists (Zens, Chinese, Tibetan), some Sufi's, and Westerners such
as Robert Adams, Gangaji, Wei Wu Wei, and Wayne Liquorman are insightful
advaitic teachers.

Namaste.
