 It is easy to say be like wood or stone but you can't do it until you
first have viveka and you can't get this without an investigation into
truth and falsehood.  You cannot be like wood or stone and cling to "daily
life.  That's why the importance of sannyasa is stressed.

No.

Is Vedanta necessarily based on the Vedas?

Yes.

Rather you should say they are a help right up until the end.  After,
there is no need for that path but there is no need for other paths either
so the question is moot.

So why do all these different paths exist?  We are all creatures of time
and space.  That's how we understand things and that's how we approach
paths.  We need to understand their different traditions, and histories
and beliefs and not just sweep it all under the rug.

Of course not because Jnani is a concept that arose in Hindu culture and
makes sense in that context.  It would be like saying "Outside of Spain,
there don't seem to be many cities called Madrid."  That wouldn't surprise
anyone would it?

Dogmatism and intolerence are part of the human condition and no culture
even Hinduism can claim to be more immune to them.  And that's not always
a bad thing.  Moral principles are a form of dogmatism.  Standing up to
evil is a form of intolerance.
