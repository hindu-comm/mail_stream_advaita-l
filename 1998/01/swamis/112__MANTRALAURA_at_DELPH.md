Namaste Nagy,
  When I visited the Arsha Vidya Gurukulam in PA, I sat
in the front row at almost every lecture of Swami Dayanada's
and he embraced me as a long time friend and we had many
private talks where he tried to help me with my personal
problems -- and I didn't have money -- only the desire to
learn and understand atma.

dhanyavaadaH,
  Mantralaura
