I, durai, am a member of the advaita mailing list at present.
I receive mails at the above e-mail address right now.
Is it possible to send the advaita mails to another address
of mine ALSO viz. vsnl.itbmd at gems.vsnl.net.in
Please note that the present address-durai at md2.vsnl.net.in
will also remain on the mailing list.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Durai
