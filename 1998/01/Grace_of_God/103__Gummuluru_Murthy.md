The solution is simple. Please recognize that what is following you is
just a corpse, an inert thing. That body of you will follow you until
it completes its (and the subtle body's) karma. Then, it would fall off
of its own accord. You should not be effected by what follows you. You
are sat-chit-ananda, completely uneffected and oblivious of what is
following you or what is being seen by that subtle and gross body
combination. Recognize That and enjoy the bliss.

As for the grace of God, and the implicit duality, I agree that there
is duality in that concept. However, I think it is a required and
sequential step as that concept is required for the annihilation of
the ego of the human. Once the ego has been destroyed, and the
surrender to the Saguna Brahman is complete and without reservation,
the non-duality and identity with nirguna Brahman arises as the last
step in the jeeva's "journey" in overcoming the mAya.
