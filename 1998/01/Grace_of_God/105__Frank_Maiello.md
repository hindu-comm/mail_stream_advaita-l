Sankara's Tripura Formula tells us that saguna *is* nirguna so long as
perceived not as something unto itself.  As you indicated, "Even this mail
is an illusion appearing in His consciousness."  (Incidentally, it's more
accurate to say 'Its' rather than 'His,' since nirguna is attributeless.)

Yes, the [dualistic] concept of grace is a temporal strategy, as are the
concepts of egoic 'free will' or its applied process of 'mind purification,'
which are theoretically used by the jiva who believes he's a jiva!  Jnana
shatters this charade.

By the *perseverence* of atmavichara.  As Jack Kerouac says, "Walking on
water wasn't built in a day."

There's ever only one Self among us.

OM shaanthi shaanthi shaantiH.

Reply to the Posting of Shri Sadanand and Shri Gummuluru Murthy

Namaskar Sadanand and Gummuluru:

Thanks for your excellent replies to my earlier posting on the nature of
Brahman.  I am not surprised with your questions and explanations! The
purpose of my exercise was to illustrate that intellectual analysis and
framework can not answer the question on the nature of Brahman.
Intellectual analysis either starts with questionable assumptions and/or
questionable conclusions. This is an expression of intellectual
pitfalls.

But we don't want to be in a pathless land with no directions for
leading a spiritual life.  The fundamental differences among the
concepts enunciated by the various schools of Vedanta supported by the
masters including Sankara, Ramanujar and Madhawacharya should not deter
us from attempting to understand the philosophy from the Upanishads. Any
attempt to sort out these differences at an intellectual level can
beocme an exercise without results. It is desirable, rather, to follow
the Advaita Philosophy (or others) with single-minded faith and try to
understand Sankara's peception of what the Upanishds say. With our life
time that is the only possible thing for us to do. I fully agree that
answers to spiritual questions can be realized only with personal
experience.

Let me thank both of you for your time and thoughtful clarifications of
my exercise.

With my regards,

Ram Chandran
Burke, VA.
