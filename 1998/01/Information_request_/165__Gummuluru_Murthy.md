Namaste.

Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi published a compilation
"A Concise History of Science in India" with D.M. Bose as Chief Editor
(and S.N. Sen and B.V. Subbarayappa as Editors). In that, there is a
chapter on Astronomy by S.N. Sen which traces the knowledge of astronomy
to the Vedic times, with very liberal references to various upanishhadic
and vedic statements. It is an authoritative study. It traces the
nakshatra system, lunar zodiac, the vedic calendars and vedanga jyotishha,
ecliptic and the eclipses among other things. I use part of this material
in the course I give on astronomy. This is an excellent reference for
anyone interested in vedic astronomy. The LOC Number for this book is
Q 127 I4B58 1971.
