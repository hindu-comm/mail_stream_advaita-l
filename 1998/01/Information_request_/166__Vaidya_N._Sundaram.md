Namaste:

 There is a book by Krishnamurthy, J (former Dy. Director of Birla Institute
of Technology and Science, Pilani, India) called " Clock in the Night Sky".
This book is basically about the systems of telling the time of the night
just by looking at the arrangement of the stars. But it is also a good
introduction to general astronomy and also contains quite a few Sanskrit
Quotes from various sources. I have not seen the book anywhere in the U.S
though. I am sure that it will be available in India.

Cheers,
Vaidya.
