Congrats on the new web site. I will be happy to put a link up on our site.
If you could return the favor that would be great. Our site is: Hawaii
Village: http://www.hilo.org/hi  We are new also so if anyone else out there
would like to trade links that would be good. Sorry to use this newsgroup
for website news. If this is inappropriate I apologize profusely.

Namaste,
Steve
