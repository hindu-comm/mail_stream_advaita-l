NO! it did not happen and I am not expecting anything to happen!

Something is holding me.  I can not pinpoint what it is but I feel it is

Let me paint you a picture!   I have lot of debts, I have a daughter to be

1. Ignore the world, forget responsibilities and GO
2. Stay and discharge responsibilities.

Anybody Advise!
