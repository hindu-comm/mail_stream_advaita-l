Thanks Chuck!

To know who goes and who stays..

Read the life stories of Sri Raghavendra of Mantralayam (19th century) and
recently Ramadas (west coast of India).  They were in same quandary but they
ignored their responsibilities.  The result is Raghavendra's wife commited
suicide and Ramdas family left alone.
