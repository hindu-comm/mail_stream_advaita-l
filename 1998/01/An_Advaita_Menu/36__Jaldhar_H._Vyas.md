Yes there are some different diverging tendencies between different
Advaita Vedantins though they agree on most issues.  Further complicating
the issue is there are many "fellow travellers" who take up advaita ideas
when it suits them and drop them when it doesn't.  Also there are Indian
schools of thought which are non-dualistic but not Vedic at all.

B.  Is wrong because time is an illusion in the paramarthik sense
therefore concepts such as past and future have no meaning.

B is not a position of Advaita Vedanta.  It sounds more like the views of
Vallabha the founder of the Vaishnava sect called Pushti Marg.
Interestingly he called his philosophy Shuddhadvaita (or "pure" Advaita)
because like many Vaishnavas, he felt that Advaita Vedanta was "tainted"
by the theory of Maya.

The Atma is Brahman embodied.  That's the only difference between the
two.  So Brahman is the spectator but the Atma is an active participant.
Or so it thinks until the veil of Maya is lifted.  Then there is no
difference between the two.

Each jiva has its own atma.  Otherwise when one person achieved moksha so
would everyone else.  But really all those atmas are not different.  They
are one which only thinks it is different.  When that feeling of
difference goes away, there is no need for ideas such as freedom, not
because freedom doesn't exist but nothing that could make the ever-free
Brahman unfree exists.  While there is that feeling, freedom etc. is
possible but it is not guaranteed to remain.

I think the appeal of Vedanta to some people is the idea that it somehow
absolves you of the need to be moral, make choices etc.  That isn't true.
