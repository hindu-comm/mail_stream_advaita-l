The problem is that the English word God does not directly map to a single
Sanskrit equivalant.  Does God mean Parameshwar or Ishwar?  If the former
than I would agree with you but if the latter it is well known that we in
India worship many different Gods.  The Vedas prescribe the worship of
both for different purposes.  Without further qualification, statements
such as the Vedas teach the worship of one God are highly simplistic and
misleading.

As for one world and one humanity, this is demonstrably false.  Nobody
anywhere thought in these terms until modern times.

There is no historical basis for any of this.  For all of our recorded
history, The Vedas were taught by Brahmans to Brahmans.  Which is not to
say that nothing was taught to others.  That's not what I'm saying.
Puranas, Mahabharata etc. also the products of Rshis containing the
essence of the Vedas are meant for those to whom Vedic study is off-limits
as they themselves explicitly state.  If the Vedas were for all that
entire category of shastra would be redundant.

Why not give some real life examples?  Who were the teacher of Veda to any
old person in the 15th century? how about the 10th? or the 5th?  There
aren't any.

I don't call Mantra japa a pseudo science.  It's some of the more
extravagent claims that are made about energy waves and such which I
object to because this is simply not true.  Moreover it is disrespectful
to the dignity of the mantras to assume they are worthless without a
"scientific" explanation.  Our Grandfathers didn't need any of that.  They
learnt because it was their duty and their tradition and that's all.

I don't disagree with you in the least.  However there are other
sampradayas which are also based on Vedic teachings.  I happen to think
(and I'm sure you'll agree) that Shankaracharya and his followers provide
the best exposition of Vedanta but I would be blind to assume there were
not other interpretations.

In some of those interpretations Mukti is something given by God (who is
seperate to a greater or lesser degree from His creation) at will.  This
is not the Advaita doctrine.

The point of mentioning these things is to show that the Vedas deserve
much closer attention and a keener understanding than the sweeping
suggestions made in the review which was quoted.
