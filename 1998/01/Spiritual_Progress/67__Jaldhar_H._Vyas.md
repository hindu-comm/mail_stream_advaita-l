This is open to debate.

With their fellow Brahmans.  This is something that makes a lot of people
uncomfortable but nevertheless it is true.

Mantras have a spiritual effect.  It's best to leave it at that.  A lot of
this mind-energy channeling talk is just pseudoscience.

The use of the word God with all the connotations the English word carries
may obscure the fact that various Mimamsaka and Vedantic schools have a
range of opinions from completely theistic to somewhat agnostic.  For
Advaita Vedantins God exists and is to be worshipped but Moksha itself is
not something God can give.
