Of course.  The problem is not with the Sanskrit texts but with the
English translations.  That's why we should be extra-careful when reading
those books.  (Ideally we should not rely on them at all.)

I am well aware of that description having given Bhagavata katha
myself once and being a regular reader for my personal practice.
The seven dwipas are from Mt Meru outwards are Jambu (Where Bharat is
located), Plaksha, Shalmala, Kusha, Krauncha, Shaka, and Pushkara dwipas.
However it would be a stretch to say dwipa == continent.  According to the
description, the Earth is flat and all the dwipas are circular in shape
and seperated by oceans of ghee, yoghurt, wine etc.  Even the ancients
knew enough about geography to know that's not true.

Interestingly, I once heard a famous Gujarati preacher of the Bhagavat
Purana, Shri Krshnashankar Shastriji say the 5th Skandha does not refer to
geography at all but is to be understood in esoteric terms as refering to
the human body and yogic practices. Indeed if you read it, many mantras
are given in the course of the descriptions.

It's true that Indians had knowledge of other countries.  But does it
neccessarily indicate "unity of religious thought?"  In Sanskrit works
Yavan (Greek) or Turushka (Turk or Muslim in general) are synonymous with
mleccha or barbarian.  That doesn't sound very complimentary.

Yes but that is not true of all the parts of the Puranas.  For instance I
have the commentary of Shri Bhaskararay on the Lalita Sahasranama which is
a part of the Brahmand Purana and with subcommentaries it is about 400
pages.  Similiarly those few parts of the Vedas I know (our shakha is
Madhyandina Shukla Yajurveda and I know Sandhyavandana, Purusha sukta and
some of Rudri from it) I learnt the traditional way, words first without
meaning but with my general knowledge of Sanskrit I find it pretty easy to
understand most of it.

I would like to know more about this.  It seems highly improbable to me.
