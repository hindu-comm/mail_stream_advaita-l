Note this isn't exactly what we were discussing in the other thread though
the issue is somewhat related.

The traditional view is monolithic.  Several positions can be discerned.

1. Only Brahman men can achieve moksha in this lifetime.
2. Only Dvija men (i.e Brahmans, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas.)
3. Only those who follow Sanatan Dharma (which can be subdivided into
   a.  born Hindus
   b.  Born Hindus plus converts.
4. Anyone.

I tend towards 3a (and not so much because I don't think a convert could,
but because there is no valid way to convert to Hinduism.)  But the real
bottom line is:  I don't care.  I plan to ignore everyone except my elders
and teachers, enlightened or otherwise.
