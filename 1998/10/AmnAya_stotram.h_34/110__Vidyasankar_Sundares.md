The dvArakA maTha is also known as kAlikA maTha, because the Goddess
mentioned here is Bhadrakali.

On the other hand, a number of maThas are known as SAradA maThas, in
addition to the dvArakA and SRngeri maThas. For example, see Sri
Anantanandendra Sarasvati's article in Preceptors of Advaita (ed. T. M. P.
Mahadevan), which reproduces SrImukhams from many other institutions.

My name is Nishant D. Bhatt
        I am a student attending Georgia State University.  I ran
across this web site looking for some research on a research
paper.  Currently I am what we here call "a confuesed desi"
someone who is trying to find the way to better understanding my
culture above the superfical, navratri and holi, level.
Hopefully, I can learn more about what I read and discuss what I
don't understand--or understand--on the board.  I look forward to
hearing from all on the board--
