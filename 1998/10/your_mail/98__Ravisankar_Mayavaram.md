namaste Giri

I checked with the maintainer of the list (who is in Delhi, I
guess) few weeks back. He suggested to me that best is to write
in saMskR^itam. If the questions are addressed in saMskR^itam,
then periyava will directly read and reply it seems. Otherwise,
the answer will be told to one of the attendants and they will
write the reply. If not in saMskR^itam, thamizh the next choice
(probably telugu also).

Thanks for the pointer to starteller site.

With respects,
Ravi
