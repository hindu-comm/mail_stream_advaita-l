150. kachajitAmbudA

SHE whose hair defeats rain clouds in beauty. SHE is vyomakeshI,
hence HER coiffure is above the rain clouds. And in beauty it
puts the rain clouds to shame.

AUM kachajitAmbudAyai namaH

>From  a translation of
shrI shankara bhAshyam of shrI lalita trishatI

Note:

-vyomakeshI is one of the names in shrI lalitA sahasranAma.
It means SHE has sky as HER hair. vyoma can also mean higher
regions like heavens.
