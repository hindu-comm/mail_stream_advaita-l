Is there any internal reference to hanumAn in rudram? Reason
behind this question is this. In one of the talks shrI
chandrasekharendra sarasvatI remarks that the name "vyuptakesha"
(namaH kapardine cha vyuptakeshAya cha)  that occurs in rudram
refers to shankara, because only in that form he come with a
shaven head.

Like this is there something for hanumAn, will the name dUta
(namo dUtAya cha) indicate this?


May Lord shiva who is the best of physicians destroy the worst
of diseases called ignorance that haunts us!

Thank you.

AUM vaidyanAthAya namaH

Note: I think what is deemed as past and present should be a
matter of consideration for shruti. Because it transcends time.
