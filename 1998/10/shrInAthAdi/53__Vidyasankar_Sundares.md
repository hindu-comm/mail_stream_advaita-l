ShrInAtha refers to Narayana, to whom the guru paramparA is traced
(nArAyaNaM padmabhuvaM vasishThaM etc.). In addition to ShrInAthAdi, the
term guru-svarUpa is also significant. In one of the navaratnamAlikA
stotrams, we have,

dayamAna dIrgha nayanAM deSikarUpeNa darsitAbhyudayAM etc.
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is a common aitihya that the Devi manifests in the form of the guru. In
SrIvidyA traditions, an identity between guru and Goddess is very
important.
