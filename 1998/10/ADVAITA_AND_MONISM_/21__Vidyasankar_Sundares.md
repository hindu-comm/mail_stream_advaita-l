The word Goswami is used in a generic sense to refer to Vaishnava leaders.
Some of them are householders and others are monks. For example, the Hindi
poet Tulsidas is often called Goswami Tulsidas. Among the followers of
Caitanya, one counts Rupa and Jiva Goswamis, but I'm not aware of a
lineage of Goswamis in this Vaishnava group. The descendents of Vallabha
are called Goswamis too, and they have a continuing lineage into
contemporary times.
