"Then afterwards I read the chapter titled satguru and see such items
 as :
"Click Here to Become a Monk"
"Telephone Sermonettes:
 If you would like to hear a recorded upadesha, inspired talk, by
Gurudeva, you can call anytime,
 day or night: 808-822-SIVA (822-7482). Upadeshas range from 4 to 18
minutes and tapes are
 changed daily. The phone number above is for Hawaii, USA (country code
is 1). We're sorry that it is not toll-free."

Well our course I have nothing against the fact of phoning one's guru.
Being myself disabled, unable to make any kind of trip, and my own guru
being 80 years old and having very bad health, I am very glad to have
also the possibility of phoning him. But you will notice that on the
site under discussion, the matter is different : it is recorded general
and public teaching. Of course, it most probably does not deal with the
upanishads but with Saiva texts, or the Satguru own ideas and has such
is not shruti and can go on  the telephone lines. But, I must admit I
was surprized to read such things, when I am myself been told not to
(even) read the upanishads. This is why I talked of some archaïsm on the
earlier debate on this matter in the list.
When, on the same site, I am told afterwards how I can become a Hindu,
'I made some marks<<<<<<<<<<< at the proper place, the beginning of
which starts thus :

 The following is excerpted from the new and extraordinary book by
  Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, Loving Ganesha: Hinduism's
 Endearing Elephant-Faced God. You don't deserve to be without it!
    The text below makes reference to certificates which can be
                      photocopied.
    These can be obtained by purchasing the book. You can also
 download and photocopy freely the simple GIF certificates which are
                      linked below.

(I considered this very strict prohibition  as related to the excerpts
given after this copyright mention, and not to the few introduction
lines just here-above). Anyway I stop quoting anything on the subject
"how to become a hindu", as I don't want to be cursed for ever. Being
cursed by a Saiva satguru must  be specially frightful.


well reading all this,

YES, Giridhar, I must confess, I really started to ask myself some
questions (and this was the reason for the posting to which you
reacted), even if I know how deep we have fallen into Kali Yuga, the
age of among  far worst other things, flying svAmis, jet set sAdhus, and
New Age "soap vedanta".

Now, if you and some others members of the list, which I consider as
having some common sense tell me the works of the mentioned svAmi are
really serious and worth reading, no doubt I shall possibly try (if the
contents are within the scope of my own quest and svadharma) and submit
them to the tests of vedantic truth as taught by SRI SACCIDANANDA
SIVABHINAVA NARASIMHA BHARATI MAHASVAMI, SHANKARACHARYA OF SRINGERI
(1878-1912) to RAJASEVASAKTA SRI V. SUBRAHMANIA IYER, who seems to have
been totally forgotten, and was perhaps never known at all  apart from
his  students, and some happy fews (among whom I feel myself very
blessed to be).

With reverence and respects,

Guy
