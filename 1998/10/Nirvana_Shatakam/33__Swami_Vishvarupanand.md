Here an English translation:

Six Stanzas on Nirvana
by Adi Shankaracarya

1
Om, I am neither the mind,
nor intellect, ego, nor thoughts,
Neither the ears nor the tongue,
nor the nose nor the eyes;
Neither ether nor earth,
nor fire nor air;
I am Shiva in the form of
Consciousness-Bliss, I am Shiva!

2
I am neither prana (the breath of life)
nor the five vital airs,
Neither the seven components
of the body, nor its five sheaths,
Neither speech, nor hands, nor feet, nor the generative organ,
nor the anus.
I am Shiva in the form of
Consciousness-Bliss, I am Shiva!

3
Neither aversion nor clinging have I, nor greed nor delusion;
Neither arrogance nor jealousy,
Neither duty nor purpose, nor desire, nor liberation.
I am Shiva in the form of
Consciousness-Bliss, I am Shiva!

4
Neither virtue nor vice,
nor happiness, nor misery,
Neither mantra, nor sacred place,
nor the vedas nor sacrifice;
Neither enjoyment,
nor the object of enjoyment,
nor the enjoyer am I.
I am Shiva in the form of
Consciousness-Bliss, I am Shiva!

5
Neither death nor fear,
nor birth nor growth,
Neither father, nor mother,
nor birth have I,
Neither relative, nor friend,
nor guru nor disciple.
I am Shiva in the form of
 Consciousness-Bliss, I am Shiva!

6
I am changeless, bodiless, omnipresent, everywhere, pervading all the
senses. Established in eternal equanimity, I know neither liberation nor
bondage.
I am Shiva in the form of
Consciousness-Bliss, I am Shiva!
