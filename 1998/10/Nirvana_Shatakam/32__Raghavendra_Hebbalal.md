That seems to be right and I think Sri Srinivasan who initially requested this
wanted to know about the nirvANa shaTka and not the nirvANa shataka. I do not
know when Sri Shankara composed the nirvANa shaTka. Does any composition
named nirvANa shataka exist under the name of Sri Shankara ?

Thank you,
Raghavendra.

Yes, indeed, it's the manIshA pa.ncakam if my memory serves me right.
The dashashlokI, if I remember right, was sung by Sha.nkara when
GovindabhagavatpAda, his guru asked who he was.
