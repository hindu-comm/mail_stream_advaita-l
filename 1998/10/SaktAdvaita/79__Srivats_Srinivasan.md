  Austin doesn't have a traditional temple yet. It has an ashram about 30
mins. drive from downtown. As for the University library, yes there are a
lot of books on Indian philosophy on almost all Indian languages. San Antonio
temple is a very nice temple. The archakas are well versed in vedas,
though I cannot say if you and I are talking of the same archakas.
