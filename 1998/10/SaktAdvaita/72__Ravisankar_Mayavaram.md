In the book "Dancing with Siva" by shrI shivAya subramuniya
svAmi, there is a reference to something called "shiva-advaita".
Not much detail is given there though. Author talks about
"shrI appaya dIkshita" in this regard.

I have not heard anything about shAktAdvaita. I am able
understand only what shiva-vishishtAdvaita (shrIkaNTha) or
shaktI-vishishTAdvaita can possibly mean. In the realm of
advaita-vedanta there is very little or no scope for difference
between shiva, shaktI and shrIman nArAyaNa.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

With respects
Ravi
