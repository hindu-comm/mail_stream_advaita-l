Greetings Ravi:

Your reply to Shri Guy Werlings truly reveals your strong convictions
and beliefs. Those who actively engaged in preserving Vedas  have good
intentions and they also have strong faith on the role of Ishvara. It is
very difficult for anyone to make judgements on the true attitude of
others because TRUTH is Self-revealed!  Logic and beliefs are always
interconnected and consequently logic can be established to support
individual beliefs.  However, such logic will not be acceptable to
everyone because different people have different beliefs.  Those who
have strong convictions like you may also ready to forgo the logic that
comes directly comes out of your own belief.  You should be able to
understand the logical problem in the above paragraph of your reply to
Shri Guy Werlings: If we have strong conviction that Amabal is the cause
of everything, then the Vedas in printed form is also caused by the same
Ambal! In fact, the Kartha of everything including the attitude which
undermines the role of Ishvara is also due to the Grace of Amabal!  At
one time, you seem to imply that we are all "Vilaiyattu Bommai -
Mechanical Toys operated by Ambal" and at the same time you appear to
show your dissatisfaction with some of the actions of Ambal which become
contradictory to your subjective beliefs! It is easy for someone else to
point the finger to you and ask:  "Don't you selectively choose to
believe according to your convenience?"

Finger pointing is  an easy task and quick reactions and simple answers
will always have a shorter life span.  The more we contemplate and
think, we can understand others' concerns and complexity of issues.   To
be consistent with the belief that, "Ambal is the cause of everything"
is to accept everything that is happening around us.  Vedas in printed
form, Vedas in Internet, Vedas in Email messages, Advaita and Advaitin
Lists, Vedas  translated in different languages correctly and
incorrectly, Pujas conducted correctly and incorrectly, Vedas pronounced
correctly and incorrectly and so on and on.  When we choose on our own
to accept some, reject some and  debate on few, we contradict our own
beliefs.   If you feel that this posting is an attempt to ridicule your
statements, I want to assure you, that  I do not like to ridicule you.
On the contrary, I admire your strong conviction and beliefs.  You have
devoted a significant amount of your time in managing this scholarly
list and I am aware  that your reply to Shri Guy Werlings is with good
intentions.  But when you accept that it is HER problem then you to STOP
questioning and judging the actions and the actors.  Actors and actions
are illusions and there can be no questions and there can be no answer!
SHE knows the question and SHE has the answer!

Hello Guy,

As far as I know and from my understanding of Mahasannidhanams words
restrictions apply only to actual recitation of the passages. Merely
looking at them and also reading translations seem to be fine. I think
Giri made this clear also. Please do read the posts by Anand, they are
very good indeed! Also please post your series which you were planning
on posting. I, for one, am interested in reading about it.

Rama
