Yes, you are right. Historically speaking, there is a SivAdvaita school
associated with the name of the great appayya dIkshita. He wrote works
like SivArkamaNidIpikA and SivAdvaita-nirNaya, as also the parimalA
commentary in the bhAmatI sub-school in advaita vedAnta. He reinterprets
SrIkaNTha's version of viSishTAdvaita along the lines of Sankaran advaita.

Re: SAktAdvaita, one could possibly count authors like bhAskararAya (16th
century), who wrote on various SAkta traditions and texts. However, if we
hold a commentary on the brahmasUtra to be necessary for a school to be
called vedAnta, one cannot call bhAskararAya a vedAntin. Most of these
SAkta authors also tend to refer to SankarAcArya's commentaries and hymns
with great respect, so that their SAktAdvaita is derivative of advaita
vedAnta, in some senses.
