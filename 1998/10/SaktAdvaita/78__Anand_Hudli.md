  While we're on this subject, does Austin have a traditional
  temple now? I visited Austin a few times during 1993-1996.
  The University library has a truly spectacular collection of
  books on all aspects of Indian philosophy and religion, and
  Sanskrit literature. I remember San Antonio, which isn't too far,
  had a nice temple with a couple of learned archakas. Are they still
  with the temple? I think they can teach portions of the Vedas.

 Anand
