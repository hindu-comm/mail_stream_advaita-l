149. kalAnAthamukhI

SHE whose face resembles the moon. kalAnatha means moon.

This name can be interpreted in another way. kala indicates the
64 kala-s. From shruti it is known that R^ik, yajus and sAma veda
were breathed out by brahmn. That is, brahman is the source. It
is also established in brahma sUtra that brahman is the source.
kalAnAtha means one who inspires the kala-s. SHE as the source of
all shAstra-s inspires them. Hence, this name reveals HER as
brahman.
