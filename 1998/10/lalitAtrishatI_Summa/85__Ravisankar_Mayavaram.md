In which case you should find the "Indian Embassy" in France also rather
amusing, I suppose :-). Just as the Indian embassy in France is to
represent India, I would presume that the Himalayan Academy is to spread
the glory of the person residing in the Himalayas - namely shiva. That
is in fact, the purpose of their organization. I think we need not fear
too much about offending Plato regarding this terminology (what
objection he may have had I don't know).

Perhaps not too exhausting. Though I fail to see what it has to do with
his teachings. Maybe he should participate in some Ironman triathalons
to exhaust himself perhaps?

I know they call themselves the Saiva Siddhanta Church, which sounds
slightly awkward. I have read some chapters in the book mentioned by
Ravi in the bookstore, and it's a nice book, encylopaedic, so you can't
really expect it to go into the nitty-gritty on every thing. He is also
quite faithful the the shaiva tradition of Tamil Nadu, and was initiated
by a yogi of the same line, I am led to believe. He also does not try to
deliver some hodge-podge like some I have seen, which you may expect
because of the word "church". And his organization does not
systematically degrade other Hindu traditions like some other
so-called-vedic organizations based in the West. All in all, I think we
can appreciate the good swami for spreading the cause of shiva-bhakti in
a nice manner.

And if we can believe emails on this list, why not the good Swami? I
think we can credit him with some basic common-sense, which is all we
need for writing a precis of Appayya Dixitar's contributions.

Rama.
