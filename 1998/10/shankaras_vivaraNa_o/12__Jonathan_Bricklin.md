Vidyasankar Sundares writes:

"In any case, this complex argument is what leaves room for some later
authors to say that upanishads enjoin it, and for others to say that the
upanishads do not enjoin anything. And both sides can quote Sankara
selectively. "

Do you not think that a line can be drawn between in both the Upanishads and
Shankara's writings between description and prescription?  Assigning an
absolute value to descriptions of ultimate reality, and a relative value to
prescriptions on how to get there?

Jonathan
