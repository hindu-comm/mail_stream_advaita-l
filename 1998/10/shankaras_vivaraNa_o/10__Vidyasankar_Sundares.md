Is this Subbaramaiah's translation? It seems like an unfortunate choice of
words. Those used to pUrva mImAMsA (their ranks are few in total number,
but not negligible in the academic community) attach a technical meaning
to injunction. Note that the original bhAshya quotation does not use the
term "vidhi," but only says "vihita".

The more I read, the more I am absolutely convinced that sureSvarAcArya's
texts are essential reading for anybody interested in any way in
SankarAcArya. It is a pity that the academic community that discusses the
authenticity of Sankara's works or the internal consistency of his thought
has not paid sufficient attention to his close disciple.

Needless to say, SankarAcArya and sureSvarAcArya *recommend* yogAbhyAsa,
but do not interpret Sruti as *enjoining* it in the mImAMsA sense of
injunction.

145. kAmasa.njIvinI

SHE who rejuvenated kAma.

kAma was burnt down to ashes by parameshvara when he tried to
tempt the lord with by shooting his arrows of desire. From the
ashes, bhaNDAsura came out and he troubled all the worlds from
time to time. ratidevI, wife of kAma, to save her husband prayed
to paradevatA and performed austerities like penance. Pleased
with the prayers, paradevatA revived kAma to original body with
the nectar of HER compassionate look and granted him boons.
