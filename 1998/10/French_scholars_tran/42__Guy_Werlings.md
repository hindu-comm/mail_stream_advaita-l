 Namaste !

I agree with all the arguments of SrI Subhanu Saxena also. I was just
trying to type very slowly (because nearly everybody on the list now
knows that I am disabled) some further ideas on the same subject when
the above message from SrI Ravi was received.

Now what is your final conclusion, Ravi ? That all scholars should stop
publising and should perish instead ? Perhaps would it be as a fact more
safe for the pure tradition. In any case, I feel just glad not to have
become a scholar myself (thus not obliged to choose between "publish or
perish"), and I am stupidly satisfied that my only endeavour has been
and is still to try to do all what I can to be a good adhikAri and a
good sAdhaka in my next life.

With all respects,

Guy
