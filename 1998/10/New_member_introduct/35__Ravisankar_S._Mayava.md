Subject: Re: your mail

Namaste,
 I am mailing this in response to your request to introduce my self to the
list.
 Well I am P. Hari Krishna, presently doing my M.Tech(CS) in KREC,
surathkal India, and .
 Though not a very regular reader of vedanta books, I take a keen interest
in Advaita Vedanta. I read Bhagavad Gita and also the teachings of Swami
Vivekananda. Very recently I came accross the Web site of Advaita Vedanta
and so this mailing list.
 AS you too mentioned in your mail, I would like to know more about
Bhakti in advaita vedanta apart from other interesting discussios.
Thank You
Hari Krishna
