namaste

I do not belong to their ashram or their organization, so I have
no personal benefit in what I am going to say. I have written few
times with questions to the svAmiji and he took his time to
answer them and bless me.  svAmiji is also engaged in building a
traditional temple (out of stone) for Lord shiva in kauai
AdhInam (Hawaii). I sincerely wish to  meet him once personally
and do a namaskAram to him.

Getting to subject. is there a connection between
pashu-pati-pAsham of shaiva siddhAnta and
jIva-brahman-mAyA of advaita-vedAnta?

with respects to all,
Ravi
