 Excellent post by Subhanu.

 One of the important differences between R^ig Vedic chanting and
 kR^iShNa yajurvedic chanting styles is the how the svarita affects
 the syllable. In the R^ig Veda, the svarita has the effect of
 elongating the vowel, if it is a short vowel. If the vowel is
 dIrgha, then the svarita causes it to become a "dIrgha-svarita"
 (marked by a double vertical bar). Take, for example, the verse
 from the shrI rudram that also occurs in the R^ig Veda:

 stuhi shrutaM gartasadaM yuvAnaM mR^igaM na bhImamupahatnumugram.h |
 mR^iLA jaritre rudra stavAno .anyaM te asmanni vapantu senAH  ||

 The svarita for mu, for example,  in "bhImamupahatnumugram" makes it
 sound like "mU" (dIrgha) in R^ig Vedic style but it sounds like "mu"
 in kR^ishna Yajurvedic style. Again, the svarita for vA in yuvAnaM
 and in stavAno, are in the R^ig Veda, chanted as dIrgha-svarita,
 but ordinary svarita in the kR^iShNa yajur Veda.

 Personally, I feel the R^ig Vedic style adds a pleasing effect to
 the chanting and makes it more melodious. And the more melodious
 a chant is the more the probability that you will remember it!
 But this may be just  because I am used to chanting and hearing
 more of R^ig Veda than kR^iShNa yajur veda. When I started learning
 kR^iShNa yajur vedic portions, I had some difficulty in adjusting to
 the new style. I think the best way to become familiar with
 kR^iShNa yajur vedic chanting style is start with the taittirIya
 upaniShad. This introduces the student to the chanting style with
 (relatively) easy mantras.

 Curiously enough, the shukla yajur veda (at least the kANva shAkhA)
 follows a chanting style that is similar to R^ig Veda. For example,
 the  mantra "imA rudrAya tavase kapardine..." of the shrI Rudram is
 chanted _identically_ in both the R^ig and shukla Yajur Vedas.
 In that respect, I found chanting the shukla yajur vedic Rudram/
 chamakam easier to me at least.

 The objections, I have heard, come from the mImAmsakas.
 But I find the ghanapATha a remarkable experience to listen to.
 I have not learnt this scheme but have only heard chants from others.

 I completely agree that it is important to learn to chant even
 a little of a Veda correctly rather than do a poor job of learning
 large portions. In fact, the gAyatrI mantra of the daily sandhyA-
 vandana is all that one needs to chant perfectly to derive the
 benefit of learning all the Vedas! The taittirIya brAhmaNa
 states so. More about this later.
