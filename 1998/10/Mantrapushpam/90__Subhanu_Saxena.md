I noticed the underlining of anudatta didn't seem to work in the posting. If
anybody knows how to do this, please let me know, and I will will repost.
It shouldn't affect the content of the posting, except where somebody wants
to follow the swara changes in different styles of recitation.

Regards

Subhanu
