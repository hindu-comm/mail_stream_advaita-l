Ma. Ka. II 35-37 pretty explicitly says renunciation is the path followed
by those who know the self. III 1 excludes upasana as a means to knowledge
too calling those whose jnana is confined to the sagunabrahman (i.e.
jnanakarmasamucchayavadins) as pitiful as those practice only karma.  III
39-40 describes the yoga "known" as asparshayoga (implying it is known by
other names too.) as being impossible for those who have not controlled
their mind. IV 94, echoes the theme of III 1.  Those who believe in causes
and effects (i.e karma -- even if combined with jnana) are pitiful.

All in all this is pretty strong evidence Gaudapadacharya is teaching
sannyasa and Shankaracharya only interprets the karikas this way.

This is the same old FAQ that keeps popping up on the list.  If Sannyasa
is the only path to Moksha how do you explain, Vidura, Janaka etc.  We've
already gone over that ad nauseam.

Shankaracharya has abandoned all the special terminology of
Gaudapadacharya.  However the meaning and emphasis seems to me to be the
same.

But sannyasa is not defined as wearing ochre robes, carrying danda etc.
It is defined as the total renunciation of karma.

That in itself doesn't prove anything.  These New Age types have an
annoying ability to believe several contradictory things.

It was asparshavadin vs asparshayogin.  And while there may not be a
grammatical mistake, it does sound wrong given the conventional meanings
of the words vada and yoga.

Most books have at least _something_ good to say, it's just the proportion
of good to bad varies a lot. :-)  The description in the URL Guy gave
didn't inspire much confidence is all I'm saying.
