 I am sorry for the delay in posting the Rudram verses. Due to
 a job-related emergency, I was unable to find any spare time
 at all for the last couple of weeks. I will be more diligent
 (or less delinquent) in working on the Rudram in the forthcoming
 month of kArtika, which is also held to be sacred for Shiva-worship.

 Anand
