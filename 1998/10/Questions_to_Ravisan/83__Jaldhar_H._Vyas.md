Other peoples beliefs are not at all important for how one practices ones
own.

I'm afraid it is you have misunderstood the problem.  The problem is not
printed editions of the Vedas exist.  They have existed since at least the
10th century and probably earlier.  The problem is that printed texts are
of _no_value_ in comparison to learning them from the mouth of a Sadguru
because She Herself has proclaimed it to be so through her shastras.  All
things are created by Mataji but they are not created with equal worth.
If your employers were to replace your paycheck with horse manure I wonder
what kind of mystical reaction we would get from you!

No, a Bhakta is a dasa or servent of God.  A Bhakta serves God not because
he is forced like a mechanical toy but because he _wants_ to. Out of love
he asks "what does my Bhagavan command?  What more can I do?"  And
Bhagavans wishes are clearly expressed in the shastras.

Ambaji has also caused the war in Kosovo where many innocent people are
getting slaughtered.  Shouldn't we be dissatisfied with that?  Your
thinking lies prostrate in the presence of evil and hence is evil itself.

No we believe according to the dictates Shruti, Smrti and Shistachara.

The Vedic tradition has lasted thousands of years and is still going
strong.  Your silly modern ideas won't last beyond your lifetime.

When you put the rhetoric aside, you don't accept everything happening
around you so why should anyone else?

So why did you write this post then?  You're contradicting your own
beliefs.

And She has told us the answer.  You are acting like a man who keeps his
eyes tightly shut and then complains it's dark.

On this day of Diwali may Mataji bless Ravi and his family and all those
like him who strive to do the right thing despite the atheists who plague
the Kaliyuga.
