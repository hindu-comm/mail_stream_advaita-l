Namaste Ravi ! Don't worry, you didn't break my window. On the contrary,
you gave me good food for thought, as one says commonly in the States if
I was well informed.

Same for me, as you probably saw from my tendency to enquire repeatedly.

Certainly not, Ravi. Why should I do such a thing ? I consider you as a
most honest and staunch seeker from whom I can learn a lot and get
stimulation and emulation (French "émulation", which is in no case
"rivalry", (as rhe Harrap's says) but a mutual incentive towards the
same goal). On top of that, as you know I studied the MANDUKya kArikA
quite a lot, even if I was not entitled. And my personal admiration and
respect for SrI GauDapAdAcarya knows no limit since I read and meditated
the kArikAs III.17-18. If we advaitins cannot clash with dualists, how
could we clash with one another or do any harm to one another. This was
pointed out to me several times by my vedAnta teacher, and was earlier
pointed out to rAjasevAsakta SrI V. subrahmanya Iyer by his own Guru,
SrI Jagadguru Sivabhinava Narasimha Bharati MahasvAmigal of SrI Sringeri
SAradA PItham, on their very first meeting, before the turn of this
century. (see VSI's illuminating foreword to the translation of
the MANDUkyopanishad published by SrI Râmakrishna Asrama Mysore, 5th
edition 1955).
