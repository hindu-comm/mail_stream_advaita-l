Interestingly enough Bhatta Bhaskara, a younger contemporary of
Shankaracharya (his philosophy never went anywhere and is extinct now.)
thought the Gita should be off-limits to women and Shudras precisely for
the reasons Guy mentions.

But that is a minority view.  We believe that out of mercy for those who
have no right to hear te Vedas, Vyas Maharshi took the essence of the
Vedic teachings and wrote the 18 puranas and the Mahabharata which
includes the Gita as a part.

So it is ok for everyone as you say.
