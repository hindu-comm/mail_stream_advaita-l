Namaste

Does anybody can give me more details about Yajnavalkya, the central
character of the second kandam of the Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad.

Is there any other reliable sources from where i can learn other biographic
details on that great Rishi?
For example :
- Who was his own guru?
- When and how does he himself reached Moksha?
- Apart from Janaka and Maitreyi, did he had others known disciples?
- Is the Uddalaka Aruni defeated in the Brihad Aranyaka Up by Yajnavalkya
the same person than the Uddalaka Aruni of the Chandogya Up ?
- ...etc

Thanks in advance for any contribution on that topic from the most learned
persons of this list.

Yann (from France)
