Namaste Ramaji,

Is there any information in the tradition as to whom the Upanishads were
revealed to? I believe the Samhita/Brahmana have references to the Mantra
Drashta but what about the Upanishads. Please enlighten. 

Kathir

At least from the point of view of advaita and the puurva miimaa.msaa, the
stories related in "sruti are NOT historical events and are meant for only
purposes of illustration. So this whole discussion is moot from an advaitic
standpoint.

The stories in puraa.na-s and the itihaasa-s may or may not correspond to
actual events.

"In the Br.Up is contained a discussion between sage yagyavalkya and janaka.
This is not a narration connected with individuals who might have lived in a
certain period. ... The stories in the vedas are meant only to illustrate
certain aspects"

>From "The Jagadguru Replies", page 89.
