At least from the point of view of advaita and the puurva miimaa.msaa,
the stories related in "sruti are NOT historical events and are meant
for only purposes of illustration. So this whole discussion is moot
from an advaitic standpoint.

The stories in puraa.na-s and the itihaasa-s may or may not correspond
to actual events.

"In the Br.Up is contained a discussion between sage yagyavalkya and
janaka. This is not a narration connected with individuals who might
have lived in a certain period. ... The stories in the vedas are meant
only to illustrate certain aspects"
