Namaste

In the entire Indian tradition, all SannyAsis take up (or
are given) a new name at the time of SannyAsa. What was the
pre-sannyAsa name of Adi Shankaracharya? If the name given
to him by his parents was 'Shankara', as all accounts seem
to say, then, was there no change of name at the time of
formal initiation into SannyAsa by his guru
Govinda-bhagavat-pAda?

PraNAms to all students of Adi Shankaracharya.
