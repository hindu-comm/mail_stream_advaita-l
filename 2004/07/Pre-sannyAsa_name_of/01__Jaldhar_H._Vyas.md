Shankaracharya was the founder of the Dashanami order of Sannyasis so
presumably rules such as changing ones name were started by him and
applied to those who came after him.  Are there any pre-shankaran
instances of people changing their name upon taking sannyasa?  I can't
think of any off-hand.  The upanishadic sages do not seem to have done so.
