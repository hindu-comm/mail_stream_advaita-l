You can search our archives at http://www.escribe.com/religion/advaita/. It
is a backup and it sometimes misses messages; and recently it was down for a
while. But you can take a shot at it. Main problem with searching is we do
not have a consistent transliteration scheme.

See the following message for the reference:
