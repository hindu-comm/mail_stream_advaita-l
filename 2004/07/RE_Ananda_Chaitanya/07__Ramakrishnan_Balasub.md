Just like the example I gave - sacchidaananda bharatii, the aananda
suffix occurs in the middle, not at the end. I am not aware of any
sannyaasins with names aananda at the end initiated at "s.rngeri. Most
seem to be bhaaratii or tiirtha even in modern times.

"Sa.mkaraananda sarasvatii never occupied the "s.rngeri seat. He is
not mentioned in the list provied by the ma.tha.
