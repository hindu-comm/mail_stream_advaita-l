Some of them do have aananda, though not at the end, e.g.,
saccidaananda bhaaratii. Since aananda is not a da"sanaamii suffix,
perhaps it is not taken at the end by traditional da"sanaamii
sanyaasins. aananda has probably been popularized by the RK Mission,
Chinmaya mission, etc.

The suffix aa"srama also nominally come under "s.r.ngeri, but no
aacaarya in the "s.r.ngeri list has that as the title. Most in the
list seemed to be bhaaratii, followed by tiirtha. A couple of giris
and only one aara.nya.
