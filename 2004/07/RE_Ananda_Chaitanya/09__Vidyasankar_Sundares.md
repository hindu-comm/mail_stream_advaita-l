To clarify,

Ananda is not added as another suffix in addition to the ten names marking 
the daSanAmI tradition. It can be explained like a first name and surname. 
For example, the current AcAryas of the Dwaraka and Puri mathas are called 
Swarupananda Sarasvati and Nischalananda Sarasvati. The titular suffix 
(surname) is Sarasvati only, not Ananda and not Ananda Sarasvati. The first 
names in each case are Swarupananda and Niscalananda.

The usage of Ananda in the first name is indeed quite old, e.g. the author 
of kalpataru, the commentary on bhAmatI, was called Amalananda (13th 
century). And there was Anandagiri, whose guru was called Shuddhananda,and 
who was the author of numerous subcommentaries on the SAnkara bhAshyas. 
However, it is also true that Ananda seems to have become much more popular 
recently, because of the large numbers of monks initiated within the more 
newly established institutions like the Ramakrishna Math, Divine Life 
Society, Chinmaya Mission etc.
