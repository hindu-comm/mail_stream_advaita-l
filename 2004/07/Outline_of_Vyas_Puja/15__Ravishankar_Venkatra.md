I think so too. Many of you may be aware of Avadootha Dattapeetham founded 
by Sri ganapathy Sacchidananda Swami. Recently His Holiness gave sanyasa to 
a successor, who performed His first Vyasa pooja.

They seem to be following another panchaka called Dattatreya Panchaka.

Dattatreya Panchaka - In Datta Peetham tradition Bhagawan Dattatreya, 
Bhargava Rama, Shanta Tapa, Sri Pada Vallabha and Narasimha Saraswati are 
the important Gurus.

It would be nice to know what other Sankara mutts follow in terms of local 
traditions.

Thanks,
Ravi
