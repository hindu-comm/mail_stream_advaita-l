Namasthey all

I want to know the exact correct meaning of "uttarayana death" preferably as explained either in Bhagavat Gita or by Adi Sankara. 

I read somewhere that its meaning  is not exactly the same as all deaths during the Tamil months between Thai to Aani.. If it is so, why did Bhishmar waited (through his boon power) till Uttarayana  period (Thai month to come) before he died... or some other reasons ?

Pl help
Thanks
