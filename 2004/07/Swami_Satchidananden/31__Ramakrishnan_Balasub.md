But I do agree with his analysis of avidyaa/maayaa as used by
"sa.mkara. :-). I have not read the two you mention below, but his
other books along with re-reading passages from "sa.mkaras work was
convincing enough :-).

That said, I diagree with one particular point, which I will post
later. I don''t have the time to post a lengthy mail right now. But I
do agree with his analysis that maayaa and avidyaa are _not_ used
interchangeably.

The book is not with me, i cannot quote from it, but i have seen, read it at many places.   the entire 3 chapter deserves our attention in this regard.
