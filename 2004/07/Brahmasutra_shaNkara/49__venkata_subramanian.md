As rightly marked by Stig, Karyalaya has not published any English Translation of the Commentary on the first 4 Sutras.  i think Sri Rama is mentioning about the Kannada Translation.

In the booklet "Shankara's Sutra Bhashya (Self explained), one can find that the Swamiji had a plan to write an original commentary on the first 4 sutras explaining the Bhashya, but it did not come out beyong a part of the Adhyasa Bhashya.

Further, to those who are interested, i learn that the Swamiji has written a part translation of the Kena Upanishad also into English (uncomplete) unpublished.

Swami Sivananda's translation is quite good. The problem is that his
style of English makes it a difficult read.

I suggest buying Swami Gambhiranandas translation instead. It's not
available on the web. But it's a paltry sum, at least if you buy it in
India, only about Rs 200 or so. The Sanskrit original is available
from many sources including Motilal. I use the Vani Vilas edition
published by Samata books. The font size is bigger and easier on the
eyes. I have found the Swamijis translation to be very good for all
the sutras I have read so far. His translation of the 8 principal
upanishads is also quite outstanding.

Swami Satchidanandendra Saraswati has produced a very good translation
of the first four suutras along with the original and a lucid
commentary on the bhaa.sya. If anyone's interested, I can dig up the
details of this book.
