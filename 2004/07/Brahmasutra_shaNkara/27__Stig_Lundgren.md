Dear Rama,

I didnÂ´t know of this, and the authorities at Adhyatma Prakasha
Karyalya have never mentioned any such translation in their
correspondence with me. I would be most grateful to learn more
about this English translation. I believe there is a translation
into Kannada made by Satchidanandendra Swamiji, but I have never
heard of anyone into English.

Warmest regards
Stig Lundgren
