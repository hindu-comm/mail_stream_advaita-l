Namaste.

Swami Krishnaananda ji did not write Brahma Sutras commentary of Sri 
Shankara. Instead, he wrote 'An analysis of the Brahmasutra' at his site. At 
the same site, Brahma Sutras of Sri Shankara bhasyam, written by sri Swami 
Sivananada ji, is also found, and it is free. This is the one I was refering 
to.

Namaste
Babu
