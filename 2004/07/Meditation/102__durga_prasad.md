I  am interested in doing meditation.
Can you suggest me any book or other resource that tells me
-- how to do meditation, practical steps
-- what is that I am expected to achieve by doing meditation
-- what is the ultimate goal of meditation
Looking forward to your advise.
Thank you
Regards
-- Durga Prasad
