Namaste,

In addition to the books suggested, which I have not seen,
may I recommend

Sri Rudram and Chamakam by T.R. Rajagopala Iyer, published
by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 3rd edition, 1999?

I have enjoyed reading this book and I keep it as my
constant companion on the Rudram. It has a general
introduction, word-by-word meanings, several parallel
meanings and a discussion of the different contexts of
interpretation. 

PraNAms to all students of Sri Rudram.
