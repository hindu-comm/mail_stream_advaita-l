namasthe,

  Can someone explain whether its allowed to hold the yagnopaveetham while doing
sandhyavandhanam (Gayathri Japam) ? I heard from someone recently that we 
should not hold and we should only keep the palms facing face, heart and naabhi 
during morning, noon and evening. 

namasthe
Prasad
