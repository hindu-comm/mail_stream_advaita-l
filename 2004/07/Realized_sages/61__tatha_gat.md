Namaste.

In recent times, Ramana Maharshi was universally acknowledged as a person who has realized the ultimate truth. (I am sure there were others also, but please excuse my ignorance) In similar vein, I would like to know about a living person  who is widely believed to be self realized.

Thanks.
