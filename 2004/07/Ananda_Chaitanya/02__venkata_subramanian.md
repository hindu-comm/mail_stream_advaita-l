Apropos to this,

Sringeri Math tradition says that for Brahmacharis the title is Chaitanya and upon Samnayasa it is Ananda.

But this does not seem to be followed even in Sringeri.   While anyone who gets Samnyasa from Sringeri is givne the title of Ananda.....the Acharyas themselves perse have not adhered to this suffix of Ananda.   Right from the Adi Acharya to the present one.

Why ?

Further, is there any brahmacharya inititation by that Math other than the Upanayana, i dont know.   if there is a one like that, do they award the title "chaitanya" ?!

regards,
venkat.

Shankaracharya was the founder of the Dashanami order of Sannyasis so
presumably rules such as changing ones name were started by him and
applied to those who came after him. Are there any pre-shankaran
instances of people changing their name upon taking sannyasa? I can't
think of any off-hand. The upanishadic sages do not seem to have done so.
