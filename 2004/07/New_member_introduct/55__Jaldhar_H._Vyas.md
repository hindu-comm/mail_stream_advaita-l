Jaya Jaya Sankara Hara Hara Sankara!

Namaste!

I am Bharathi from Chennai. I have
completed my P.G. and working in Chennai
in a Private Company.

I am very much interested in learning
Divine Religious books, articles, stories
etc.  Recently I have heard about Matru
Panchakam, the composition of our
Great Adisankara and wondered at the
meaning.  I wanted to read it and the
meaning of it.  When I was searching for
the meaning of it in website, by name
Adisankarar, found your website. Hence
I wished to join the group.

I hope the above introduction is sufficient.
If you could give me the meaning of
Matru Panchakam, if possible, word by
word, I would feel very happy.

Yours sincerely,

Bharathi.

Jaya Jaya Sankara! Hara Hara Sankara!
