Hello,
	This is Raghavendra a smartha brahmin belonging to Gauthamas gothra,
affiliated to Sringeri Shankara Mutt. I would like to know more about
advaita-vedAnta to reinforce my current understanding of the same and to
correlate the same with modern physics [ I understand several people have
made attempts to do this correlation, I would like to do my bit of work ].

thanks & regards,
Raghavendra H.
