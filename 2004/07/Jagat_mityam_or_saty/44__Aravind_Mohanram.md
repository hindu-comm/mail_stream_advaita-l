Dear Members,

I came across two verses, one in Brhadaranyaka Up. (II.1.20) and another Maitri Up. (6.32) that seem to indicate that this world is not false (as understood from Brahma satyam jagat mitya phrase), but it is satya but in a derivative sense (satyasya satya or Truth of Truth). So, my question is, is there a contradiction here, if yes, how do we reconcile these? 

Thanks,

Aravind.
