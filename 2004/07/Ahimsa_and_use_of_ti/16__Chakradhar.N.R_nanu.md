Hi,
  Advaita philosophy preaches the principle of
'Ahmisa'. The Acharyas are supposed to follow the
principle of Ahimsa during 'Chaturmasya'. How come
then that most of the Acharyas use either deer/tiger
skin as 'asana'. Does this not indirectly endorse the
cruel act of killing these animals?
Looking forward to the answers from the erudite
members in the list...

Regards,
-Chakra
