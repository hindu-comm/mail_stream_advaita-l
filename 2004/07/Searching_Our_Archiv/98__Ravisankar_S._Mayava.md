These days our escribe archives is often down. An alternate way to search
our archives is using Google. All you have to do is limit the search just to
our site. For instance the following will search only pages inside
advaita-vedanta.org and for the keyword (svarita or swarita).

svarita OR swarita site:advaita-vedanta.org

This search will get files from our archives and also if available from
other parts of our site.


Thanks

Ravi
