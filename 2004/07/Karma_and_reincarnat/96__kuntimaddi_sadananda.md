Maria Dickson - To understand the basis concepts of Vedanta, " Manual of
Self-Unfoldment" by Swami Chinmyananda is a good book. Most of the
Chinmya Study groups follow this book before they embark more serious
study of the scriptures.  The book can be order on line through Chinmaya
Publications located in PA.  One can obtain the web site address through
Search engine.

What you have is destiny and what you do with what you have is self-effort. Future destiny is post destiny modified by your present action. You are not only the prisoner of your past but master of your future. - Swami Chinmayananda
