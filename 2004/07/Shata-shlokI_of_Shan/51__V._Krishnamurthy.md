nAsIt-pUrvaM na pashcAt atanu-dina-karAc-chAdako vAri-vAhaH

vAri-vAhaH : The cloud
atanu-dina-kara-AcchAdakaH : that hides the huge Sun
nAsIt pUrvaM : has not existed ever before
na pashcAt : nor (will exist) ever thereafter
dRshyaH kintu antaraH : but is visible during that
interval.
saH sthagayati : It obstructs
pashyataH dRshaM : the vision of the spectator
na arka-bimbaM : and not the solar orb;
tarhi evam no cet :  For if it were not so, 
kasmAt jala-dhara-paTalam bhAsate : how can  the group of
clouds be visible
vinA arkaM : without the Sun?
tadvat : In the same manner
vishvaM vidhatte dRshaM : does the  (appearance of the)
universe veil the vision
atha na paraM : but not the Supreme Self 
bhAsakaM cAlakaM svaM : which is its own illuminer and
inspirer.

praNAms to all students of Adi Shankaracharya.
