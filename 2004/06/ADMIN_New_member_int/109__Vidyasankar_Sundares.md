I hail from a small agraharam in Tanjore Dist in Tamil NAdu called Ganapathi 
Agraharam. We have migrated to Chennai and have been living here for a long 
time now. I studied Brihadaranyaka Upanishad under Br Sri Goda Venkateswara 
Sastrigal. Also completed some chapters of Sankara's Sutra Bhasyam under Br 
Sri PSA Vajapeyaji at Musiri. At present studying Dharma sastra under Br Sri 
Rajagopala Ganapadigal and Br Sri E.Balasubramania Sastrigal. Other 
interests include Mimamsa and Nyaya. A keen practitioner of Sri Vidya puja.
