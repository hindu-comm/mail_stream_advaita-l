Hello All,

Namaskara.

We all know that Guru Poornima is coming very near. In regards to the same I
have  a question.
I came to know thru an audio cassette of lecture on Guru Poornima  by
Bangalore's  Ramakrishna Ashram president, Swami Harshanandaji Maharaj, that
Grushastaas can also follow or perform the Chaturmaasa Vrata.
So can u please tell how can Gruhasta Ashrama People can follow this
Chaturmaasa Vrata.

Thanks in advance.

Jai Sri Ram,
