Today Chaturmasa started for Grhasthas.  (Ashadha Shukla 11 being a vrddha
tithi, it started today for Smartas.  It will start tomorrow for
Vaishnavas.)

I've made it a habit to observe the chaturmasa vrata by trying to study a
shastra in-depth over the 4 month period.  As the Bhagavata Purana is one
of my favorites I am going to read that this year.  Another reason is that
we recently found out we are going to have another child.  Before my
daughter Shailaja was born I also read from the Bhagavata Purana every day
to my wife and I attribute her being a beautiful, bright and Dharmic girl
to that.  So I would like to continue the tradition with this child also.

The reason I mention this here is that we can set up
another list and have a group discussion if there is interest.  Let me
know via private mail.
