Your translation is correct.

The subtle point is that even this "merging into one" is a manner of 
speaking only. Full realization in the advaita sense involves realizing that 
there were no two entities to begin with.

In true essence, there is only one entity. However, continuing to speak in 
terms of before and after realization, the instant you give room for two 
entities before realization, there is room for infinite entities. The third 
entity in the sentence tat tvam asi is the guru who reveals this truth to 
the disciple. The true guru who can reveal the truth is one who has already 
realized the truth as "So'ham", so even this apparent third entity, the 
speaker of "you are that", is in essence identical with the second entity, 
the he in "I am he".
