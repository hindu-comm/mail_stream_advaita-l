Pranaams, and thanks for the very interesting discussion by Shree Rama
and Venkat.

Inherent in the discussion of ignorance and its analogy with darkness is
the assumption about the nature of the knowledge; and the nature of
knowledge in the format of the advaita, particularly during the post
Shankra period.   Knowledge is considered as swataH sidhham and hence
Ramas reminder from bhashya- s that it is vastu tantra.  Here one is
faced with the distinction of knowledge of versus knowledge itself.
Knowledge of a pot or any object for that mater  that it can be vastu
tantram,  but pot can not be swatah siddham  - hence it is
puurvaabhaava patriyogini  counter to its previous non-existence. 
Removal of darkness or ignorance does not necessarily imply the vision
of pot unless the pot is preexisting, and then only it becomes vastu
tantram as Rama rightly pointed out.  The removal darkness and
simultaneity of the vision of pot in the light can occur for a
pre-existing objects  which of course is implied  but for deeper
analysis it has be recognized, otherwise objectors will jump on it.   
Hence the vision of the pot although vastu tantram is not independent of
pramana- This is inherent in any examples which involves
objectification. 

 The  pure knowledge( in contrast to knowledge of..) is swataH siddham
since it is chaitanya swaruupam; and that is aprameyam as no means of
knowledge is required to know itself.  

The confusion of the knowledge of where a pramaana has to operate
(even if it is vastu tantram) and self-knowledge which has aparameyam
has in my opinion led to the confusion of bhava ruupa aj~naana in
contrast to abhaavaruupa aj~naana.

Any thoughts on that?

Hari OM!
