The Bhashyakara writes in the Mandukya Upanishad Bhashya that the function of Vedic pramana in the field of Atma Jnana is only to destroy the ignorance.  He says that Veda only removes ignorance and Atman is already Self-established Consiousness which does not need any further pramana to entighten it.

Apart from destroying the darkness, light does not do anything else to enlighten  a pot.

however, in his Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Bhashyam (Asadeva Idamagra Aaseeth) while establishing that even effect existed before creation, he mentions that it cannot be said that light simply destroys the darkness, it also entlightens the pot, as the pot is also seen covered with light.

How should we understand this two opposite statements; one in Mandukya and the other in Brihadaranyaka.
