The Bhashyakara writes in the Mandukya Upanishad Bhashya that the function
of Vedic pramana in the field of Atma Jnana is only to destroy the
ignorance. He says that Veda only removes ignorance and Atman is already
Self-established Consiousness which does not need any further pramana to
entighten it. Apart from destroying the darkness, light does not do
anything else to enlighten a pot.
