If I remember, Sankhya is described upto 2-39 starting from ashochyaan 
anya sochatvam ....After that Krishna goes into the discussion of yoga -
raps it up in 2-53, when Arjuna asks about shtitapraj~na lakshna.

After listening to SthitaprajnalakshaNa Arjuna raises a doubt since both
sankhya and yoga were emphasized in the last chapter. Hence Krishna's
steatment that follows: lokesmin dvividhaa niShTaa ...

Hari OM!

What you have is destiny and what you do with what you have is self-effort. Future destiny is post destiny modified by your present action. You are not only the prisoner of your past but master of your future. - Swami Chinmayananda
