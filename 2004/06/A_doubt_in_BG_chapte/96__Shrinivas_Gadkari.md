Namaste,

In chapter 2, the glory of a sAmya buddhi attained
via the knowledge of tattvas (sAnkhya) is described.

Question is, before really attaining the high state
of buddhi via sAnkhya/ jnAna yoga, can we start acting
as we would after attining this knowledge?

No. Until this state is attained, karma yoga (which
is actually no different from sAdhanA) is prescribed.

Regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari
