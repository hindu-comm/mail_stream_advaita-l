Namaste, Shankar..

About this matter, I always think of the sea and the drop of sea water..are
they the same? Are they different? In Essence they are the same, but in a
given moment ( maya), they are not the same exactly, tho they are the same
in Essence..beyond our form world the paradox is the rule..maybe it is only
here, in our rational and linear conscience we see the "or" "or" situation.

This is my understanding about it and I would like also to know what the
others think about it..

Thanks, my pranams to all..

Asuman Martone
