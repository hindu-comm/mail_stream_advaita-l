I got curious about this and did some checking. I was able to trace
this to the maadhaviiya "sa.mkara digvijayam of "srii vidyaara.nya

Refer to 13.65-13.66, where "sa.mkara instructs sure"svara to write
vaartikas on his bhaa.syas instead of the suutra bhaa.syam

mama yaaju.sii yaa "saakhaa ... tadvaartika.m mama k.rta bhavataa pra.neya.m and

tadvat tvadiiyaa khalu kaa.nva "saakhaa mamaapi tatraasti tadantabhaa.syam |
tadvaartika.m caapi vidheya ...

13.65 is quite clear.
