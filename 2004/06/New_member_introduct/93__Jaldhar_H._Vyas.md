       My name is Mohan. I'm basically from Trichy, Tamil Nadu. I'm now
working in USA as Software Engineer. I'm very much interested in
Spirituality mostly the concept of Advaita its is so beautiful that i want
to know more about it. I'm exposed to this since the last year so i'm
relatively new. I'm a devotee of Sivaya Subramuniyaswami in Hawaii
(http://www.gurudeva.org). I also read the teaching of Ramana Maharishi
and want to know more about Sankara and his teachings.

Thanks

Mohan
