I give below my brief introduction:
*	Full Name : Krishnan Sankarasubramanian
*	Age: 44 years
*	Qualification: Chartered Accountant
*	Employed with : TVS Group companies @ Chennai, India
*	Caste: Vadamal, Iyer
*	Hailing from Tamil Nadu, India (Tirunelveli District)
*	Interested in reading. I have read many parts in the 6 volumes of
        Deivathin Kural Books. These are compilation of the speeches/lectures
        of His Holiness Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi Swamigal of the Kanchi
        Kamakoti Peetam and thereafter my interests grew manifold in the
        Advaita, Vedanta, Sankara sampradhayam and related topics.

I hope the above brief introduction will suffice. If you require any
further information, please let us know to do needful

Thanks
