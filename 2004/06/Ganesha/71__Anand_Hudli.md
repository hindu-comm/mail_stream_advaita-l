Could it be due to the fact that the R^ig vedic version of the Purushha 
sUkta does not have the "purushhaH" referred to above at the end of of a 
half-verse? Rather, it is in the middle of the first half-verse or 
hemistich.

I have not had the opportunity of listening to the Nambudiri style of 
chanting. Here in Bangalore, two R^id vedic chanting styles are prevalent - 
the Sringeri style and the GokarNa style. The Sringeri style sounds almost 
like the Krishna Yajurveda style. The GokarNa style, which I believe is also 
used in Tamil Nadu,  sounds more different from the Krishna Yajur Veda. 
Notably, the elongation of certain vowels is peculiar to this style. Our 
family uses the GokarNa style.
