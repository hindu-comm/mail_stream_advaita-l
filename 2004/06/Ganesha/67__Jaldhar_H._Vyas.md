Wasn't it the other way around?  Shankaracharya belonged to Taittiriya
shakha and Mandana Mishra (who became Sureshvaracharya according to
tradition) belonged to Kanva shakha.  This would make sense as
Shankaracharya came from Kerala in the south where Krishnayajurveda is
more prevalent, and Mandana Mishra came from Mithila which was Maharshi
Yajnavalkyas' homeland too.
