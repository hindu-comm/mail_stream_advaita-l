raised earlier.  I would however request any of the members to give
the names of at least some of the sakhas other than Krishna Yajurveda.

A few other name of some Shakha's are Maadhyandina Shakha and Kanva Shakha 
(Shukla Yajurveda) and Katha Shakha and Maitraayani Shakha (Krishna 
Yajurveda).
Let me tell you here that Bhagavan Adi Shankaracharya belonged to the Kanva 
Shakha of the Shukla Yajurveda and his main disciple Shri Sureshvaracharya 
(the first master of the Shringeri) belonged to the Taittiriya Shakha of the 
Krishna YajurVeda.
Did you know that the most famous Shakha before around 1000 years in India 
was Katha Shakha, which is relatively unknow today. Today the most famous 
Shakha of the Yajurveda is the Madhyandina Shakha of the Shukla Yajurveda.
Thank you,
Siddhartha Krishna
