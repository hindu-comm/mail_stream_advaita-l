Kerala is somewhat unique in the South. Most Kerala Namputhiris are
actually .rg vedins. In the other 3 states, most are K.r.s.na
yajurvedins. Have "sa.mkara and sure"svara mentioned which veda they
belonged to in their works or is it from tradition/the "sa.mkara
vijayams? If we are going by probability, "sa.mkara was probably a .rg
vedin.

Another unique thing about the namputhiris is the way they chant the
vedas. For example, the puru.sa suuktam would be chanted
(approximately by sound) sahasra"siir.saa puru.s*aha* (note the
ending) by other South Indians. The namputhiris employ an actual
visarga even at the end of the sentence, so it would be puru.sah, just
like in the middle for example adbhyasambhuutah p.rthivyai rasaacca. I
was somewhat suprised when I heard it being chanted this way.

BTW, there are "sukla yajurvedins in South India also. They are just
much fewer in number.
