Namaste.

This supplemental note is on the words
satya-mithyAtva-yogAt (by means of the concepts of Truth
and mithyA) in the first line of shloka 3.  It is said
that in Brahma Sutra Bhashya of Shankara the following
sentence occurs:

satyAnRte mithunI-kRtya aham-idaM mamedam-iti
naisargikoyaM loka-vyavahAraH

that is, the  mixing up of Truth and non-Truth (anRta)
gives rise to the common worldly parlance of  I am this,
and This is mine.  This reference to Shankara Bhashya
occurs in a commentary on Narayaneeyam-91-1. The context is
again a similar idea contained in the words 

baddha-mithyArtha-dRshhTeH

 in that shloka of Narayaneeyam, meaning because of the
deep-rooted wrong acceptance of ephemeral values as true
and enduring. The author of the commentary, Kadalangudy
Natesa Sastrigal, opines that these words of Narayaneeyam
could as well have been

satya-mithyArtha-dRshhTeH,

 and therefore would go back to the above stated sentence
from Brahma Sutra Bhashya.
It is interesting to note that Shankaracharya uses the same
words of his,  here in  Shata-shlokI.

The actual location of the above sentence of Shankara
Bhashya has however not been found by me. I would
appreciate readers help on this. 

Regarding Narayaneeyam Shloka 91-1, one can see my  posting
on  the shloka in

or in the files section of advaitin under Narayaniyam.

PraNAms to all students of Adi Shankaracharya.
