Friends,

While this is not necessarily related to Advaita, I would like to know of authentic resources (including internet resources) that describe, preferably with English translation, how one should conduct simple daily puja: the mantras to use and their sequence, and how one without a clear family tradition of daily puja can decide what method is best for oneself. 

Sridhar
