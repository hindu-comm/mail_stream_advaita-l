Namaste.

This is to announce a series of 50 posts on Shata-shlokI by
Adi Shankara from tomorrow.

The title means A Century of Verses. It actually 
consists of 101 four-line verses, all of the same metre
with 21 syllables in each quarter. The work is a capsuled
version  of the whole spectrum of the fundamentals of
advaita, straight from the Master. Because it is poetry, it
spares us  the difficult terrain of long-winding arguments
and dialectics in prose that is characteristic of  the
commentaries or Bhashyas.  So even  those of us who are
beginners to advaita, as well as those who are not
comfortable with Sanskrit, can appreciate it.  And further,
unlike the commentaries, it could probably have been
spoken out by the Acharya rather than composed in a
written manner. Consequently there is an added style 
which, in addition,  includes the usual majesty of
Shankaras writing -- of a  purposeful extempore 
after-dinner conversation, the poetic impact of which may
be enjoyed more if we know the language. I recommend it to
every reader, who has any interest in advaita. Indeed I
would like to call it: Triple A  FAQ on advaita 
standing for Authentic Answers from the Acharya to
Frequently Asked Questions on advaita. Some of the shlokas
would probably admit a lengthy discussion by the group.
Many shlokas would correct the wrong fear current among
newcomers to advaita that it might after all only  be a dry
philosophy far removed from humane and ethical
considerations. 

My source is the book Select works of Sri Sankaracharya 
with a general translation  by S. Venkataramanan, and with
a Foreword by K. Balasubramania Iyer, published by G.A.
Natesan and Co., Madras, in 1944.

PraNAms to all students of  Adi Shankaracharya
