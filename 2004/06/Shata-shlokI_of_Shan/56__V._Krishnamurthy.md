Note: This shloka is a beautiful synopsis of a famous long
passage from the Brihad-Aranyakopanishad  Ch.II, 4th
Brahmana, concluding with the words: 
na va are sarvasya kamaya sarvam priyam bhavati,
atmanas-tu kamaya sarvam priyam bhavati; atma va are
drastavyah srotavyo mantavyo nididhyasitavyo.  For an
authentic  exposition of the passage see:
http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/brdup/brhad_II-04.html ,
particulary the portion before and after the following
conclusive observation:

The love that you feel in respect of an object is in fact
the love that you feel towards that which is called
perfection and completeness. It is not really a love for
the object. You have thoroughly misunderstood the whole
point, even when you are clinging to a particular object as
if it is the source of satisfaction. The mind does not want
an object; it wants completeness of being. That is what it
is searching for. Thus, when there is a promise of the
fulfilment that it seeks, through the perception of an
object that appears to be its counterpart, there is a
sudden feeling that fullness is going to come, and there is
a satisfaction even on the perception of that object; and
there is an apparent satisfaction, just by the imagined
possession of it together with the yearning for actual
possession. So, what is it that you are asking for? You are
not asking for any object or thing; you are asking for a
condition of completeness in your being. So, my dear
friend, says Yajnavalkya, nobody is dear. No object can be
regarded as lovable or desirable. It is something else that
you love and are asking for, but by a notion that is
completely misconstrued, you believe that the object is
loved.
