//

idaM jagat akhilaM : All this world
nAma-rUpAtmakaM :  consisting of name and form (only) 
vairAja-vyashhTi-rUpaM syAt : is only the individualised
manifestation (vyashhTi) of the universal entity
(vairAja, meaning, of virAT).
antaHstha-prANa-mukhyAt : By virtue of the primal
life-force within,
pracalati : it moves
punaH vetti :  and knows
sarvAn padArthAn : all objects.
ithaM sAkshhAt vijAnan : Thus directly realising
iti : that 
savitRvat  : Like the Sun
na ayaM kartA : this Self is not the doer
na bhoktA : nor the experiencer, 
yaH jnAna-vijnAna-pUrNaH : he, who is full of theoretical
knowledge and experiential confirmation,
vyavaharati : carries on his life-journey
parAtma-anusandhAna-pUrvaM : through contemplative living
in the Supreme Self.

Note: So what is the bottom line for us? It is
parAtma-anusandhAnaM. The Acharyas stamp in each shloka
is what we have to take as his final teaching to us. Recall
that he defines Bhakti itself in Viveka-chudamani as
sva-svarUpa-anusandhAnaM, that is, Contemplative living
in ones natural state.

//

vairAgyaM : Non-attachment
dvividham-abhihitaM : is pronounced to be of two kinds,
(namely)
nairvedyaM : that which is inspired by disgust (nirveda)
jnAna-garbhaM : (and) that which originates from knowledge.
AdyaM : The former
bhavati : arises 
dukha-avalokAt : from the observation of the sorrowful
ending 
prAyaH : generally
gRha-suhRt-putra-vitta-IshhaNAdeH : of desires for home,
friends, sons or wealth.
anya-jnAna-upadeshAt  yat : The latter, by virtue of the
wisdom imparted,
heyatA syAt : is the rejection of 
udita-vishhaye : the above-mentioned things,
vAntavat : like vomitted matter.
niyamita-manasAM : For those of controlled mind,
pravrajyA api : renunciation also
dvidhA syAt : is of two kinds, (namely)
dehataH : from the body
gehatash-ca : and from the home.

Note: Renunciation from the home, has to be jnAna-garbhaM
(born out of wisdom), rather than, of just a disgust for
worldly life.  Only then it will lead to renunciation of
the body, mind  and intellect.
