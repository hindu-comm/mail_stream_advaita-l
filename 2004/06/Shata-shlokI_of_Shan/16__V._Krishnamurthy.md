 // 

na eva dRshhTaH : There is nothing known
dRshhTAntaH : (as ) comparable
tribhuvana-jaThare : in all the three worlds
sad-guroH : to the revered teacher
jnAna-dAtuH : who dispenses knowledge.
sparshaH tatra kalpyaH cet : If sparsha, the
philosophers stone be one such,
saH nayati : it turns
ashmasAraM : iron
svarNatAM :  into gold,
aho : (but) alas!
na sparshatvaM : not into being sparsha, the
philosophers stone.
tathA api : On the other hand,
sad-guruH : the revered teacher
vidhatte : creates, produces
sAmyaM : equality
svIyaM : (with) himself
svIya-shishhye : in his disciple
shrita-caraNa-yuge : who takes refuge in his feet.
tena : By this reason,
bhavati : he becomes 
nirupamaH : peerless
vA : or  more,
aloukikopi : even transcendental.

Important note: In organizing the translation into English,
the Sanskrit words of the verse have been re-sequenced in
such a way that their English meanings as given above, when
read in the same sequence, will make sense.  We shall
follow this practice, in all the succeeding shlokas. 
Note on shloka 1: That the Guru becomes transcendental is
the stamp of the Acharya in this shloka. Such punchlines in
almost every shloka are characteristic of his Vedanta
poetic works, particularly in this Shata-shlokI. As far as
I know -- I would like to be corrected here -- probably
this is the only place, of all his works, where Adi
Shankara mentions this unique quality of the Guru-Acharya 
namely the quality that the Guru produces disciples who
themselves become Gurus in due time, thus keeping the
Guru-paramparA ever alive, -- not just alive, but rising to
greater and greater heights.

tApam-unmIlayanti api : and afford relief from heat 
atanu-tanubhRtAM : to diverse embodied beings,

AcAryAt : from the teacher,
sakruNa-hRdayAH : with hearts full of compassion,

svoktibhiH : by their talks
sannidhaU vidhi-vashataH samsthitAnAM :all those

tredhA tApaM : (from) the three kinds of suffering 
(adhyAtma, adhidaivata, adhibhautika)
(tredhA) pApaM ca : and also (from) the three kinds of sin
(body, speech and mind).

Note 1. Compare from Narada bhakti sutra No.69:
tIrthI-kurvanti tIrthAni, su-karmI kurvanti karmANi,
sac-chAstrI-kurvanti shAstrANi
They make holy places holy, make works   well worked, and
make scriptures into real scriptures  by explaining their
purport well and meaningful for others.

praNAms to all students of Adi Shankaracharya
