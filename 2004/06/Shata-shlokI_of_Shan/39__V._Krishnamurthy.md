matvA strI-veshha-dhArI stry-aham-iti kurute kim naTo
bhartur-ichhAM
tadvac-charIra AtmA pRthag-anubhavato dehato yas-sa-sAkshhI
//

yaH : A person
svIkurvan : assuming
vyAghra-veshhaM : the mask of a tiger
sva-jaThara-bhRtaye : for his own livelihood
bhIshhayan ca : and frightening
mugdhAn : the innocent ones 
sa bAdhate kim nu : does he ever injure 
nara-pashu-mukhAn satvAn : any person, beast or living
thing
vyAghrohaM ithaM matyA : by the impression I am a tiger
?
(Or, )
naraH : the actor
strIveshha-dhArI : donning the role of a woman --
ichhAM kurute kim :  does he pant for 
bhartuH : a husband
strI ahaM iti matvA : thinking I am a woman?
tadvat : So also (is)
AtmA : the Self
shArIraH : living in the body
pRthak : but being different  
dehataH :  from the body
anubhavataH : (as well as) from experience;
saH sAkshhI : he is only the witness.

Note: The lesson therefore is the same as the punchline
teaching of the Gita:  Act, act, in the living present,
with a total detachment to everything that comes and goes
(AgamApAyI). Everything associated with this body, mind and
intellect, comes and goes!

svaM bAlaM rodamAnaM cira-tara-samayaM shAntim-Anetum-agre 
drAkshhaM khArjUram-AmraM sukadalam-athavA
yojayaty-ambikAsya /
tadvac-cetoti-mUDhaM bahu-janana-bhavAn
mouDhya-samskAra-yogAt 
bodho-pAyair-anekaiH avasham-upanishhad-bodhayAmAsa samyak
//

ambikA : A mother
shAntiM AnetuM : in order to pacify
svaM bAlaM : her child
rodamAnaM : who has been crying
cira-tara-samayaM : for a very long time
yojayati : offers (or) places
asya agre : before the child
drAkshhaM : grape,
khArjUraM : date,
AmraM : mango,
sukadalaM : good banana,
athavA : and the like.
tadvat : So also
Upanishhat : The Upanishad
Samyak bodhayAmAsa : has well taught (i.e., enlightened)
anekaiH bodhopAyaiH : by various teaching strategies
ati-mUDhaM cetaH : the utterly foolish mind
avashaM : which is not in control of itself
mouDhya-samskAra-yogAt : because of the acquired dilution
of faculties
bahu-janana-bhAvAt : consequent to the numerous lives (that
it has gone through).

Note: So when the scriptures show you a carrot at the end
of the stick, even if it be a heavenly carrot,  that is
only a bodhopAya, a teaching strategy. 

Note 2: Compare shloka XI  3  44 from Shrimad Bhagavatam:

Parokshha-vAdo vedoyaM bAlAnAm anushAsanaM /
Karma-mokshhAya karmANi vidhatte hy-agadaM yathA //

meaning, The Vedas always tell you only indirectly, they
hide their real intent. It is like getting things done by
children. The Vedas prescribe actions/rituals for you so
that in due time you may  be relieved of all actions.

PraNAms to all students of Adi Shankaracharya
