na asat AsIt : Non-entity was not there
tucchatvAt  : that being absolutely non-existent
gagana-kusumavat : like the sky-flower
no sat AsIt : Nor was there an entity
bhedakaM : that could admit of division
kintu : But
AbhyAM anyat AsIt : there was something different from
these two.
tadAnIM : Then
na Asa lokaH : the universe was not there
vyavahRti-gati-sat : as it now exists in its phenomenal
condition.
Kintu : However,
arvAg-eva : already
(Asa) : it existed 
aparaH : differently
shuktau rajatavat : like silver (already existing) in the
mother-of-pearl.
no : Nor was (then)
virAT : the primordial Cosmic substance
vyoma-pUrvaH : sprung from Space.
atha etat kiM bhavet :  For what is there,
kahaka-salilavat : like the water produced by a magician
sharmaNi Atmani : that can cover the Self?
AvarIvaH: ???

Note 1: It is for us now to recall the Nasadiya-sukta of
Rg Veda (X  129)!

Note 2 : It might be worthwhile to find, in the light of
the wonderful presentation of Ken-ji on MayA in the Rg
Veda, whether the word kahaka occurs in the Rg Veda and,
with what sense.

Note 3. I would need help on the word AvarIvaH.
