AdyA dehA-nubhandhAd-bhavati tad-aparA sA ca sarvAtmakatvAt
Adau brahm-Aham-asmIty-anubhava udite khal-vidam brahma
pashcAt //

prathamaM : At the outset
abhihitA : is enunciated
Atma-anAtma-pratItiH : the perception of the Self and the
non-Self
Satya-mithyAtva-yogAt : (respectively) by means of Truth
and of MithyA.
Brahma-pratItiH : Realisation  of brahman
nigama-nigaditA : is spoken of by the Vedas
dvedhA : as two-fold
svAnubhUtyA : by means of our experience, (and)
upapattyA : by means of conclusive proof.
AdyA : The former
bhavati : arises
dehAnubhandhAt : by consideration of the body as only an
appendage,
tat aparA sA : while the latter
(bhavati) : (arises)
sarvAtmakatvAt : by consideration of universal immanence.
Adau : In the beginning (the Realisation is)
Brahma-aham-asmi iti : that I am brahman
anubhave udite : when the experience rises  
pashcAt : thereafter, (it is)
idam khalu brahma : All this is indeed brahman.

Note  how the Acharya goes to the heart of the problem
right in the beginning. He has 99 shlokas to go; but he
wastes no time!

AtmA cid-vit-sukhAtmAnubhava-paricitaH sarva-dehAdiyantA 
satyevaM mUDha-buddhir-bhajati nanu
janonitya-dehAtma-buddhiM /
bAhyosthi-snAyu-majjA-pala-rudhira-vasA-carma-medo-yug-antaH
viNmUtra-shleshhma-pUrNaM sva-para-vapur-aho samviditvApi
bhUyaH //

AtmA : The Self
Cit-vid-sukha-AtmA : is of the nature of Consciousness,
Knowledge, Bliss.
anubhava-paricitaH : (It) can be known by direct
experience.
Sarva-dehAdi-yantA : (It) is the inspirer in all bodies,
senses etc.
Evam sati : And yet
mUDha-buddhiH janaH : the foolish person
bhajati : treasures
anitya-deha-Atma-buddhiM : the understanding that this
transient body is the Self.
nanu aho : alas! It is so
api samviditvA bhUyaH : although (he) knows again and again
 that
Sva-para-vapuH : the body either of his or of others
bAhyaH : (is) externally 
asthi-snAyu-majjA-pala-rudhira-vasA-carma-medo-yug :
composed of  bones, tendon, marrow, flesh, blood, nerve,
skin and fat
antaH : (and) internally 
viN-mUtra-shleshhma-pUrNaM :  full of excrement, urine and
phlegm.

Note 1: samviditvApi bhUyaH  is the Acharyas emphasis
in the shloka.

Note 2. Compare with the more succinct version in his own
Aparokshanubhuti shloka No.23: 

dehoham ityayaM mUDhaH kRtvA tishhTaty-aho janaH /
mamAyam-ityapi jnAtvA ghaTa-drAshhTeva sarvadA //

Meaning: How strange is it that a person ignorantly rests
contented with the idea that he is the body, while he knows
it as something belonging to him (and therefore apart from
him) even as a person who sees a pot (knows it as apart
from him) !
