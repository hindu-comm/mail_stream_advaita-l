prANAgni-hotraM :the consecration of food to Fire of Life

vidhivat : according to prescriptions,
martyaH : remains mortal.

Note: kevalAgho bhavati kevalAdI  are exact words from
the yajur-veda; probably it occurs in the other vedas also.
It is a delight to see how the Acharya dexterously, but
effortlessly,  handles passages from their original vedic
source.

PraNAms to all students of Adi Shankaracharya.
