Note: Recall that when Lord Krishna summarises, at the end
of the 18th chapter, the whole of his teaching, his
description (in two shlokas : 52, 53)  of the behaviour of
the Seeker of the Ultimate, includes  laghvAshI 
meaning, the one who eats less, that is, only that much to
support the life  as one of the essential qualifications.
