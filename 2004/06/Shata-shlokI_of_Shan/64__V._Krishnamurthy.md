loke : In the world
dvividhaM abhihitaM : there are two kinds (of goals),
namely, 
shreyaH : what is preferable
preyaH ca : and what is pleasant.
AtyantikaM ca : That which is absolute
kAmyaM : and that which is activated by desire.

kshhaNa-lava-virasaM : and becomes insipid in an instant.
mandAH : The ignorant
tat cikIrshhanti : go after it.

tanubhRtAM : Among all human beings
mumukshhuH : the real seeker of liberation
sa khalu yaH : is indeed he, who
antar-nishhTaH : being inwardly firm, 
AyuH nayati :  spends his whole life
evam bhAvayan : with the following attitude, (namely)
ahaM tarangaH asmi iti : that I am (only) a wave
AtmAmbodheH : of the Ocean of the Self
gamane : while going about,
ahaM  maNiH iti : that I am (only) a bead
samvit-sUtrAnuviddhaH : strung on the thread of Universal
Consciousness
AsanasthaH : while seated,
AtmAvalokAt dRshhTaH asmi iti : that I am perceiving
myself through this perception of the Self
indriyArtha-pratItau : while sense-objects are perceived, 
(and)
Ananda-sindhau magnaH : that I am deep into the Ocean of
Bliss
shayana-vidhau : while sleeping.

Note 1: This shloka is a beautifully capsuled answer to
those who like to  question: How does an advaitin live?
What is to be practised for being an advaitin?.

Note 2: This is the time for members to seek parallel
statements in advaitic literature. That would strengthen
our conviction in what is said.  That would also help the
nidhidhyAsana of advaitic logic and its conclusions. 

PraNAms to all students of Adi Shankaracharya.
