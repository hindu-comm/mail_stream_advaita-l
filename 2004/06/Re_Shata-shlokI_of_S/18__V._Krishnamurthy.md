Namaste, Jaldhar Vyas-ji,

Yes, the word by word translation is mine -- though I make
some alterations in the general translation (as a whole)
given by Shri Venkatramanan in his book 'Selected works of
Shankaracharya'. As the text advances, there are several
places where I do differ from him.

PraNAms to all students of Adi Shankaracharya
