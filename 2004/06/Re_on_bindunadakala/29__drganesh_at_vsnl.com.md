This particular stotram is commonly chanted as prayer and meditation among many chinmaya and dayananda spiritual classes before discourses etc as part of gurustotram and guru-stotram as such is popular for teaching to children.
Swami paramarthananda's prayer book has this transalation for this sloka--
"My guru is of the nature of eternal,ever-tranquil,pure consciousness. This consciousness transcends space and is beyond bindu,nada,kala [the causal,subtle, and gross forms of the universe].My prostration to that guru."
I hope this is useful.
