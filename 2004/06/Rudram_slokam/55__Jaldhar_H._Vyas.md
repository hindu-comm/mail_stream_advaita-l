Again, let me suggest the list archives which can be accessed from
http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/advaita-l  I'm sure such
a link has been suggested before.

But I must ask why you want to listen to a download?  If you are not
entitled to learn it you will not benefit.  If you are entitled then you
should learn it the proper way so you can continue the tradition on to
your descendents.
