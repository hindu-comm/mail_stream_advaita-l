Sri. Jaldharji - I know of a book "The Vedas" published by Bhartiya Vidya 
Bhavan. This book was based on the lectures of Sri Chandrasekharendra 
Saraswati Swami of Kanchi peetam. Is there another book on the subject by 
Sri. Chandrasekhara Bharati Swami also?  Can you give more details like who 
the publisher is etc.?

Thanks,
Ravi
