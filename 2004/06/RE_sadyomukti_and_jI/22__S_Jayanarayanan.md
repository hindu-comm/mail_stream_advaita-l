As far as I am aware, there is no reason for "strengthening of
knowledge" for a jIvanmukta, as the jIvanmukta is precisely one whose
knowledge is already strengthened.

Again, as far as I know, the difference in the terms stems not from the
state - both are "muktas" - but from the PATH that was taken to attain
that state. As mentioned above, the sadyomukta is one who attains firm
knowledge instantly, but a jIvanmukta is one who initially attained
infirm knowledge, and then finally attained firm knowledge. It is like
the analogy of two persons taking different routes to land up in the
same location - the PATHS are different, but the final location is the
same.

Videhamukta is simply a jIvanmukta (or perhaps even a sadyomukta) who
has given up his embodied state *as perceived by others* (for a mukta
always knows that he has no relationship to the physical body).
