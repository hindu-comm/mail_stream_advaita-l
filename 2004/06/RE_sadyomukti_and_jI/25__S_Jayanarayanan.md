GYAna has risen, but that doesn't mean that the GYAnI is a jIvanmukta!

Again, this strengthening of GYAna is NOT for a jIvanmukta. A
jIvanmukta is synonymous with a sthitapraGYa - one whose GYAna is
ALREADY strengthened.

I don't see Shankara advocating any effort for a jIvanmukta, he only
does so for a GYAnI. All jIvanmuktas are GYAnIs, but not all GYAnIs are
jIvanmuktas!

As for the residual avidyA in the jIvanmukta, it has been explained
well in the jIvanmuktiviveka (JMV) of svAmi vidyAraNya.

In other words, the sequence for attainment of jIvanmukti is:

Infirm GYAna -> Effort to strengthen GYAna -> jIvanmukti

Also discussed in the JMV.
