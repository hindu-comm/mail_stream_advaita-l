Yes, if one uses the word jIvanmukti strictly, but no if the meaning is 
extended (as has been done during the course of this discussion) to also 
refer to different kinds of worshippers of saguNa brahman, particularly 
those who do not return to birth, but still have a further step of attaining 
brahmaloka before achieving full jnAna. I would like to apply the term 
jIvanmukti strictly myself, but recognize the difficulty in applying it thus 
when diverse texts are quoted (again, as has been done in this discussion).

No, this is not correct, for sadyomukti (as I described it in the preceding 
posts) is not derived from recent times, but is mentioned in SankarAcArya's 
commentaries, written more than a thousand years prior to Sri Ramana 
Maharishi, based on upanishad texts that are timeless. It is therefore a 
question neither of belief nor of speculation.

All of this is quite besides the point. Everyone has had a never-ending 
succession of prior lives, and has died and been reborn countless times 
before the rise of Self-knowledge. We are all going through a process 
characterized by imperfect knowledge and ignorance through all these lives. 
We are only peripherally concerned with all the past lives, but we are 
deeply concerned with the blossoming of full knowledge in this life itself. 
The trajectory of anAdy-avidyA is unimportant. What is important is to 
recognize that avidyA is anAdi and finding the way out.

Finally signing off on this thread, with regards,
Vidyasankar
