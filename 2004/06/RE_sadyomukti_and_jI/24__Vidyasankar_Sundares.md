That is what I thought too, till I read the bRhadAraNyaka bhAshya 1.4.7, 
where SankarAcArya himself allows for the need to strengthen samyag-darSana 
and counter prArabdha karman, after the rise of jnAna. After reading it, I 
have come to the conclusion that right from the time of the bhAshyakAra, and 
most probably from even before, an allowance has been made for both one who 
needs no strengthening of jnAna and one who does need further sAdhana-s. 
This also explains why some later authors in the tradition debate whether 
there is or not any residual avidyA in the jIvanmukta. We may also compare 
these two types with the vidvat sannyAsin and the vividishA sannyAsin.

I do not see a necessary contradiction between 2 and 3, for they do not 
apply to the same person at the same time. It is a question of 
adhikAra-bheda.

That possibility cannot and should not be discounted. In fact, a large 
portion of SankarAcArya's sUtrabhAshya and upanishad bhAshyas are devoted to 
defending the thesis that the rise of knowledge can be instantaneous. It all 
depends on whether you view mukti as the achievement of a new reality or as 
the revelation of pre-existing reality. In advaita, it is seen as the 
latter.

Vidyasankar
