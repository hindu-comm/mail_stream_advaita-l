SVS

These are technical words in shaivam and part of their 36 tattvaa-s.  In
simple words, nAda-bindu-kala  denotes emanation of the manifested Universe.
Hence, here the praise makes the guru as one who is beyond  this external
manifestation.

If I am not mistaken nAda precedes bindu. Even in nAda, there is parAnAda a
soundless sound, from which praNava comes out. Also, there are things like
paraabindu.  If you refer to books on shaivam, you might find more and
accurate information on these terms. Google might also help.

Corrections are welcome.

Ravi
