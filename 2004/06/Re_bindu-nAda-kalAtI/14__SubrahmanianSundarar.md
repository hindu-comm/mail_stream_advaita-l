Sri Ravisankar:

Thank you for your explanation.  I will try what you suggested.



Sri Ravishankar Venkataraman:

This comes in the simple stotram on Guru that we teach children.  

chaitanya(H) shAshvata(H) shAntO vyOmAtItO niranjanaH |
bindu-nAda-kalAtItaH tasmai shri gurave namaH ||

I was reciting this to my daughter.  As I was reciting, it occured to me that I should understand the meaning.  These days children ask a lot of questions.  If I can't give good explanations and if they find that I am mechanically repeating, I am afraid that they may not take to it.  So, now I am trying to understand everything I (plan to) teach my children! - that's in brief the genesis of the question.

Regards,
SVS
