When our Rshis "saw" the mantras (they did not create them) it was over a
span of several generations and in a wide geographical area.  This
accounts for certain dialectical differences in the transmission of mantras by
various shakhas.  shiksha is the vedanga dealing with phonetic and the
shikshas and pratisakhyas of each shakha give the rules for svaras.  In
Vyakarana, the Ashtadhyayi of Panini notes the various ways Vedic
language differs from classical Sanskrit including in the matter of
svaras.  Bhattoji Dikshita gathered together all the Paninian sutras
related to Vedic in a special section of his Siddhanta Kaumudi.
