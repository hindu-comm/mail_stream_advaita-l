Namaskaram,

1 Can any body tell me how the Knowledge is described by Ramanuja in
Visishtadvaitha, as in Advaitha we say that is the absolute.

2 Visistadvaitha is closer to Dvaitha or Advaitha.


Thanks
Subramanian sahasranamam

You say that jIvanmukti is not salvation in the absolute sense and then
contradict yourself saying that salvation is for the soul and not the body.
How is this reconcilable? If salvation is connected only with the soul, how
does it matter whether the body is present or not?  Salvation is the
realisation of unity of the Self and Brahman. When this realisation has
dawned, there is nothing else to achieve. The presence or absence of a body
is immaterial. The soul of jIvanmukta doesnt merge with anything upon the
death of the physical body. The *merging*, *becoming* etc. are all just
figurative speech.

Hari Om
