Anandavalli of Taitriya starts with brahmavid aapnothi param,it then gives a definition 'lakshyartha' for brahman- which sankara has elaborately and beautifully commented upon.The upanisad then goes into elaboration of creation and the koshas ONLY to show that all these anatmas are different from atma and later the same upanisad says that all the anatmas get resolved in atma alone and that they dont have an independent existance.Hence, the purpose of differentiation is only to point towards the 'sat vasthu' and having done that dismisses all the kosas and creation.All the differences are from 'Avidya' standpoint and once the 'tatparyam of the sruthi' is arrived at,then there is only one advithiyam brahman,A=B but B is not A, being a product of maya.
