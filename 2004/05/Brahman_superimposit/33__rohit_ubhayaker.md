Dear  Saadhakas,

Superimposition  does  not  correspond  to  something  such  as  a  bedsheet  covering  a  cot , as  that  would  limit  Brahman  to  a  size.

It  is  easier  to  say  that  Brahman  imagines  Himself  as  the  world , etc. It  is  similar  to  how  a  child  at  play  imagines  himself  as  a  prince.
A  lot  of  thought  is  required . The  only  pitfall  is that  one  must  not  delve  into  the  nature  of  Maayaa ( as  anti-Advaitins)  do. Then  this  very  Maayaa  starts  deluding  you!

With  Love , 
Rohit  N. Ubhayaker.

Dear Members:

Perhaps my question is too much basic for this forum,
but I am reading a very interesting explanation of
Advaita Vedanta from the Web Site of Katha, written by
D. Krishna Ayyar.
In the Appendix 2, he said that ...there is no world
or mind of the same order of reality as Brahman, the
paramnartika satyam; both the world and the mind are
superimpositions on Brahman and are categorised as
vyavaharika satyam.
My question is: If Brahman is Atman in human beins, in
which form Brahman is superimposed on, for example, a
pot? Is D. Krishna Ayyar talking about a phisical,
material superimposition? Can we said that Brahman
live in material things?

Thank you very much for your patience with me...
With love...

María
