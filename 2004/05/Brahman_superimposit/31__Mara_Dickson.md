Dear Members:

Perhaps my question is too much basic for this forum,
but I am reading a very interesting explanation of
Advaita Vedanta from the Web Site of Katha, written by
D. Krishna Ayyar.
In the Appendix 2, he said that ...there is no world
or mind of the same order of reality as Brahman, the
paramnartika satyam; both the world and the mind are
superimpositions on Brahman and are categorised as
vyavaharika satyam.
My question is: If Brahman is Atman in human beins, in
which form Brahman is superimposed on, for example, a
pot? Is D. Krishna Ayyar talking about a phisical,
material superimposition? Can we said that Brahman
live in material things?

Thank you very much for your patience with me...
With love...

María
