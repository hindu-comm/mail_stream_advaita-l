Brahman is not just the Atman in humans. It is the *only thing* present in
all, homogenous like a lump of salt. It doesn't have any form and it is
neither inside or outside anything. In the case of objects such as pot etc.,
what we perceive is the illusionary name and form (nAma-rUpa) which is mAyA,
born out of ignornace. So the superimposition at the *object level* is that
between Brahman and the nAma-rUpa which is mAyA. There is no physical
material superimposition.
