Actually there is one more.  The Udasins are the followers of Shrichand
the son of  Guru Nanak the founder of the Sikh religion.  While they
revere Guru Granth Sahib as their holy book they also consider
Shankaracharya their acharya and follow the tenets of Advaita Vedanta.
Formerly this sect was as numerous as the keshdharis (the turbanned people
we usually associate with the name Sikh) and had control of most of the
prominent Gurudwaras.  But two things happened.  During the 19th century,
the khalsa movement amongst the Sikhs moved to sharply define their
religion away from its Hindu roots and in some court battles the Udasins
lost their control of Sikh shrines.  Then in 1947 during the tragedy of
partition they lost a lot of their remaining property in Sindh and
Pakistani Punjab.  But they still survive and have produced some prominent
scholar saints.  For instance the book Vichara Sagara which was lauded by
such luminaries as Swami Chandrashekharendra Saraswati and Shri Ramana was
written by an Udasin named Swami Nischaladas.

Rohit you are in Mumbai right?  Do you know of the existence of a
Sadhubela Math?  My readings indicate it was one of the leading Udasin
Maths and was transplanted there from Sindh after Indias independence.
