Quite possibly.  I based my post on some things I read.  Here are some
other interesting links I found:

http://www.sikh-heritage.co.uk/movements/Udasis/udasis.htm
http://www.sikh-heritage.co.uk/movements/Nirmalas/Nirmala Sikhs.htm

The whole site is an interesting read to learn about the complexity of
Sikh beliefs.
