Recently, I got a copy of the Pancha Rudra Ghana pATha book which contains 
five rudra sUktas of the R^ig Veda plus a couple of other R^iks such as 
"tryaMbakaM yajAmahe ..." and "ayaM me hasto...".  These Pancha Rudra sUktas 
are used in the "Rudra-abhiSheka" by the R^ig Vedins.

So far, I have not found any mistakes in the book as per the recitation of 
Shri Govinda Prakash Bhat, who is considered to be one of the foremost Vedic 
pundits as far as chanting is considered.

Anand
