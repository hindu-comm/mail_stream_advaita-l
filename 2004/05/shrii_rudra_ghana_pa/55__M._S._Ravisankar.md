www.ghanapati.com  publishes this book. You will find all the details about
the book on the website. It a very nicely typeset book and useful even if
you just do the standard  (samhita  paaTha) recitation.  Text is in
devanagari with clear swara markings and notes are in both Tamil and
English. This website also explains the patterns of different types of
recitation.

If you want listen to a ghana paTha sample online, you will find one in
www.musicindiaonline.com and one at
http://sanskrit.bhaarat.com/Dale/Audio.html

FYI.

Ravi
