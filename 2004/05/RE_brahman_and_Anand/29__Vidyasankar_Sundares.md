To clarify a couple of points,

1. As far as I can see, Sankara does not give room to think that Anandamaya 
koSa is a part of the antaHkaraNa (literally, internal organ, the cognitive 
apparatus through which we know). Clearly, manomaya and vijnAnamaya are 
aspects of the antaHkaraNa. That said, any experience of happiness is always 
via the antaHkaraNa.

2. We have to remember that Anandamaya is also equated with ISvara. Inasmuch 
as ISvara is conceived of as having guNa-s, which are posited by 
avidyA/mAyA, we can say that Anandamaya is also within the realm of avidyA. 
Anandamaya is not just the bhoktRtva-Sakti of jIva. However, kartRtva and 
bhoktRtva of the jIva are both derived from ISvara. As Sankara puts it 
elsewhere in the sUtrabhAshya, "karoty eva jIvaH ... ISvaraH kArayati". 
Thus, there is more to the Anandamaya-Atman in the advaita interpretation.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
