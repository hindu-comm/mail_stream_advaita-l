The two descriptions commonly used for brahman are -'satyam gnanam anantham' and  'sat chit ananda'. Anandamaya is also brahman because everything that is here is nothing but brahman , the 'mayat' suffix indicates gradation or vikara hence can be taken as an experiential ananda.
The common trap that many people fall is when we transalate ananda as 'bliss' because everyone will then want to experience that ultimate bliss.This brings some kind of mystisism to brahman which is misleading. The word 'anantha' is purposefully replaced by 'ananda' in the scriptures because it is difficult to conceptualise limitless or anantha in a student's mind.It is limitlessness when expressed in our minds is termed 'ananda'.Hence when we say brahman is ananda-it is really anantha.This ananda is nonexperiential and is the substratum of all the grades of experiential ananda possible in lokas.Hence one should never look out for ananda as a brahman experience.Any experience happens in time,hence false.
