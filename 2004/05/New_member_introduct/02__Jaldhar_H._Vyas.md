Greetings,
  My name is Christopher Kromer and I am a student interested in learning
  more about the Advaita Vedanta tradition. After some preliminary
  readings, I have found that the tradition subtly and precisely expresses
  the nature of life and of Reality. I am interested in learning more
  about the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta and in learning how its inherent
  system of thought is translated into a way of living. Sincerely,

  Christopher Kromer
