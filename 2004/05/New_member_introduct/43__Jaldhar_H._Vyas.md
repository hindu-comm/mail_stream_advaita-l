It is true that Iam at the bottm step of spirituality. But I have started
journey. As I have gone through some of the sthothras written by Shakara I
Understand can appriciate the scholarly and philosphical teachings. But
equally I afraid about my level of understanding. After tasting his
concepts, I have given small break from his philosophy as they are hard to
understand. But I continued my journey through understading other religions.
And trying to visualise from Hindu point of view.  I thought of once again
start looking into thoughts of guru's of Bhakti movement.

I still feel for my brain, it is difficult to digest and interprete the
views of advaitha vedanta. While I am searching for my "sandeha", I come
across your posting.
