Hi,
My interest is direct experience and to that end I am seeking information
about Advaitic thought.  I have read Yoga Vasishtha many times and various
other books like Advaita Bodha Deepika, Kaivalya Navaneeta and Tripura
Rahasya, the Bahagavad Gita (various versions), the Ramayana and lots of
other non-advaitic books.  Also for many years I have been studying Ramana
Maharshi and Nisargadatta Maharaj.   The Lamp of Non-Dual knowledge had a
profound effect on me and I feel I should explore Advaita-Vedanta further.
After reading Advaita Bodha Deepika it seemed unnecessary to read more books
but I soon realised, as Ramana Mararshi observed...when Self investigation
stops world investigation starts.   My flame still flickers and my ceiling
is still covered with soot.

I would deeply appreciate the names of other books like these or useful
suggestions any informed person may be kind enough to make.  Hope this
serves as an introduction.

Regards Mike Hastie.
