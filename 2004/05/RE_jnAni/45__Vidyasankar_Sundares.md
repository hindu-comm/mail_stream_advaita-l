As far as I am aware, Br. Up 1.4.7 is the key location where Sankara refers 
to the need for additional sAdhana-s after the rise of jnAna 
(samyag-jnAna-prAptAv apy avaSyaM bhAvinI pravRttiH ... ). Here, jnAna is 
something that has been obtained and therefore liable to be weaker than the 
previous impelling towards karma (tena pakshe prApta-jnAna-pravRtti 
daurbalyaM). So, yes, the term jnAnI is used apropos one who still feels 
subject to imperfection. The entire discussion here is whether any 
injunctions are applicable to the knower and Sankara concludes that yes, a 
niyama vidhi applies in these cases, in order to perfect the jnAna and to 
counter the effects of prArabdha karman.
