Sri Bhaskar, and other respectable members,
Please also accept my Namaskars. Sir! I humbly request you not to address me 
as prabhuji. I will be more than happy if you can address me with name. 
Please see my answers below:

Badisa: A jeevan mukta is technically said to have achieved salvation while 
living with a physical body, as he experienced his true nature. This is not 
called salvation in absolute sense. But it also does not mean that salvation 
is achieved little by little. In order to differenciate the state of divine 
experience of a jeevan mukta with vast majority of people who are not divine 
experienced, sruti technically calls the divine experienced persons as 
jeevan muktas, as these people have liberated from the bondages of the world 
(please see Muktiko Upanishad, 2.1, where Lord Ram teaches sri Hanuman that 
liberation from all bondages of world as jeevan mukti, and who so ever 
attained this stage is called jeevan mukta). Absolute salvation is concerned 
only with soul but not with physical body. Hence, in the case of a jeevan 
mukta, his soul merges in divine immediately after the death of his physical 
body. This is called absolute salvation. Many sruti texts support merging of 
soul in divine for absolute salvation (Prasna, Mundaka etc).

Namaskar
Badisa
