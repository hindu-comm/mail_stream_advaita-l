praNAm,

Thanks for this. I think I jumped to conclude too soon that 
MS has rendered what Adi ShankarA wrote. Sorry about that.
I'd read about manjarikaa's. Thanks for the information on 
the paNJarikaa's.

jai bajranga bali,
--praveeN

Hari Om,

I'm sorry if I'm totally off the mark, but here's what
I know: what MS has sung are the (12?) verses written by
Adi ShankarAchArya Himself. 

PranAm Praveen. If you notice MS sings stanzas 
1,2,5,11,18,20,21,23,27,29,31 (11 stanzas in all) of the entire 31 
stanzas(some say there are 2 extra stanzas to make it 33) in her 
rendition of Bhaja Govindam. Sri Sankara originally composed stanzas 1 
to 12 himself (called the dvAdas manjArika stotram) while stanzas 13 - 
26 were composed by his 14 disciples (called the chaturdasa manjArikaa 
stotram). MS chooses shlokAs composed by Sri SankarA as well as his 
disciples in her rendition.

I recently read that Bhaja Govindam is divided into two sets of verses. 
The set of 11 verses MS sings are called the dvaadashapaJNjarikaa while 
the rest are called the
charpaTapaJNjarikaa.  If anyone knows more about these verses and why 
they are called so - kindly enlighten.

Hair Om,
Navin
