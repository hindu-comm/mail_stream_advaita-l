Hari Om,

This is a small query regarding Smt. MS Subbalakshmi's rendition of 
Bhaja Govindam. Usually this is a cd/tape that comes with the 
Vishnusahasranama stotram and Bhaja Govindam.

Smt. Subbalakshmi in her rendition of Bhaja Govindam selects only a few 
verses from the entire poem. I would like to know if there is any 
special significance to these verses selected(I think they are verses 
1,2,5,11,18,20 and the last two verses - I might have missed out some 
more). Otherwise, is it because the poem is big that she chooses to 
render only these selected verses.

I shall also be glad to know if a complete rendition of Sri Sankara's 
composition has been sung by MS .

Hari Om,
Navin
