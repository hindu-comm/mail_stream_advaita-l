pranAm,

I'm sorry if I'm totally off the mark, but here's what
I know: what MS has sung are the (12?) verses written by
Adi ShankarAchArya Himself. The other (14?) verses that 
we've read were written by His disciples. Although the 
entire collection of stanzas is Bhaja govindam, MS has 
sung just what Adi ShankarA wrote.

jai bajranga bali,
--praveeN

I have always wondered why she only renedered select verses from the
bhaja govindam. I hope someone throws light on this question..

I looked around quite a bit for a complete rendition by MS but was
unable to find one. I doubt it she ever rendered the complete text.
