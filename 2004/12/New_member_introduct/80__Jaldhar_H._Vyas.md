Namaste.

Thanks for your response. I am member and Moderator of a Hindu newsgroup,
Caribbeanhindus, that serves Hindus who originated in the Caribbean.
Members of this group are located in Trinidad, Guyana, other Caribbean
islands, USA, UK, Canada, and other countries. I want to use your resource
to educate our people, including myself, on advaita-vedAnta. I hope your
list can provide this.

Dhanyavaad,

Deosaran
