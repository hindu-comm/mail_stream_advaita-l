Dear List Members,

The tatittiriiya braamhaNa has 3 aShTakams. The first anuvaaka of
the third aShTtakam is called nakhShatreShTi. It starts off with
agnirnaH paatu kR^ittikaaH. Part of it + some mantras from the
sa.nhitaa portion are known as the nakhShatra suuktam and can be found
in the mantra puShpam published by R.K Mutt. It also occurs in the
famous compilation by bodhaayana maharShi, the udakaSaanti.

A homam was performed based on the nakhShatreShTi. Please see:

Can knowledgeable list members give more details on this homam,
which suutra discusses this homam and so on. Also any reference to
published material would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Rama
