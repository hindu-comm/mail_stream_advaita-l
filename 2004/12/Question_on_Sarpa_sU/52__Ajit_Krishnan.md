Namaste,

I do not know too much about this, but here goes...

There is a strong tradition linking Skanda & Sarpa. This includes the
worship of the image of Sarpa as Skanda, and the worship of Sarpa along with
Skanda.

The story of Garuda & Vasuki is said to be in the Skanda purana. The divine
eagle, was starving, and attacked Vasuki while looking for prey. The sage
Kashyapa intervened, and requested Garuda to desist. He told Garuda of a
place where he would be able to satisfy his hunger. He told Vasuki, the
great Shiva bhakta, of a mountain where he would not be bothered again. He
was told that Kartikeya would come there at a later time, and always remain
by his side. 

I was also told of fragments of another legend where the lord took the form
of a snake to kill some asura in a mountain-cave. He was joined there by two
other divine snakes (probably vasuki and takshaka), and his samadhi took
place here. (This is said to be another meaning of the epitheth "guha"). 

It is also interesting to note that Skanda is commonly worshipped to rid
oneself of ailments relating to snakes.

In the panchayatana puja, the lord is invoked by some as follows:
"asmin naaga-bimbe naaga-raajaM sameta shrii subrahmaNyaM dhyaayaami ... "

Sri Chandrashekara Saraswati (Kanchi Shankaracharya) is said to have given a
discourse on Muthuswami Dikshitar's Subrahmanya Kriti. One line of this
kriti is "vaasuki takshakaadi sarpa svaruupa dharanaaya". He says that sarpa
literally means kundalini, both having a wriggled, spiral-like form. [
Subrahmanya has the kundalini shakti itself as his weapon, in the form of a
vel ]

In the course of his discourse, he is said to have asked rhetorically if
Shankaracharya has ever mentioned this identification. He replies that in
the Subrahmanya Bhujangam, the word "bhujangam" in the title itself refers
to a snake who uses his entire body as his hands. 

He also talks about the seeming contradictions designed to take us above
"hate". It was a poisonous snake that was used to churn the ocean for
nectar, and Subrahmanya has for his vehicle a peacock, the enemy of snakes. 

The Tirumala hills on which Lord Venkateshwara resides is also called
seshagiri. The acharya says that "sarpa svaruupa dhara" refers to
Subrahmanya as the Tirumala hill itself.
