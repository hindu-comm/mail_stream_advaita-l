Ajit Krishnan has answered this. I can only add that in the yajna context, 
the AshreShA-nakShatra-iShTi utilizes the mantras related to offerings to 
sarpa's (serpents). Also, the 4th anuvAka of the first prashna of the third 
aShTaka of the taittirIya brAhmaNa (3.1.4) contains a recommendation for 
this iShTi. The devatAs for the AshreShA nakShatra-iShTi are sarpa's and the 
AshreShA group of stars.

Anand
