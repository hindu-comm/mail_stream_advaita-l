Hari Om,

Shankara notes the above verse of Gautama in his GItA BhAshhya 5.18-19
and explains that it is referring to those who are filled with conceit
and are offended when treated equally along with those they perceive to
be inferior. Therefore, one ought not to show equal respect to all
jIvas when in the presence of those who possess conceit, but otherwise,
one may show equal respect to all living beings.

Kartik, could you kindly elaborate on why one ought not to show equal respect to all jIvas when in the presence of conceitful people? Is it the actual presence of such people that will sully the respect shown? Should we not show equal respect to all jIvas(without assuming higher moral ground) inspite of their blatant limitations as individuals ?

Hari Om,
Navin
