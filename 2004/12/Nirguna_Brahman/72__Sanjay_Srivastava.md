That makes for an interesting point. Concept of "Allah" is in fact quite 
close to vishishtadvaitin concept of maha-vishnu. Allah is the supreme 
principle on which everything depends for its existence. However as limited 
human beings, even though dependent upon Allah for our ultimate existence, 
we are expected to follow a path of dharma in order to please Allah and 
receive His grace. Ishwar-Allah quote by a vishishtadvaitin may not after 
all be just a superficial attempt to syncretism.
