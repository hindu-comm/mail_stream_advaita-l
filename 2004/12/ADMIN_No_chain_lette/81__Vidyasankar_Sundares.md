Dear Sri Ramesh (and all members in general)

Please do not forward chain letters to the whole discussion group. It is a 
matter of simple courtesy. At the very least, if you feel like sending 
something of this nature, first prune the extensive set of headers that 
results from forwarding for the Nth time and send out only the gist of the 
information.

As it was, in the email that you just sent the group, the two Slokas were 
badly and inconsistently transliterated. I would suggest visiting the 
Sanskrit documents site (sanskrit.gde.to) to get an idea of what I mean.

Vidyasankar Sundaresan
(Oon behalf of all the moderators)
