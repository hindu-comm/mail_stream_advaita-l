"... It would make more sense to keep discussions together rather than split 
them amongst
little groups."

I also think so. However I have found more than one excellent groups devoted 
to Sankara quite faithfully and I think this is inevitable on web. I myself 
am member of three such lists and have found all of them useful. Anyway, 
this message was from my teacher in Mumbai, who asked me to forward it to 
those who might be interested.

Regards,

Nav Varsha Mangalmaya ho!
