It looks like there are two different recensions of this upanishad.
however as you can see, the text dealing with adhyaropa apavada is the
same in both versions so we can be fairly sure it is a genuine Vedic text.
This upanishad is said to belong to Shuklayajurveda and there is in fact a
Paingala shakha in the Shuklayajurveda.
