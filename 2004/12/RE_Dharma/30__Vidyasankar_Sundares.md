The straightforward resolution to this debate is to look at adhikAra-bheda. 
There are those who need to act, but you also have to acknowledge that there 
are those who have transcended the need to act. And there are those at an 
intermediate stage who are in the process of gradually withdrawing from 
action - SanaiS Sanair uparamed buddhyA dhRtigRhItayA. No true advaitin 
advocates inaction through laziness or through fear of action. That would be 
nothing but tamas. What we uphold is the ultimate supremacy of the state of 
no action, where action is transcended. That is beyond tamas, rajas and 
sattva.
