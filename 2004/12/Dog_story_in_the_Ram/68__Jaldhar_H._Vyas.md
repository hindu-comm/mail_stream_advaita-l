In my edition (from Nirnayasagara press) there is a note by the editor,
Pt. V. L. Panshikar after the 59th sarga of the uttarakanda that "here
some read the story of the dog and the vulture and the owl (grdhraulakau)
however the author of the Tilaka [commentary, included in this edition]
has not commented on it so it is to be regarded as interpolated (prakshipta).
There follow three sargas consisting of 150 shlokas.  This story is in the
second of them.

The story is rendered correctly with a few minor quibbles here and
there...

...but the conclusion (there is one) has been lost.  The point is not that
being a kulapati caused rebirth as a dog but that the kulapati had no
control of his senses and was overly proud.  When one lacks control over
anger etc. then all the pious acts in the world will not cause good
fortune.  Similiarly Sarvarthasiddha (note the allegory in the name) is
cruel and quick to anger.  So despite being a learned Brahmana and a
kulapati, he will not prosper but instead will be reborn as a dog.
