The very fact that you are typing out emails and responding to points
implies that it is for such a person (engaged in Karma) that this
difference is postulated.

IF you have truly attained the status of:

"He who by means of one-pointed devotion to Liberation roots out the
attachment to sense-objects, renounces all actions, and with faith in
the Real Brahman regularly practices hearing, etc., succeeds in purging
the Rajasika nature of the intellect." (VivekachUDAmaNi 182)
