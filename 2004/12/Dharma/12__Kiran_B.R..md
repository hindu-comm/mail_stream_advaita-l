Bhaskar:

Sorry. What I meant was:

Some postulate a difference between "one who performs works such as
agnihotra" and "one who does not". When any difference is postulated,
it must be made clear as to "for whom" this difference is postulated.

The gItA negates any such difference for a particular type of person:

tyaktvA karmaphalAsaMgaM nityatRuptO nirAshrayaH |
karmaNyabhipravRuttO&pi naiva kiMchit karOti saH ||

He who has renounced the fruit of work, he who is ever contented, he
who leans on nothing, even when he is doing work, does not do
anything.

This person who is engaged in karma is the true karmayOgi, the true
sannyAsi, and for him there is no karma.

Cheers
Kiran
