I recommend to my daughter Shailaja that she drinks milk everyday to be
big and strong.  Am I a hypocrite because I myself don't drink milk
everyday in order to be big and strong?  Or is that I am already big and
strong?

In a way this is the inverse of the previous discussion.  Can someone who
is not karmanishta teach karma?  Well what is the point of karma?  This is
one of the issues where Mimamsakas and Vedantins who otherwise share many
common views on the nature of the Vedas, disagree.  For the former,
actions are an end to themselves.  They enable us to get good results and
avoid bad results.  For the latter, actions are purely a sacrifice to the
Lord.  The ultimate goal of karma is to transcend the need for karma.
Thus a sannyasi who is shrotriya and brahmanishta is the highest role
model for the karmayogi as well.
