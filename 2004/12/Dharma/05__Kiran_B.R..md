When this does:

This is not a historical fact which happened on a particular day and
captured on TV. It's right before your eyes in India. the laziness,
the weakness, the lack of cleanliness and industry when it comes to
anything this-worldy is a basic trait of our country.

And thanks, I'm done with applying industry to Vedanta. It's time you
start applying Vedanta to industry.

Cheers
Kiran
