namaste,

Is it correct to say that:

karmayogi - performs karma, gives up *attachment* to fruit of karma, however 
does receive its fruit since he identifies himself with actions.

sannyAsin - gives up nityakarma etc (and of course attachment to its fruit), 
but performs residual activities like nidhidhyAsana etc, receives its fruit.

jnAni - performs no karma, performs minimal activities required for 
sustenance of body, does not identify himself with any action, receives no 
fruit of any action.
