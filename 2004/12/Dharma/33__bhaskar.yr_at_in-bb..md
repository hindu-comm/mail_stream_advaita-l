yaM saMnyAsamiti prAhuryOgaM taM viddhi pAMDava |
na hyasanyasta saMkalpO yOgI bhavati kaSchana || (B.G. 6.2)

That which they call saMnyAsa, know that to be [karma]yOga. No one
becomes a [karma]yOgI without renouncing saMkalpa.

I think Kiran prabhuji you are right in equating kama yOgi with
saNnyAsi...While commenting on this shlOka (or the previous one ....not
sure) shankara says the same thing.  Here pUrva pakshi asks a question how
can karma saNyAsi who is upholding the pravrutti dharma can be equated with
saNyAsi who has renounced all types of karma (sarva karma saNyAsa) &
sticking to nivrutti dharma...shankara says in this context .. naisha
dOshaH....karmaphala saNkalpasaNyAsAt saNyAsitvaM....etc..(kindly check the
original commentary for the details)..Since karma yOgi renounced the karma
phala (fruits of karma) he can be treated as saNyAsi.  We can call him
*phala tyAga rUpa saNyAsi* who does the action without ahaNkAra & mamakAra
& with complete IshvarArpita bhuddhi.  Subsequently Shankara  also showers
abundant appreciation to paramArtha saNyAsa in which saNyAsi not only
renounces the karma phala but also renounces the karma itself (like agni
hOtra etc.) (shankara says sarva karma tat phala tyAga lakShaNaM paramArtha
saNyAsaM).  In short we can say, karma yOgi does the work with a jnAna that
*HE* only doing the work through him, whereas in jnAnanishTa saNyAsi who
has taken paramArtha saNyAsa,  this katrutva bhAva itself been sublated.
In anyway, both are not the victims of karma phala baNdhana.  In that sense
both are one & the same.


Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
