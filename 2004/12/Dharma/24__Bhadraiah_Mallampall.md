Dear Sri. Kiran B.R.,

>Please note that I do recognize that the word sanyasi is also used to name 
>the fourth Ashrama.

Thanks for clarifying. Gitacharya said somewhere, 'I am the beginning 
premise in an argument'.

I was thinking that any one who puts on saffron clothes is a sanyasi :-)

(Is there a glossary of words used in tradition?)

Best regards
Bhadraiah
