The beauty of logic is it doesn't depend on appearences.

That's a straw man you are raising.  "There is no crisis" doesn't imply
"nothing needs to be done" only that what needs to be done (and eventually
not done) should be determined by intelligence not blind panic.

"such people" act _in_comparison_ to those who are niragni etc.  The
hierarchy is this:

Tamasic people only act out of laziness.  They will only make effort to
avoid effort.

Rajasic people act for the sake of action.  They expect results for their
actions.

Sattvic people act out of duty.  They are yogis.  Then as the final act
they renounce ation.  They are sannyasis.

Again, the import of this shloka is that just giving up is not sannyasa.
What is left out here but is the central theme of Advaita Vedanta is that
giving up with understanding is sannyasa and it is the only path to
moksha.

Repeat he _appears_ to work.  As you yourself point out later.  This is a
subtle but important difference because it establishes the relative values
of work and non-work.

Out of compassion for those who are inferior?

Do you have children?  If you tell a child not to touch scissors or knives
are you an upholder of the inferior because one day they will have to use
knives and scissors?  The good teacher adjusts his lesson to fit the
student.  If you read the Mahabharata you'll notice that Arjuna is not the
brightest guy around.  Yet eventually he along with his brothers does take
sannyasa.  So evidently the lesson did sink in!

He is giving an example to Arjuna.  Arjuna is the one who is being urged
to work.

I have a question: if Krishna is so fond of work, why in the middle of
this tumultuous battle is he sitting in a chariot minding horses?  Surely
a few well-placed thunderbolts could have reduced the Mahabharata from
100,000 shlokas to 1,000.

????? so the whole point of this diatribe on advaita-l is to encourage
dieting?

5.8-10 The first two shlokas don't describe a karmayogi, they describe a

Knower of truth is a poor translation for tattvavid.  Tattvas are the
constituent building blocks, "elements" if you will, of the universe.  Try
"knower of reality" instead.  Only some of the karmayogis are tattvavids.

>"pontificates"

manyeta is also mistranslated.  It is the verb man "to think" in the case
called ling (sorry I can't remember what the English grammatical
equivalent is.  Imperative maybe?)  So "should think"

So this is the program that the tattvavid has to practice.  Learning to
restrain the senses in all their multiplicity and negate them.  When this
is done, one is ready for sannyasa.

The chief stumbling block the future sannyasi is the idea that "If I give
up action I will commit a sin."  In this shloka Bhagavan assures us that
it is is only the attachment to results that leads to sin.  We can deduce
the following sequence of growth in the seeker.

karmi -> karmayogi -> tattvavid -> sannyasi

I don't know of one reader of this list who isn't out to improve
themselves so if you are feeling guilty about such things perhaps you
should discuss it on some psychology-related forum not advaita-l?

This shloka merely says that renunciation of action is a superset of
renunciation of fruits of action.  In other words one cannot take up
sannyasa in anticipation of some reward.  In the first adhyaya Arjuna asks
Krishna Bhagavan if he shouldn't just concede the kingdom to Duryodhana
rather than fight him?  That type of "renunciation" would be cowardice not
true sannyasa.
