I think Prakash meant the blame to fall on both parties.  I for one stand
by what I said.  You have not done your homework on this.  All the
points you raised were anticipated by our acharyas from day one.  I'm not
saying it is impossible to come up with a novel point of view but to try
and do so in this day and age without acknowledging the prior art is
simply negligent and I would be remiss not to point that out.
