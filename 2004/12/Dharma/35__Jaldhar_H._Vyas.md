Yes which is why Arjuna eventually retires from his kingdom and takes
sannyasa.

No obviously not.  Yet when the student graduates, the cave is where he
ends up.  Like Arjuna.

So why does that matter?  The work would get done.  Could it be the Lord
has some other motive than just work?

Also don't forget the many times Krishna Bhagavan sat there minding the
horses when something could have been done.  Why the "capriciousness"?  Do
you think He is so cruel that He would torture His creations for sport?

That doesn't follow at all.  The shloka also makes grammatical sense if
samnayasa involves yoga plus something more.

You ask.  Don't kid yourself that you are getting any support from Advaita
Vedantic tradition for such eccentric ideas.

Your argument is illogical because you are changing terms in the
middle of it.  When Advaita Vedanta speaks of the superiority of sannyasa
it is speaking of sarvakarmasannyasa.  This is a superset of
karmaphalasannyasa.

Noone is a college graduate who is not a highschool graduate.  Does it
seem strange to you that we refer to one who has completed high school as
a graduate?  Does that make him equivalent to a college graduate just
because both have the word graduate in their titles?

Not for sannyasa in the way Krishna Bhagavan intends.  And He does intend
to make a distinction or else the use of two terms yoga and sannyasa would
suffer from the defect of redundancy.

Exactly.  I wouldn't say idol though.  But sannyasa is the future of the
karmayogi, the state he is heading for.  Just like Arjuna.

This is just a variant on the age old argument against jivanmukti and the
answer is the same.  What apparent actions take place are just the last
gasps of prarabdha karma.  The sannyasi doesn't act further or produce
karmaphala.

...and after that there are no more points.  It's a different game.
