I am forwarding a message from Vivek Shankar to the list. If you receive the 
digest form of the list, please take care to excerpt only the post to which 
you respond. Including the entire digest in your response makes it too big 
and the list software will complain.

Dear Prof V.K ji as well as other fellow advaitha jignasus,

I congrajulate you on the sucessful completion of the mahatkaryam you 
undertook.
It would be worthwhile to explore the possibility of  making the whole of 
the
series available as one document form( maybe PDF) or as a souveneir.

Once again, many grateful thanks to Prof V.K.ji

Shree Matra Namaha

Vivek
