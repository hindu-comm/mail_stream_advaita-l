That seems like the best explanation of the term. It is very common to refer 
to the state of moksha as "viShNoH paramam padam". The word viShNu here need 
not be taken as a reference to viShNu with form. Rather, it refers to the 
upaniShadic statements that having created the universe, brahman enters it. 
The verb root "viS" means to enter, and therefore Brahman is called viShNu. 
However, although Brahman enters the universe, as it were, it remains apart 
and unaffected. The term "param padam" draws our attention to this.
