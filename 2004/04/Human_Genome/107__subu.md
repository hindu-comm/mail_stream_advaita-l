Namaskaram,

Does the success of the Human Genome project and decoding of the human genes
can be presented as a case study of the Advaitha philosophy. This also very
clearly states that God did not sit and create human being and but God is a
process an eternal process which is in turn truth. The Genome project also
states those codes which make a Human genes and these codes/protien talked
to each other as a part of evolution and made the Human Gene Signature.

(Please correct me)

Jaya Jaya Sankara Hara Hara Sankara.

Thank you
