Please refer to Tithi Nirnaya Kaandam (One of the Six Kaandams - volumes) of
SriVaidyanatha Deekshiteeyam for further information on deciding the dates
and times for various festivals and fasts. A gist of the same can be found
in Sankshepa Dharma Shastram - a book published by Bhagavan nama
publications, Chennai.

Best regards
Anand K
