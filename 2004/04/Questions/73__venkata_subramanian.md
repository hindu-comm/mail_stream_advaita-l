i am not sure of the date of the Magazine, but i remember having studied in one Shankara Kripa ( a magazine that was once published by Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam) that, it was H.H.The Sringeri Jagadguru Sri Sachidananda Shiva Abhinava Bharathi Swami who ordained that the celebration for 5 days from Vaishaka Amavasya to Panchami of Sri Shankara Jayanthi.  It is followed in spirit even today.

Thus, it is the Jagadguru's Angnya which has been followed everywhere.

Jaldhar - I think there is a typo in your posting.

Saturday is 24th April. Did you mean Saturday or Sunday (25th)?

Thanks,
Ravi
