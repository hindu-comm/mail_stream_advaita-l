Yes, the date for Sankara Jayanti is as determined by Sri Saccidananda 
Sivabhinava Narasimha Bharati Swami of Sringeri. At the beginning of the 
20th century, the exact location of Kaladi was largely unknown and the tithi 
of Adi Sankara's birth was also unknown. Conflicting details were found in 
the various Sankaravijaya texts. So the Acharya resorted to the kaTapayAdi 
saMkhyA scheme and applied it to the name Sankara. Accordingly, the numbers 
obtained are 5, 1 and 2. Hence, he decided that the fifth day (pancamI) of 
the first fortnight (Sukla paksha) of the second month (vaiSakha) should be 
observed as the Sankara Jayanti day.
