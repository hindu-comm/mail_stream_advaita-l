How will you verify that your AchArya's words are true? By examining them logically/rationally or by experiencing? The former is a bit shaky, for rationalism can be sometimes subjective. (For some, "God exists" is rational, while for others, "God does not exist" is rational, and so on). If the latter, how would you know when to stop your verification process in case the AchArya's words are false? Like, say, if you follow some vasihNava school and you dont reach vaikunTha after sometime. Would you conclude that it is a false school and turn to other paths or would you continue to experiment?
