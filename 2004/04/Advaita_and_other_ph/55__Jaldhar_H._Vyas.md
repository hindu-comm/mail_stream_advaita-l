That's not the reason.  Duality is a given.  It is the "natural" state of
the maya-befuddled person.  Take the Vedic dictum tat tvam asi (you are
that.)  "tat" and "tvam" are known in advance.  Advaita vedantas'
contribution is "asi"  This is the link that makes the two terms not-two.

Dvaita in the term Dvaita Vedanta has an entirely different meaning.

There is evidence that there were non-advaitic strains of Vedanta before
Shankaracharya but if it is not very clear if they have anything to do
with the darshans of the present day.  For instance some fragments of
bhashyas on Gita and Brahmasutras by one Bhaskara Mishra survive.  He was
evidently a Vaishnava and advocated bhedabhedavada but I don't think he
was a Shrivaishnava and in any case later exponents of that tradition took
any notice of him.

We can also independently confirm some figures mentioned in Shrivaishnava
literature as forerunners of Ramanuja e.g. Bodhayana (not the sutrakara)
so Vishishtadvaita can make some claim to antiquity.  I don't think Dvaita
can do so.

The Vaishnava schools have mostly spent their energy on attacking us
rather than each other.  Which is really a back-handed compliment to us
isn't it?
