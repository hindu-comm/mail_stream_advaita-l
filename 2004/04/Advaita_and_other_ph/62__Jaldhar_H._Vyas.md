Least of all by me.  But I personally have and found examined the answers
(Proof: see some other things I've written on this list :-)

Point of information: ahamkara means ego or sense of "I" if someone is
"programmed" they are not acting from conscious volition so the question
of ahamkara does not arise.  Some of our yogic techniques are specifically
designed for such "programming."

Of course it has its drawbacks too so the Advaitic approach to
epistemology is more sophisticated than "receive everything the AchArya
says as absolute Truth"

What if after all this my beliefs are wrong?  I'll cross that bridge when
I get to it.  One should be flexible enough to admit when one is wrong.
But to to keep wondering "what if I'm wrong?" is just a rhetorical pose
and not necessary.

Well yes it does.  Acharya means one who shows achar or the right way.  If
one doesn't believe a particular person is showing the right way either
because one knows a better way or because one doesn't care for it, then
that person is not an acharya.

You are reading way too much into the word "inferior" Though it can do so
it needn't imply that I think the inferior others are totally useless or
can be ignored or that sort of thing.  Tolerance is a great thing and I
don't want to go back to the days of e.g. the Mughal emperor Shah Jehan
when Dashanami and Tridandi sannyasis fought pitched battles.  But it
seems to me the Moderns have a malady that's equally harmful -- a deep
fear of committing to anything.  To be "judgemental" is the new deadly
sin.  But that only leads to paralysis.  If one believes there is such a
thing as truth, then one has to find a way towards it and just as
importantly *away* from untruth.  What I'm claiming is that Advaita
Vedanta is that way.

Kiran, the thing is the other darshans don't even agree there is a circle
to reach the center of.  Now geometry has its own innate charm but if I'm
looking for a circle, I can't substitute a pentagon can I?

Then "ultimately" that's what I'll do.  But in the meantime it's time for
Shankara Jayanti!
