Then this is not knowledge.

Certainly my knowledge of Advaita Vedanta says nothing about knowledge of
say baking a cake.  But Dvaitins, vishistadvaitins etc. claim to be
talking about the same Brahmasutras upanishads etc. as we are.

I think we are talking about two seperate types.  The one who just
mindlessly follows without reflection is indicative of a tamasic
personality.  The one who is builds a cult of personality around the guru
is rajasic.  It is this type which is affected by ahamkar.  The tamasic
type has a pathological lack of ahamkar.

The distinction is important because the means of getting away to a more
sattvic personality are different for each type.

Are you Kiran?  When answering this question did you stop to think
that you might not be Kiran?  I bet you didn't.  Now what is so
dangerous about your unwavering belief that you are Kiran?

Certainty is only dangerous...when it is dangerous.  skepticism can be
powerful but it can also be an excuse for intellectual paralysis.

This may be true about some things (note we are discussing this via the
new-fangled internet not palm leaves.) but Brahman is beyond space and
time.  Sandhyavandana, bhajans, ekadashi etc. are beyond space and time.
So where are the grounds for second-guessing what the Acharya would or
would not have done?

See you are doing exactly what you warned against -- making inferences
beyond the facts at your disposal.  How do you know the sudarshan chakra
is not more powerful than a nuclear weapon?  The truth is we don't have
enough data on the subject.

And this is the crux of the matter.  Forget modern-traditional,
dvaita-advaita etc.  The philosophical fault-line is between those who
think that truth is absolute and those that think it is relative.  It
should be quite obvious that Shankaracharya and other classical Advaita
authors did think there was an absolute truth.  They didn't hesitate to
criticize others who they thought were deviating from that truth.

If truth is undefined, how do you know its opposite  varies?

we think that the truth in everbody is universal and use that as the
yardstick.
