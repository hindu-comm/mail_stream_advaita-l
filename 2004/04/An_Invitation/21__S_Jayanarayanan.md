Thanks for the invite. I searched for info about this list on the web
and found this comment about the forum at
http://www.hindunet.com/forum/showthreaded.php?Cat=&Number=41354&page=&view=&sb=5&o=&vc=1

"I have been subscribed to vadavali. But I am unfortunately not seeing
any vada let alone any dialogue within the two main schools in your
forum. Instead one particular school is bombarding the members of the
other school with abuses and are trying to ridicule the other school's
philosophy. I don't think this ridiculing the opposite school will
glorify their own philosophy. Instead, I am sorry to say, vadavali is
now nearly a farce. It is more like 'Dvaitavali'."

I've subscribed to it anyway!
