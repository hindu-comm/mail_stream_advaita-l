Dear  Saadhakas ,

Taking  the  risk  of  being  laughed  at ( ! ) , since  this  is  an  ADVAITA  list ,  I  who  am  a  Bhakta  at  heart  though  a  firm  believer  in  Advaita ,  must  point  out  Shrimad  Aachaarya ' s  brilliance  in  Stotra  writing .
Even  small  stotras  like  the  Shri  Shiva Panchaaksharastotra , or  Shri  Ganesha Pancharatnastotra  reveal  His  depth  of  learning .  What  is  more  apparent  is  His  animitta karunaa  since  1200  or  2500  years ago , He  anticipated  our  predicament , and  wrote  such  simple  prayers  for  us .
Then  again  the  jnaanis  among  us  needn't  despair ; He  has  given  them  food  for  thought  with  the  three  incomparable  stotras : Shri  Dakshinaamoorti  Stotra , Shri  Gauri  Dashakam  and  Shri Harimidestotra .
It  is  clear  that  His  compositions  are  not  pre-meditated , rather  all  the  compositions  have  raw  appeal , the  common  thread  being  that  the  devoted  heart  is  touched . He  says ,"  Lakshminrisimha  mama  dehi  karaavalambana . " This  is  so  touching . Elsewhere , He  pleads , " Jagannaathasvaami  nayanapathagaami  bhavatu  may ."

Let  us  remember  the  great  Aachaarya  as  not  just  a  JNAANINAAM  AGRAGANYA , but  also  as  a  BHAKTAKULASHIROMANI .

BHAVA  SHANKARA  DESHIKA  MAY  SHARANAM .

With  Love ,

Rohit  N. Ubhayaker .

Abolutely True !

Indeed Marvellous is He. On the Jayanthi day, i read his Commentary on "Sathyam, Jnanam, Anantham Brahma" occuring in Thaiterya Upanishad. That simple but cursor like sharpness expression, is some thing to be personally enjoyed by oneself.

how he relates the three expressions to Brahman, and his explanations there, all make us to just sit and long for some Srothriya Brahma Nishta Guru to guide us over a true Sravana, only wherein will we get initiated into the inner depths.

Wow his Greatness. Only with His Grace, one can understand what He says.....

Sringeri Jagadguru Sri Sachidananda Shiva Abhivana Narasimha Bharathi Maha Swami's Shankara Padavalamba Stotra ...(the bigger one) published in Bhakti Sudha Tarangini takes us to feel what really Great that Acharya is.

We are really fortunate that we are aware of Him.

Dear Saadhakas ,

Very sorry ( better late than never ) , but a belated "HAPPY SHANKARA JAYANTI" to everyone .

Two and a half years ago , I visited the Himaalayan shrines of Shri Kedaaranaatha and Shri Badarinaatha . The drive from Hrishikesha to both these places really opened my eyes to the greatness of our Aachaarya . I had always loved Him even before my pilgrimage , but the magnitude of His various achievements viz. the re-establishment of the temple of Shri Badarinaatha ( and others throughout India ) , the writing of spiritual classics , the establishment of Mathas at various far-flung places ( including Shri Jyotirmatha in the mountains ) , the establishment of the Six Faiths , the debates , the ascension of the Sarvajnapeetha , public discourses , the list is unending , opened my eyes ( blinded them with radiance! ) to His glory .

What a life ! What a trailblazer ( Deshika ).

In terms of sheer achievements , I personally think no other Avataara except Shri Krishna can be compared to our Aachaarya !

Words fail to describe His glory . 

So respectful silence is the best tribute to Him .

BHAVA SHANKARA DESHIKA MAY SHARANAM .
BHAVA SHANKARA DESHIKA MAY SHARANAM.
BHAVA SHANKARA DESHIKA MAY SHARANAM .

With Love , 

Rohit N. Ubhayaker .
