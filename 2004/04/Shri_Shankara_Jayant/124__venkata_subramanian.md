Abolutely True !

Indeed Marvellous is He.   On the Jayanthi day, i read his Commentary on "Sathyam, Jnanam, Anantham Brahma" occuring in Thaiterya Upanishad.   That simple but cursor like sharpness expression, is some thing to be personally enjoyed by oneself.

how he relates the three expressions to Brahman, and his explanations there, all make us to just sit and long for some Srothriya Brahma Nishta Guru to guide us over a true Sravana, only wherein will we get initiated into the inner depths.

Wow his Greatness.   Only with His Grace, one can understand what He says.....

Sringeri Jagadguru Sri Sachidananda Shiva Abhivana Narasimha Bharathi Maha Swami's Shankara Padavalamba Stotra ...(the bigger one) published in Bhakti Sudha Tarangini takes us to feel what really Great that Acharya is.

We are really fortunate that we are aware of Him.

Dear Saadhakas ,

Very sorry ( better late than never ) , but a belated "HAPPY SHANKARA JAYANTI" to everyone .

Two and a half years ago , I visited the Himaalayan shrines of Shri Kedaaranaatha and Shri Badarinaatha . The drive from Hrishikesha to both these places really opened my eyes to the greatness of our Aachaarya . I had always loved Him even before my pilgrimage , but the magnitude of His various achievements viz. the re-establishment of the temple of Shri Badarinaatha ( and others throughout India ) , the writing of spiritual classics , the establishment of Mathas at various far-flung places ( including Shri Jyotirmatha in the mountains ) , the establishment of the Six Faiths , the debates , the ascension of the Sarvajnapeetha , public discourses , the list is unending , opened my eyes ( blinded them with radiance! ) to His glory .

What a life ! What a trailblazer ( Deshika ).

In terms of sheer achievements , I personally think no other Avataara except Shri Krishna can be compared to our Aachaarya !

Words fail to describe His glory . 

So respectful silence is the best tribute to Him .

BHAVA SHANKARA DESHIKA MAY SHARANAM .
BHAVA SHANKARA DESHIKA MAY SHARANAM.
BHAVA SHANKARA DESHIKA MAY SHARANAM .

With Love , 

Rohit N. Ubhayaker .
