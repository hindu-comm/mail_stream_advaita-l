In my considered opinion, no.

The decoding of the human genome says nothing about God creating or not 
creating. For that matter, there are other genome projects going on, 
Drosophila (fruit fly), mouse, cattle etc. Biological evolution does not 
suddenly start with genes and proteins in the human species. It involves all 
species, from the simplest protozoa and bacteria to mammals.

As far as advaita is concerned, we do not say that God is an eternal process 
at all. Rather, truly knowing Brahman is a return to the stillness at the 
center of the process of activity. The truth lies in the stillness, not in 
the process, whether on a day-to-day basis or on an evolutionary timescale 
of millions of years.
