Dear Shri Ramaswamy,

Saadaranamaskaarah. I can get you a xerox copy of the book Atmavidya Vilasah of Sri Sadasiva Brahmendra, published in 1958 by the Sri Kamakoti Kosasthanam, Madras with translation in Tamil provided a copy is given to the Veda Pathasala Library at Chathapuram, Palakkad.
This is for preserving a copy for futurity.

Best regards: ramanathan
