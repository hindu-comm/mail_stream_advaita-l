Regarding the topic of[nirgunam-sagunam],[sakara-nirakara]

Gaudapada in his karika comments on the word ‘nirvikaram’ in the alanthasanthi chapter 74 th verse. He says Brahman is beyond modification which means beyond time [because cause and effect are within time]. Really speaking Brahman cannot be called nirvikaram also—this word is used from vyavahara drshti only. From vyavahara drshti we say Brahman is jagat karanam and ‘nirvikaram’ is used only to negate savikaram. Once savikaram is negated then the word nirvikaram becomes irrelevant. All brahman’s description as ‘nir---‘ etc are only to negate the misconception. From turiyam stand point no word can be used, not even ‘advaitam’ as advaitam has a meaning only with reference dvaitam. Silence or amatra can only be used to indicate that absolute state, this silence is not absence of sounds as that would also fall within dvandva, it has to be that which illumines both relative silence and sounds.
