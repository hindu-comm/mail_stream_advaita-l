Thank you very much for this wonderful post. When I was a small boy, my 
mother made me learn reciting the slokas under the tutelage of Painganadu 
Srinivasa Sastrigal. I do recite it from time to time. After several years, 
when I approached Sastrigal to learn the meaning of the slokas, he could not 
accept my request as he was going to take sanyasa ashrama and move to 
Varanasi.

It has been really wonderful to learn the meaning of the slokas and the 
hidden concepts behind them. Thank you very much for enlightening us on this 
subject. My prayers to Mother Lalitha for giving you more time and energy to 
produce more such documents for our sake.

God bless,
Ravi
