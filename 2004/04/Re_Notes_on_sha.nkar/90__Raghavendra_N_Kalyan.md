Namaste SrI Balasubramainan-gaaru,

I appreciate your timely post driving home the most important vedAntic concept that all forms of saguNa brahman are the same. You also wrote -

Is the above valid for someone who "has just heard" (not yet realized) that everything is brahman? 

What about meditation on everything as the non-heterogenous brahman for such a person? 

Thanks and Regards
Raghavendra
