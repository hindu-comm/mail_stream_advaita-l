I recently saw a quotation (while studying chamakam[1]), which said that
among the devata-s agni is the lowest and vishhNu is the highest [2]. This
was used in the context of agnAvishhNu in the starting of chamakam -saying
that the term agnAvishhNu  represents all devata-s starting from the lowest
to the highest.

Should this be interpreted differently?

TIA.

[1] Book on mahaanyaasam published by mylapore veda adhyayana sabha. It is
good book (Sanskrit+Tamil) and distributed free of charge. They also have
very nice booklets on brahma yaj~na, upAkarma etc.
