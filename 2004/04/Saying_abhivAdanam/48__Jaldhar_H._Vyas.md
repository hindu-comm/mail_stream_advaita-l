abhivandana via email seems ok to me if it is one on one.  I agree it
should not be said to a group.  But if something has been done
wrong inadvertantly rather than out of malice Bhagavan will forgive it. So
I think those of us who are Brahmanas should (mentally) wish Subrahmanya
"AyuShmAna bhava saumya" ("May you have long life dear one", which is how
I was told to do prativandana.)
