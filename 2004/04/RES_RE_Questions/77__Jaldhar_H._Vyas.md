I can think of two reasons why:

1) Because that was an easier question to answer :-)

2) Because the circumstances of each persons life are so different it is
   not possible to give one pat answer.

Actually I think we did touch upon this the last time you asked.  The key
word is vairagya.  To decrease as much as possible the attachment to the
non-real and finite is to live an Advaitic life.  The easiest way is to
simply become a monk.  But actually for most people that's not so easy!
