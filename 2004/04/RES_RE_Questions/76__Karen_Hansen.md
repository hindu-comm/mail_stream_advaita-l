We have a local Ramakrishna- Vivekananda Vedanta Society here, and I plan
to ask the Swami if he can teach me how to meditate and how to advance in
my spiritual life as an Advaitan. You might not have the same advantage,
but it is my understanding that beginners must begin from where they are.
Your questions are valid, and deserve discernible answers. How does an
Advaitan live? That is a very good question.
