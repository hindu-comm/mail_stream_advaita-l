Dear  Saadhakas ,

Vishnupada  means  the  state  of  being  Vishnu . Vishnu , however  is  not  different  from    being  Vishnu . Brahman  reflected  by  the  illusory   effect  of  Maayaa  appears  as  Eeshvara  and  the  jeeva - jagat . The  Eeshvara  aspect  knows  His  identity  as  Advaitatattva . This  knowledge is  knowledge - cum - realization . So  Vishnu , Shiva ,etc  know  Their  oneness  with  Brahman.

Again , the  one  who  knows  Brahman  "becomes"  Brahman  himself .

So , it  may  be  said  that  Vishnu  ( or  Shiva )  is  Brahma  by  the  above  logic . So  it  may  mean  that  by  Vishnupada  this  state  of  Vishnu  i.e.  His  experience  of  Brahman .

BHAVA   SHANKAR  DESHIKA  MAY  SHARANAM

With  Love , 

 Rohit  Ubhayaker.

Jaldhar, there is no doubt that the "highest place of VishhNu" can be
taken as the place of Ishvara, etc. But the question was:

---
"The Sutra declares that at the dissolution of Brahmaloka the souls,
which by that time have attained knowledge, along with the Saguna
Brahman attain what is *** higher than the Saguna Brahman, i.e., para
Brahman or the pure highest place of Visnu ***"
...But how come, Sri AdiShankaracharya mentioned supreme brahman in the
form of Vishnu in IV.3.10 commentry, which is a Saguna form of Brahman?
---

I find it extremely strange that Shankara would choose the term
"VishhNu" to refer to the nirguNa Brahman when specifically
DIFFERENTIATING it from saguNa Brahman! I think the question asked is
very valid and still unanswered.

PS: In your own reply, you've repeatedly spoken of "VishhNu Bhagavan" -
NOT nirguNa Brahman.
