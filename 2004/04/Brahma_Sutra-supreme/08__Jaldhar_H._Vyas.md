In general no, but in this sutra yes.  It is discussing the passages in
chhandogyopanishad which state the released souls go to the world of
Prajapati and then proceed to the final moksha at pralaya.  The puranic
motif of Brahma and Padmanabha Vishnu Bhagavan would make a good
illustration of that concept.

The particular deities in question may be equally Vedic but not
necessarily their followers!

We have discussed this on the list before.  Unfortunately it is still a
dark mystery as to why Brahma never became as popular as Visnu or Mahesh.
I don't think Shankaracharya believed only Vedic yajnas were a path to
krama-mukti.  In fact in the adhikarana against the vyuhavada, he mentions
temple worship as being one of the customs of the Bhagavatas and states
that such things are not to be condemned only their philosophical views.
