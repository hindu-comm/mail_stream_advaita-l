I here want to clarify something that i heard of Saguna-Nirguna and similar
sayings.
Saguna means gunas associated with form.
Nirguna means not no-gunas but one having all of them -undistinguising
kind.
Similar goes with Sakar-Nirrakar.
Because everthing comes from the one and everything goes in one or
everthing is one. Saguna- cannot come from Nirguna if nir-guna means
no-qualities.
I would like to make this more clear to me.

Regards
Darshan
