Imagine you are flying over the ocean.  If you are looking down from a
great height it may seem that it is perfectly flat and calm.  As you
descend you will see that it is actually in constant turmoil and has
waves, foam, boats etc.  How did these things "grow" from the flatness?
They didn't, the observers perspective changed.  The superimposition
(adhyasa) of gunas on the guna-less is due to the flawed perspective of
the observer.
