I can understand that the "highest place of VishhNu" is mukti, which is
nirguNa Brahman. However:

Are you saying that saguNa Brahman is essentially BrahmA =
hiraNyagarbha? What about VishhNu in vaikuNTha or Shiva in KailAsa, are
they not saguNa forms of Brahman? I don't have exact references with
me, but I'm certain several advaitins (such as appayya dIkshita) have
written about VishhNu as saguNa Brahman. Even the advaita-VedAnta
homepage FAQ at http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/ad_faq.html says:

"...vishNu, Siva, Sakti, gaNapati and sUrya are worshipped as forms of
saguNa brahman."

I believe there are as many (if not more) prayers in the Vedas to
prajApati-alias-HiraNyagarbha as there are to VishhNu, so there can be
no question of one worship being "more Vedic" than the other.

OTOH, here are some speculations:

Since HiraNyagarbha-worship is only in the Karma-KANDa portion of the
Vedas, it MAY be that ONLY Vedic ritualistic worship of
HiraNyagarbha(=saguNa Brahman) leads to krama-mukti. Is this why
smArtas do not worship BrahmA in the temples -- because
HiraNyagarbha-worship should not be non-Vedic (since temple worship is
not purely Vedic)?
