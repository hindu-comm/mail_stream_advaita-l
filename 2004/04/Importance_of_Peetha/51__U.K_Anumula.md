I am grateful to the friend who threw considerable light on the question of 
Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham.

I would like the erudite members of this forum to throw some light on the 
aims and functions of the various peethams, including those set up by Adi 
Sankara.  If they were set up as overseers of ritualistic religion, that 
would perhaps be against the spirit of rational debate and discussion and 
self-realisation which Adi Sankara expounded and which are at the root of 
advaita philosophy.   Secondly, advaita does not accept pontifical 
institutions, like the papacy for Catholic Christians.  If, on the other 
hand, they are meant to guide the laity in better understanding of advaitic 
concepts, are they serving that purpose?

I wish to be excused for raising this question.  Are the peethams serving 
any purpose?
