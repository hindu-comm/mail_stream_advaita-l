Dear Fellow Advaitha Jignasus,

   What are the major contributions of the four principal mutts? Some mutts seem more involved in court battles as opposed to some that a problem of succession. 
   What have been the institutional arrnagments that been used to enusre the continuity of the mutts?
   Specifically in south India, there are two mutts that command a sizeable following? They are the traditional Dakshinamnya Sringeri Sharada Peetam as well as the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetma.? What is the nature of the relationship between the two mutts?

Warm regards



Vivek Natarajan
