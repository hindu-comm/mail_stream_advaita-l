Personally I do think that Kanchis' claim to be one of the original even
the central Math established by Adya Shankaracharya is not tenable.
However you are right that the lineage of sannyasis whose names end in
*indra Saraswati is older.  There is literary evidence for atleast 400
years as you mentioned.

However...

...this I agree with 100%.

By the way, I also don't agree with the Dwarka maths figures either (which
incidently contradict some of their own earlier publications which
acknowledge the 788-820 AD date) so this is not just a matter of party
politics for me.

Much of history is murky enough that any number of things can be claimed.
So we should be careful not treat speculations as facts especially when
it's not relevent to the purpose of Advaita Vedanta.
