I don't want to get enmeshed in arguments on the authenticity of the
Kanchi Math, but some points are not true in this post:

The biography of prime importance to four of the Shankara Maths --
Sringeri, Badri, Dwaraka and Puri -- the "Shankara dig-vijayam"
authored by Swami Vidyaranya, does NOT mention the Kanchi Math. 

Besides, the Sringeri Acharyas are firm in their stand that Kanchi
originated as a branch of Sringeri. Therefore, to claim that the
history of the Kanchi Math was lost due to "rewriting of Indian history
by the British" is simply overlooking historical and traditional
accounts by the other four Maths all of which ignore the Kanchi Math
completely.

The introduction to the English translation of the "Shankara
dig-vijayam" published by the Ramakrishna Math rightly notes that the
"dasha-nAmi sannyAsins" are so grounded in tradition in ALL the four
authentic Shankara Maths that the Kanchi Math has some serious
explaining to do when they claim that the "additional set" of
sannyAsins starting with "Indra Sarasvati" really did exist as part of
the tradition.

But Sthala Puranas are distinguished from the Maha-Puranas. No one
every equates the former to the latter.

In the same manner, the Kanchi Math derives its lineage from the
Sringeri Math. Where is the problem with understanding or accepting
this?
