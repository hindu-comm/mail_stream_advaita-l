The purpose of my message was not to initiate any new chain of arguments on this subject. 



I wish to clarify first that I did not write my message from the position of any particular mutt. So the references to your math ,your friends etc seem to be based on a misconception of my position. 



Given the nature of this historical issue, an objective conclusion can be made only by relying on books, copper plates, other evidence which were in public knowledge even before the controversy arose. Any book, copper plate etc, even if  supposedly 300 or 400 years old , if brought to public knowledge after such a controversy arose, could never be taken as objective and authentic.



There is no doubt that one should respect any institution or individual which/who  plays a major role in spreading Vedic Dharma (so long as there are no baseless antiquity claims.)



Shining examples of such great personalities are Ramana Maharishi, Swami Chinmayananda, Swami Sivananda- to name a few.



Looking at this issue from another angle  



1) if indeed a Mutt had its origin from the great Sankara

2) if indeed a Mutt had an unbroken line of succession from origin till date ( 2500 years or whatever)

3) if indeed a Mutt commanded the respect and reverence of people as a Sankara Mutt all those 2500 years,

4) if indeed a Mutt always had solid evidence on dates of gurus-birth,sanyasa,Samadhi etc all those years,



 -  Why should  a public debate arise as to whether it is authentic Sankarite or not,

 -  why should one be urged to  study books and copper plates to believe in the Mutts antiquity,

 -  why at all should this debate arise  in the last 100 plus years if people had known well  this Mutt all the time.



An objective thinker would find  the logical answer easily.

As also the origins of other mutts which seem to have been established by 
the same Adi Sankara across several centuries (with 3 of them 5 centuries 
before the advent of Christ and one after 7 centuries after Christ). How 
many Sankaras should have existed?

How many oral traditions are you talking here?

That is one oral major tradition, which is certainly very strong. My 
respects to the followers of this tradition.

Why do not you look at other books written by people who lived at least a 
century before even the so-called Kumbakonam mutt was established (in 
1800s), including traditional accounts on Sri Sankara's life?

Unfortunately this tradition is from Sri Sadasiva Brahmendra Saraswathy 
Swamigal (acknowledged to be the biggest mystic in several centuries by all 
Sankaracharyas and other yogis). This is at least 400 years old.

That should not matter. What matters is how much Kanchi mutt works for the 
preservation of Vedic Dharma.

That is interesting, how did they manage that? They seem to have done a bad 
job, because today we are talking about this.

Can you find evidence that Dwaraka mutt was established before 2500 years? 
Please try selling your idea that Adi Sankara was born after Christ to His 
Holiness Dwaraka Sankaracharya and let us know what His Holiness thinks 
about it.

Some of your friends in the internet think that such a war did not happen at 
all. You should talk to them before you find which one of you is right.

Please do not accept. The reason for forgetting does not seem to be strong 
enough.

Too bad.
Who asked you not to test any piece of evidence? If you know of only one 
copper plate, you should look for more. Where there is a will, there is a 
way. If you want to be dogmatic, any piece of evidence will not mean 
anything to you.

It is futile to contest with a dogmatic person. Before you talk anything 
logically, please go and check your math and see what tradition holds, and 
whether the tradition adds up correctly, and whether to quote tradition for 
logic.

Sorry everyone, I am not rude by nature.

I will not enter into an argument, but I cannot see people coming with an 
agenda to do mudslinging. If you have the scientific spirit, please go and 
verify (even now it is not too late) any claims of Kanchi mutt, before you 
come and write anything. You will be able to see a different dimension to 
the great preceptor Sri Adi Sankara's life.


God Bless,
Ravi
