Dear Prof-ji,

This yajna which you had conducted was indeed majestic.
After I started reading your digest, I placed the picture of Devi in my puja
room. Earlier it was incomplete!

Scores of praNams at your feet.

Hari Om

Subject: [Advaita-l] Announcing Termination of Soundaryalahari Digest

> from the advaitin group, ambaa group,  advaita-L group and
> Sadhana_Shakti group who have encouraged me and helped me
> constructively. There are also friends and relatives
> outside these groups who have done so. I stand indebted to
