I was following up this dialogue, let me add a bit what I feel,
Correct me if I am wrong.
This was a very important discussion, no theory is useful without practicals. 
And Is Vedanta practical ?

Vedanta forms the foundation theory like physics. The Bhagwad Geeta forms 
the practical science based on Vedanta. Like we have Engineering
disciplines based on Pure Science.

Vedanta hence is applicable at intellectual level, and how we realize
the goal is indicated in the various Chapters of Geeta.
Note: Each Chapter in Gita is called as "Yoga".[One of the meanings of
Yoga is State of existence]

Whatever we comprehend through Vedanta is utterly Useless unless we
realize and  practise. This is indicated in Vivekachudamani as "For a
realized person, reading this book is redundant, For an unrealized
person reading this book is also a waste".

Vedanta, is a logical system, It was formed to indicate the presence
of Brahman, but does not show it. Brahman is beyond logic. And for
practical vedanta, we need not search anywhere , but practise the
Bhagwad Geeta.
This is my opinion.
