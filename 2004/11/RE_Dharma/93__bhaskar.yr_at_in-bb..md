The answer to this question is to be found in Sankaracarya's introduction
to
the gItAbhAshya. There are two kinds of dharma - pravRtti, that of action,
and nivRtti, that of withdrawal from action. Ideally, the sannyAsin
renounces the former and upholds the latter.

HUmble praNAms Sri vidyA prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Prabhuji kindly clarify what is this nivRtti dharma??  is this restricted
to only jnAna prachAra & nityAnuSTAna  or can the follower of nivRtti
dharma engages in social welfare (samAja kalyANa) activities also, like
taking initiation in temple construction work, involving in settling the
issues as regards to communal violences etc.  Recently I've seen one
saNyAsi   came here to inaugurate veg & non-veg hotel !!!  prabhuji, what
dharma shAstra says on all these extra-curricular activities of sanyAsin??
kindly clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
