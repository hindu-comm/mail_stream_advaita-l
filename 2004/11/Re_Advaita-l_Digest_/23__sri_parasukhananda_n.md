     Guidense of guru--venkata sreenivas-message-3
Dear Mahasay,

            Before starting any discussion about the Guru,
we must understand that the word `Guru` does not mean teacherhood
Guru means great. greater than all in the world, including 
the god.  Gods after all
are created by the Guru only for the convenience of Saadhana.

            Everyone, however great he is, should surrender down
before one particular person, and call him as Guru. Ofcourse,
you have to ellicit  the details of that Guru, whether he belongs
to any Parampara of a recognized Sampradaaya, whether he has taken 
Poorna Acharya Deeksha from his guru, and was authorised to initiate
any one for the Vidya, whether he is an ardent follower of his Guru.
"Guru Bhakthi Samaayukthah Puraanagno ViseyShatah"
Whether he has studied at least some of the Puraanaas
Whether he is mentally and physically healthy. After knowing all
details only, one has to approach that Guru for initiation.

            You have nothing to learn from the guru, except receiving the ShakthiPatha,and just hering him only. Guru is the embodiment of the whole GuruParampara right from Naaraayana, Padmabhuva to Sankara-
charya, the ParameyStiGuru, ParamaGuru,and swaguru. Whatever the 
Guru is saying, is not other than Naraayanaa`s preaching. Then only
it becomes fruitful. Leaveaway the doubt about Quacks and cons.

            "Gurureykaha" is the principle. If you have taken initiation from one Guru, and approach another, no body, who knows the 
Sampradaaya will accept him as SiShya,but he can teach anything 
in the name of the first Guru only. It is most essential that periodical visits to the Guru and observe his routine lifeway.
Charanam means AAcharanam. Vidya cannot be taught all at a time.
But it is taught Stage by stage,since it is called Krama Vidya.
The living Guru only can guide you to read the teachings of vertual Gurus,and clear the doubts created. It is my experiance that my 
Guru is clearing all my doubts somehow or other even after his demise.

              Being a samsaari, one should not take deeksha from any 
sanyaasi, because he can teach you only vyraagya only, which one 
should never desire of. A Smsaari Should know about the Purushardhaas
only.  Any doubts on this letter may be reffered to me
  "Just pray for the Guru, he will call you to him or come to you"
