Dear Fellow  Members,

The bright Hindu festival of Deepavali has been tinged with some
sorrow this year owing to the arrest of a revered Peetadipathi, HH
Sri Jayendra Saraswathi of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. While the charges framed against him are best left to the courts of law, the manner in which he has been arrested on basis of some evidence does give rise to some heartburn. I condemn the manner of arrest. Please join me in praying for a speedy and just trial in which the honour of Hindu traditions would get upheld. I am also forwarding an email that I received from Kanchi Peetam with links to prayers for the wellbeing of the Swamiji for those who may be interested.

Vivek Natarajan

If 9/11 terrorist activity on USA soil made all the Americans across USA to join together and fight for terrorism, 11/11 humiliation to H.H. Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Swamiji in the Holy Grounds of India on a Guruvaram and that too on the Holiest day of the year for HINDUS -  "DEEPAVALI", has made all  the INDIANS across the world with different faiths and beliefs to join together and pray for H.H.Sri Perivaa.  It is no exaggeration to say that there would not be one single recipient of this email, who would not have got atleast one single phone call or an email from anybody across the world, including from any unknown person/(s) about the recent incident.  With the Blessings of H.H. Sri Bala Perivaa, we were able to get the special Sloka especially made by two scholars for H.H. Sri Perivaa (with His Birth Star and Rasi).  While all of us are deeply hurt with the incident, we can take part in a very simple way by doing one or all of the following:

In addition to reciting the attached special sloka (at present this has been transliterated only in English and Tamil but transliteration to Telugu and Kannada have been undertaken by some devotees and will be available shortly), the following links are given for your easy navigation and to add more strength to our Prayers and efforts.

A group of devotees have put up the following site for online petition and you may want to join the thousands of devotees who have already signed on this petition.

There would be tens of thousands devotees who would not be getting this email and please feel free to either forward the email or atleast the links and the attachment so that they can also take part in the same.

Devotees across USA have been coordinating for various activities like Chandi Homam and Durga Puja in various cities.  Please get in touch with your area contacts or visit http://www.kksfusa.org  for further details on this and for more activities.


Hara Hara Sankara!  Jaya Jaya Sankara!
