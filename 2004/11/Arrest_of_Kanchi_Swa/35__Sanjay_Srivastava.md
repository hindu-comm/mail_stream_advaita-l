I respect Sri Vivekshankar's sentiments however I think that unless 
government had some really-real solid evidence against the seer, it would 
not have dared to act in such an arrogant manner.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Arrest of Kanchi Swamiji
Date: Mon, 15 Nov 2004 12:16:30 -0800 (PST)

Dear Fellow  Members,

The bright Hindu festival of Deepavali has been tinged with some
sorrow this year owing to the arrest of a revered Peetadipathi, HH
Sri Jayendra Saraswathi of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. While the charges framed 
against him are best left to the courts of law, the manner in which he has 
been arrested on basis of some evidence does give rise to some heartburn. I 
condemn the manner of arrest. Please join me in praying for a speedy and 
just trial in which the honour of Hindu traditions would get upheld. I am 
also forwarding an email that I received from Kanchi Peetam with links to 
prayers for the wellbeing of the Swamiji for those who may be interested.

Vivek Natarajan

If 9/11 terrorist activity on USA soil made all the Americans across USA to 
join together and fight for terrorism, 11/11 humiliation to H.H. Sri 
Jayendra Saraswathi Swamiji in the Holy Grounds of India on a Guruvaram and 
that too on the Holiest day of the year for HINDUS -  "DEEPAVALI", 
has made all  the INDIANS across the world with different faiths and beliefs 
to join together and pray for H.H.Sri Perivaa.  It is no exaggeration to say 
that there would not be one single recipient of this email, who would not 
have got atleast one single phone call or an email from anybody across the 
world, including from any unknown person/(s) about the recent incident.  
With the Blessings of H.H. Sri Bala Perivaa, we were able to get the special 
Sloka especially made by two scholars for H.H. Sri Perivaa (with His Birth 
Star and Rasi).  While all of us are deeply hurt with the incident, we can 
take part in a very simple way by doing one or all of the following:

In addition to reciting the attached special sloka (at present this has been 
transliterated only in English and Tamil but transliteration to Telugu and 
Kannada have been undertaken by some devotees and will be available 
shortly), the following links are given for your easy navigation and to add 
more strength to our Prayers and efforts.

http://www.kamakoti.org/misc/prayer-tamil-1.html

http://guru-charitra.shreeswami.org/sri-guru-charitra-chapter-14.htm

A group of devotees have put up the following site for online petition and 
you may want to join the thousands of devotees who have already signed on 
this petition.

http://www.petitiononline.com/dharma1/

There would be tens of thousands devotees who would not be getting this 
email and please feel free to either forward the email or atleast the links 
and the attachment so that they can also take part in the same.

Devotees across USA have been coordinating for various activities like 
Chandi Homam and Durga Puja in various cities.  Please get in touch with 
your area contacts or visit http://www.kksfusa.org  for further details on 
this and for more activities.


Hara Hara Sankara!  Jaya Jaya Sankara!
