When a child is in suffering, it goes to the parents for solace. When adults 
like us are in pain, God/Guru is the sole refuge. At this point when our 
faiths are shaken, when our own existence in life is not very clear, we 
should hope for a better tomorrow.

I wanted to share with many devotees seeking solace at this time a message 
from Sri Ganapathi Sachchidananda Swamiji of Mysore.

Sri Swamiji comments on Sri Shankaracharya's arrest

Sri Swamiji has announced the following message:

THE SHANKARACHARYA OF KANCHI KAMAKOTI MATTHAM, HIS HOLINESS SRI JAYENDRA 
SARASWATI SWAMIJI IS A VIBRANT SPIRITUAL PERSONALITY. HE HAS INSPIRED NOT 
ONLY HINDUS, HERE IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT ALL OTHER CREEDS WITH AN ATTRIBUTE OF 
EQUANIMITY.
WE HAVE A DEEP AFFINITY OF THE SPIRIT AND SIMILARITY IN OUR FUNCTIONING.
THE RECENT HAPPENINGS HAVE SHOCKINGLY DISTRESSED US AND LEFT A DEEP SCAR IN 
THE INTEGRATED INDIAN PSYCHE.
WE SHOULD JOIN TOGETHER AND OFFER OUR DEEP ROOTED FEELINGS TO THE 
SHANKARACHARYA AND NORMALCY SHOULD RETURN SOON BY THE GRACE OF LORD 
DATTATREYA. THE MORAL AND POLITICAL EQUATION SHOULD BE RESTORED WITH A 
PERMANENT INTEGRATED VISION THAT THE WHOLE HUMANITY IS ONE AND TO UNDERSTAND 
THAT GOD-DIRECTED FORCE RULES THIS WORLD.

Jaya Guru Datta

Secretary to Sri Swamiji
