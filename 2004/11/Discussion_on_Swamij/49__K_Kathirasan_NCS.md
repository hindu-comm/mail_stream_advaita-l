Hari Om,

Namaste.

World is my creation and the happenings of this world - moral or immoral,
are once again the creation of my mind. If in such a world of mine, I am
seeing such sad happening as Sri Shankaracharya's arrest, it is nothing but
the creation of my sinful mind. I need to expend my past sin by undergoing
such humiliatory experience of being a witness to such happenings in my
mind's world. And I gain solace by sharing it with my friends on this forum,
which again is my creation :)) Do I need to get unduly perturbed by a
nightmare I see as a dream? No need to. I just need to relax, be a mute
witness to all the drama. Silence can heal all wounds. Talking can only make
it worse.

Hari om.
