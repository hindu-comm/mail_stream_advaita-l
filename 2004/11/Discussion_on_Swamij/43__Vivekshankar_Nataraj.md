Dear Fellow Advaithins,
I certainly did not intend to start a discussion or a thread on the topic of Swamiji's arrest. As I said in the beginning, the merits of the case are best left to courts. However I believe that this is a forum for Asthika Advaithins and therefore I sent an appeal to join the prayers for the wellbeing of the sampradaya that the swami does represent. Hope this clarifies.

Vivek
