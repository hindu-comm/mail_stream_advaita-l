Hari Om Tat Sat,

I do not wish to add any fuel to this already smouldering controversy 
with the Kanchi Swamiji. On the outset, I wish to add that I have a long 
history of the Kanchi mutt in my family but I was not brought up in the 
same tradition. I wish to just add my views on this and hope that they 
shall be taken in the right perspective.

All Sadhakas, please understand that a controversy like this does not 
imply that Sri Adi Sankara's tradition has been blemished. He was Truth 
itself and a great soul. I personally find no reason to feel that this 
whole matter needs to burden the balanced believer. The traditions, 
philosophy and thoughts that Sri Adi Sankara put forth based on his 
realization are extremely lofty - one cannot understand or even grasp 
the full meaning of them to feel that the whole tradition has been 
tainted or lost.

We live in an age wherein being and living like a sanyasi needs 
herculean efforts.Parameters like money,power,physical gratification 
have always been around in the material sense but this is an unusually 
different time and age because these so-called ideals dominate much more 
than before. For those who knew the present Acharya personally, it must 
be a difficult time to believe the authenticity of the claims. For those 
who do not know him also, there must be a certain bitter feeling about 
the whole business.

Great saints have gone at lengths to explain that the material aspects 
of the world around us(Maya if I may call it) sway even the most 
steadfast of souls. In such a scenario, it is best to refrain from 
taking sides. I do not wish to suggest any wrongdoings on the part of 
these great souls - but the law has to be allowed to take its course. I 
believe the moderator wishes to quell any heated discussions that may 
arise out of this topic.

I would like to reiterate that Truth(Brahman) in itself is absolute. It 
does not need defendants or protestors to shout about its absoluteness 
from rooftops. Truth needs to be practiced and realized. We are all 
limited souls in that sense that we still seek to realize our true 
nature. It might give us solace for the time being to discuss this issue 
and make ourselves believe in the innocence of someone who is the keeper 
of a great tradition. It is best to look within oneself and realize that 
no matter what outcome this controversy brings, the true nature of 
ourselves shall never change.

Tat Tvam Asi,

Navin

Including the moderator of this forum, there have been several others who have mentioned to just end this topic without further discussion, implying that one should leave it at that.

I do not see how it becomes a burden if few members happen to even mention about the incidence, in a very proper manner, before which even the moderator steps in asking for closure of the topic.

Even amidst serious topics, exceptional or interesting subjects do find a way in other forums which gives a break and makes it worthwhile.  But I must admit this particular group (advaita-l) is different in which even the regular postings refrain from addressing the mails to anyone in particular, more of one liners being dashed of as if replied in a hurry, does not carry the customary "regards" or some other closing salutation (which I believe is a basic respect that one can show to fellow human beings) before signing off!  Postings here seem more like accidentally coming across "intellectual exchanges" (devoid of any courtesies) between two "atmas" rather than two individuals!

However I believe that this is a forum for Asthika Advaithins and therefore I sent an appeal to join the prayers for the wellbeing of the sampradaya that the swami does represent. Hope this clarifies.
