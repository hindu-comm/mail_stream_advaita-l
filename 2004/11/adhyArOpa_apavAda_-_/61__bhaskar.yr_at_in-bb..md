Hare Krishna

Thanks for the kind words.

Further to subject mail, Sri Jaldhar prabhuji & Sri Sunder Hattangadi
prabhuji have kindly provided the references from paiNgaLOpanishat for
adhyArOpa apavAda. Here it is for the ready reference for the members :

(a)  Sri Sunder Prabhuji's reference:

             Paingala upan. 2:10   -

adhyaaropaapavaadataH svaruupa.n nishchayiikartu.n
shakyate .
tasmaatsadaa vichaarayejjagajjiivaparamaatmano

[A dialogue between Yajnavalkya and Paingala.]

(b)  Sri Jaldhar Vyas prabhuji's reference :

I assume you mean paiNgalopaniShad?  It is II.12.

(apologies for transcription errors, I don't have much time.)

Then taking refuge in the Guru and serving him for a long time, he should
request to know what is bondage and liberation.  Bondage caused by lack of
enquiry becomes liberation by enquiry.  So one should always enquire. It
is possible to determine the true form [of the self] through
superimposition and negation.  So one should always enquire into [the
nature of] the world, jiva and and paramatma, by negating the jiva and the
world only the most subtle [self] which is not different from Brahman
remains.
