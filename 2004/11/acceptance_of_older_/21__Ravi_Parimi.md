Hi,

 I have always wanted to know if it is possible for men older than 20
years to enrol themselves in a gurukulam and learn the vedas? From my
experience and observation, most vedic pundits (and priests alike)
start their education at a very early age (8-12). Does anyone know if
it is against a gurukulam's policy to admit students beyond a certain
age limit?

For a regular guy who gets college education, is employed and gains an
interest in the vedas at a later stage in his life, what avenues are
available in India to learn the vedas?

Thanks,
--ravi
