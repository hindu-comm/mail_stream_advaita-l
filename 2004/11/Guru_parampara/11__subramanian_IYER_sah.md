Namaskaram,

I went to kamakoti Mutt and I saw the Guru paramapara, and it starts
from Mahavishnu. Is Mahavishnu the first Guru for Advaitha Sampradaya.
Now in Advaitic concept do we see mahavishnu as a GOD "REAL" or
Unreal. I mean how come in "aham Brahmasmi" concept we can have
Mahavishnu as our GURU.

Thanks
Subu
