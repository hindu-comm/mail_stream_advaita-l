In the traditional Advaita texts, it is used only in the second sense. The 
rope-snake discussion is used as an analogy. Just as an erroneous judgment 
sees a snake where there is nothing but a rope, an erroneous judgment 
ascribes reality to duality where there is nothing but non-duality.

The first sense is wrong, in and of itself. Duality is never one of rope vs. 
snake, but one of rope vs. not-rope and snake vs. not-snake. In the case of 
the rope-snake, the erroneous cognition is of the form, "this is a snake" 
and the correct cognition is of the form, "oh, this is a rope". Of course, 
there is, ultimately, no duality and therefore, no external object that is 
either a rope or a snake. However, this knowledge comes from a different 
source, i.e. SAstra, not from the rope-snake discussion itself.
