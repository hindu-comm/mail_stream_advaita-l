Sri Satish,

>By the way, how does one ascertain that the Guru he approached has directly 
>experienced >Brahman?

It can be ascertained when the Guru answers the shishya's questions to 
shishya's satisfaction. Brahman being something big; suffice if Guru knows 
something bigger than what the shishya knows. Real test is when shishya 
progressively asks tougher questions.

Best regards
Bhadraiah
