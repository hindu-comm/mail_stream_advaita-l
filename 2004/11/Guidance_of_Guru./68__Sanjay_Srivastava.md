He can inspire-- agreed. But how can teaching be transferred in this way?

I beg to differ. In advaita, "VedAnt vijnAn suniScitarthaih" shabdas are the 
language of truth. Silence has been glorified in Zen and Tao traditions-- 
not here. If we mix up the two, we would not be doing justice to either.

No one denies that there could be "brahmanishtham" saints without being 
"shrotriyam". The question here is whether such mahaatmas could be effective 
teachers also? My experience is that such saints might be useful for some 
exceptionally prepared students but for an ordinary seeker it is best not to 
rely on exceptions.
