Dear Sri Sanjay Srivastava,

Not that I know Brahman, but you really asked an advanced question :-)

Sri Sankara states that a question is more powerful than an answer, not 
without a reason. Being able to perceive a question is a skill. The 
questioner will not be satisfied until the answer resolves the original 
doubt. A verbally satisfying answer is still susceptible to further 
questions. E.g., any disucssion re: karma theory.

>Arguably, student is not advanced to that stage where he can judge himself

The student's aham may not be, but the student's prana is. So an answer that 
appeals to the prana has to be necessarily satisfying and hence correct.

Isn't 'not having peers' a qualification for a knower of Brahman? :-)

Even students of many a new age teacher can figure out after some practice 
if the teacher is faking, if they really try.

Best regards
Bhadraiah
