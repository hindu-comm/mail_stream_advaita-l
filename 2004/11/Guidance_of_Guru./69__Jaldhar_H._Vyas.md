Thankyou.  you have certainly given food for thought and I definately want
to take a closer look at those Gita shlokas you mentioned.  However it
should be noted that atleast according to mundakopanishadbhashya it seems
Shankaracharya takes brahmanishta to be equal to sannyasi.  A sannyasi can
be either a vividisha (seeker) or vidvan (knower) of Brahman.  The idea of
the Guru being brahmanishta seems to be (atleast this is the impression I
get) such a one will not be distracted by worldly needs and concerns not
necessarily that he will be able to convey some special information a mere
mortal cannot.  Experience is intensely personal and not easily passed on.
But unlike the animals, through the divine faculty of speech, Man has the
ability to learn and comprehend.  This is why Vagdevi has always held the
highest place of honour in our civilization and why comprehension of
words of Vedanta is the key to moksha.
