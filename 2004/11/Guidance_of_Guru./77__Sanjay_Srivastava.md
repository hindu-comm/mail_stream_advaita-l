>>Real test is when shishya progressively asks tougher questions.

It is similar to trying to figure out if someone claiming to be an expert in 
some advanced field of knowledge is really an expert. Asking questions and 
getting satisfactory answers is a positive indicator. However if the 
question was really advanced, how would the student know whether the answer 
was correct? Arguably, student is not advanced to that stage where he can 
judge himself whether the answer was correct or not. I would say, the 
person's reputation among his peers would be a much more reliable indicator 
than student's own judgment.

One of the problems with non-sampradAyavid teachers is that they do not have 
peers and therefore it is left to the subjective judgment of the shishya to 
decide if the teacher is brahmanishtham or not.

Best regards
Bhadraiah
