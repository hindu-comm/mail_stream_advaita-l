Yes! This cannot be stressed enough.  Whereas Purvamimamsa deals with the
karmakanda of the shastras, Vedanta is the Uttaramimamsa.  The subject is
different but the method, textual exegesis, is the same.  The very first
Brahmasutra declares that what is to commence is an enquiry (jignasa) into
the nature of Brahman.  The dhatu jna -- to know does not differentiate
between intellectual knowledge or mystical or any other kind.
