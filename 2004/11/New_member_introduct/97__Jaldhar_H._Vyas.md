Namasthe,

I am a Phd student at Pennsylvania state university. My interests in
joining this egroup has arised due to my association (by birth) with
the kanchi kamakoti peetam. I have been wanting to learn more about
sri shankara's philosphy and hence was searching for an appropriate
forum. My contribution to the forum will be more as questions rahter
than any postings as i have very limited (Read No!) knowlege acquired
so far.

This way I feel I will be able to defend shankara's philosphy when
encountered with questions from devotees of other philosophies like
dvaita, vishitadvaita and achintya bedha abedha. Hoping to join this
egroup and get to learn more...

sincerely,
Rajaraman R
