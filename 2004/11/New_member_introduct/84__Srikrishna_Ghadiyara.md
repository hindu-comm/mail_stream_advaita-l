hariH Om !!

Srinivas:

If you live in the bay area you may benefit by
attending Chinmaya Mission programs or Arsha Vidya
Programs conducted in the bay area. Recently, we
started reading Bhagavad Gita with Telugu commentary.
If it helps you, please get in touch with me.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
