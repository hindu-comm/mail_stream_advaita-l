Namaste

I am a resident of Hyderabad working in a s/ware firm; I am also the
member of a forum called Indian Civilization run by Dr.Kalyanaraman; I had
come across reference to your site in one of hte posts by a member Sri
P.N.Kumar;

I am from a Smartha family and have interest in Advaita; I am no scholar
in the subject and would like to benefit from the knowledge of the other
list members of this group;
