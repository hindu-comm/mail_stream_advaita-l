Hi

Firstly, thank you very much for your response. Thanks for making me 
aware that I was actually not differentiating between Karma and Gyana.
You did mention that you were looking for information on Practical 
Advaita, was wondering if you got any kind of material, that closely 
defines it if not a complete book atleast an excerpt.
I am sorry, from next time I shall surely write all information about a 
quote that I use.

You wrote
'The path of GYAna is for sannyAsins'.

Does it means only SannyAsins can achieve moksha? Correct me if I am 
wrong. I always though that Sankara preached that only Gyana yogi can 
achieve moksha or get liberated from the cycle of rebirth.

Best Wishes,
Girish
