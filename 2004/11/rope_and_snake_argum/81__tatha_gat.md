Hello,

I would like to know how the rope and snake argument
is used in kevala advaita. I have heard it being used
in two ways -

1) That you think of "it" in terms of rope/snake
because you are still conditioned and you are still
trying to think in terms of concepts and dualities. In
reality, it is neither a rope nor a snake.

2) When you see a rope and think of a snake, you are
superimposing the concept of a snake on top of the
reality (rope). Likewise, we superimpose dualistic
concepts on top of non dual reality.

Thanks.
Mayuresh.
