Namaskaram

I respect and appreciate Mr Sarma confidence in our judisiory and in
our democracy system. Please also have a kind look at our people
stitting in parliments, how many charge sheets they have, how many
ministers have been chargesheeted for murder, but they are still our
ministers ruling us. what are those learned judges doing. After all
they also need a win their bread.

Law is common to all, so Jayendrar should also be treated with the
same law applicable to every body. My humble opinion is he should not
be treated like a convict, but only as a accused and all rights to
defend him should be givento him.

(sorry for not using my subscribed mail id as my mail server is down,
I thought I should pro-act to the cause)

Thanks, 
Subramanian sahasranamam IYER.
