Dear  Saadhakas ,

Ever  since  the  temple  entry  stir   , all  maths  and  temples  allow  all  hindus  inside  their  premises  to  pray . That  an  exclusive  temperament  of  the  Braahmins  is  responsible  for  this  event  is  total  non-sense .Even  Shri  Jayendra  Sarasvati  Svaamiji  has  been  quite  revolutionary  and  unorthodox  in  that  respect .

The  reason  for  His  arrest  is  simple :  one-upmanship  between  the  AIADMK  and  DMK  parties , and  the  vast  resources  at  the  Math's  disposal .

In  this  time  of  crisis  , not  only  all  sections  of  Hindus  , but  also  all  believers  in  God  must  pray  for  Shri  Svaamiji's  release .

The  issue  in  some  people's  minds  is  that  the  Kaamakoti  Peetha  is  not  one  of  the  Chaturaamnayas , hence  much  importance  needn't  be  given  here .But  that  should  not  be  an  issue  at  all . 
Dharma  itself  is  in  danger .

Personally , I  believe  that  the  Divine  Mother  , Bhagavati Kaamaakshi  will  see  to  it  that  justice  is  served .

JAYA JAYA SHANKARA HARA  HARA  SHANKARA.

With  Love , 
Rohit  N. Ubhayaker.

I totally agree with your assessment. Is the Kanchi Mutt meant for
Brahmins? Is it not for propogating the Hindu Religion? Is the Hindu
Religion the exclusive preserve of the Brahmins? This exclusivist
attitude of Brahmins is what isolates them.
