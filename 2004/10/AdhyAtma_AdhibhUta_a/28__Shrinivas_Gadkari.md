Namaste,

Among the six technical terms defined in Gita Ch 8,
are: Adhi-Atma, Adhi-bhUta, Adhi-daiva.

These three also form fundamental concepts in sAmkhya.
I was wondering if the list members could point to
sAmkhya texts or upaniShad texts, or any other text
that explains these terms.

Any other information in form of personal comments,
explanations are welcome.

Regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari
