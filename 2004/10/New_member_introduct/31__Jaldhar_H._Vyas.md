Namaskar,

I am a graduate student at the Penn State University, University Park. I
am interested in understanding the views of different schools of vedanta.
I hope to gain understanding of advaita vedanta throught this e-group. I
would also request if you can recommend me some good books on advaita
vedanta.

Regards,

Vidyadhar Karmarkar
