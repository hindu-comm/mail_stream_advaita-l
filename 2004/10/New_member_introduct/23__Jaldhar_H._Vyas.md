I am Murali Manohar. I live in Portland, OR. I have had an interest in
Vedanta from early on. I owe a lot of my early motivaion to association with
people from the Ramanshram and the RK mutt. Over time this interest has
taken me to several interesting terrains, JK, spinoza, the 'Sophia perrinis'
folks (Ananda Coomaraswamy, Rene Guenon, Frtihjof Schuon etc), early
christianity etc. At some point in time, this was perhaps to feel
'intellectual'; made me 'feel good' about myself - hopefully more humility
has set in now.

I cannot honestly say that I fully comprehend the distinctions between
advaita and vishishtadvaitha to exclusivly subscribe to one or the other,
nor can I claim to be smart enough to identify where they differ in an
articulate enough manner to solicit guidence. Given these handicaps, I am
generally silent about this, least people discover my ignorance. Remember? I
need to feel 'intellectual' ;)

Pranams,
Murali
