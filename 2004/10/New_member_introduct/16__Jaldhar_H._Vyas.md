57year old, male.  Vietnam vet.  18yr clean/sober via 12 steps.  Past
experience (only 3 yrs) with Vedanta in St. Petersburg, Florida, began
1975. Recent, more prolonged term due to the Lord as expressed in Vedantic
texts. My recovery seems based on need to expand my spiritual life.  Am
verbose , but have time to keep mouth closed and read.


Om Shanti
