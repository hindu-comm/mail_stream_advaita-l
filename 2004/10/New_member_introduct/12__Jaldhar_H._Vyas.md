Sir, with Navaratri coming up I hope your participation in this list will
not be merely passive and you will give us the the benefit of your
experience.  Strictly speaking the philosophy of the upanishads
is for the sannyasis only.  This is why Shankaracharya has recommended
Shrividya as a discipline that prepares grhasthas like the majority of
this lists' readers for the knowledge of Brahman.
