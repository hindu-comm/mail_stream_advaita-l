Please visit http://www.himalayanacademy.com and click on publications to 
find some books on this.  This is one of the Saiva monastries founded in 
Hawaii by a western Swami, who took to renunciation in Jaffna from a 
well-known yogi.

Though this has been written by a westerner, I believe that it is rooted in 
traditional Saivism as practised in the Tamil land.

I hope this helps.

Thanks,
Ravi
