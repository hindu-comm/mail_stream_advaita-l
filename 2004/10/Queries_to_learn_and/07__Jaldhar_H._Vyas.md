Every logical system ends up having to resort to axioms i.e. statements
not provable withing the system itself.  That there is jnana is something
we learn from the shastras (shabda - the 3rd pramana) not through
pratyaksha or anumana.

As you mentioned we don't understand porcupine-loka.  so it is irrelevant
whether we attempt to use its definitions or not.  We do however
understand manushya-loka.  So we use its' definition of jnana.  Like the
value of pi, it may not be perfect but it is the best we have available.

Note that sitting there is exactly what Krshna Bhagavan did!  He was the
charioteer and the actual task of destroying evil was done by Arjuna who
far from being a jnani actually managed to forget the teaching of the
Gita.

The point is even in action there are direct and indirect types.

Or better yet we can forget about needing anyone and do the job ourselves.
The Vedic path is twofold-pravrtti and nivrtti.  It is the duty of
grhasthas to maintain society.  Nowadays it is fashionable for swamis to
get involved in politics or social work etc. but they are not doing
themselves or anyone else any favor by muddling up the duties of the
ashramas in this way.

Jnana is impractical, pointless, vegetable like if you will.  If one is
the type who sees "enemies" then it is better to follow the path the Vedas
have ordained for such people then to pretend one is a jnani.  For a jnani
can have no enemies.  It should be noted that Krishna Bhagavan offered
both the Pandavas and Kauravas the chance to have Him on their side.  If
He fought Duryodhana, it is because the latter rejected Him (due to his
avaricious and ignorant nature) not the other way around.

And you can work day in and day out destroy the enemy without being a jnani.
