Sure.

Why? Don't you see vairAgya, chEtana, vivEka etc? Do you need any
shAstras for that?

If you don't understand porcupine-loka, it is not correct to make
comments about their jnAna or ajnAna.

If He was just sitting there (He was a sthitaprajna, sure, but not a
sthitahasta!), would He say

yadi hyahaM na vartEyam jAtu karmaNyataMdritaH |
mama vartmAnuvartaMtE manuShyAH pArtha sarvashaH ||

utsIdEyurimE lOkAh na kuryAm karma chEdaham |

The difference I'm trying to bring about is between sitting in a cave
and meditating and going out there in the battlefield. Being a
charioteer is equivalent to fighting. Directing Arjuna to the correct
place to aim arrows is fightiing. It's not sitting in a cave and
meditating. It's not being a vegetable, blind to the rise of adharma.

Exactly. And be jnAnis too.

Sure, for the jnAni there is no enemy! For Him there is no adharma,
but He fights adharma. Do you think Krishna would have allowed the
Kauravas to win if Duryodhana had taken Krishna on his side?! If
Krishna had let the Kauravas win, He would have earned the blame of
the entire world. Of course it's no big deal to Him if He has to bathe
in a sea of saliva, but why would He? Why would He at all?

The enemy is brahman, but it has to be killed. Adharma is brahman, but
it has to be eliminated.

> And you can work day in and day out destroy the enemy without being a jnani.

Sure, but you can be both. We need to be both. That's the call of the
hour. Telling ourselves all the time that you can either kill the
enemy or be a jnAni (but not both) is being foolish.

Cheers
Kiran
