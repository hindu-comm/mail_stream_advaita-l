Why should one need to make measurements to come to a conclusion?  Anumana
is just as much a pramana as pratyaksha.  By the lack of qualities such as
chetana, viveka, vairagya and other necessary prerequisites to jnana we
can conclude that they cannot realize.  Now I can't guarantee that there
has been no animal jnani ever nor ever will be just as I can't actually
guarantee the world will not end tomorrow.

Yes thats true.  When we get to the level of actual jnanis it becomes very
difficult to predict how they are going to behave.  (And that's not even
counting e.g. the avadhutas who deliberately behave in apparently crazy
ways.)

So perhaps it is more fruitful to think about how an ajnani behaves and
try and avoid those type of things.  By process of elimination, only jnana
will remain.

Again, that's the wrong way to look at it.  Take pi for instance.  We can
never "measure" it as it is a an infinitely long irrational number.  That
doesn't stop it from being useful in all sorts of calculations does it?

But now you are making the same mistake you admonished me for.  There is
no one set way a jnani behaves.  Some may behave as Krishna, but some may
not.  For instance Rshi Valmiki was so still and inert an anthill grew up
around him.

But I do believe that in all cases, the only motivation for the behavior
will be the experience of Brahman not any external factors.
