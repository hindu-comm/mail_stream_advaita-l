How do you know that "they can never realize it"? What measurements
did you make on them before you came to this conclusion?

You cannot judge a brahmaj~JAni from his actions, for he is the vidvAn
following this shloka:

saktAH karmaNyavidvAMsO yathA kurvaMti bhArata |
kuryAdvidvAMstathAsaktaSchikIrShurlOkasaMgraham ||

We humans may just not be having the measuring instrument to measure
the brahmaj~JAna of a horse, a porcupine, or a snail.

Sure, but that does not mean he'll be sitting in a cave like a dead
man or a vegetable thinking of nothing or something "beyond". Even
"nothing" and "beyond" are meaningless to him. He can be doing karma
like you and I. Indeed, among workers, He is the shrEShTha. Among
warriors on the battlefield, He is Krishna!

A better answer to the question as to what are the qualities and
behaviour of one who has realized brahman are, is: He shall have the
qualities of Krishna, He shall behave like Krishna!

Cheers
Kiran
