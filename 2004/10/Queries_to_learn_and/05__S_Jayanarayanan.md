I did not refer to your old posting to point out that you had changed
your mind. We all change our opinions, and it makes no difference to a
current discussion if you had a different opinion on the matter a few
years ago. 

My point was that you had previously given examples from *scripture* to
show that animals can be self-realized:

1) kAka bhushuNDi in the rAmAyaNa and Yoga VaasishhTha.
2) Gajendra of the BhAgavatam.

And we even have corroboration of a person respected by the tradition:

3) Ramana maharshi has said that animals can be self-realized (I think
this is in the context of the samAdhi of cow Lakshmi in the
Ramanasramam).

If would be a good idea to look at the quotes from the above
references.
