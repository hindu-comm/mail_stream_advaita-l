First you define something called jnAna, second you have no instrument
to measure this in a porcupine, and then you claim the poor porcupine
is an ajnAni! Wonderful reasoning!

jnAna and ajnAna are measurables in manuShyalOka. We have no way of
ascertaining there aren't parallels in porcupine-lOka which we haven't
yet been able to measure.

Your example of pi: Pi is a measurable. Only, we aren't 100% accurate,
that's all. It's different with the jnAna of a porcupine: you haven't
even identified a measurable. You're measuring a porcupine with the
yardstick of homo-sapiens. Bad experiment.

It's my bias for Krishna. We need men who can fight and destroy the
enemy. Not sit and vegetate when the enemy is cheating us, killing us,
destroying our Nation, destroying our culture, destroying our
languages, destroying our economy, stealing our youth, doing every act
of adharma in the book and outside it.

We need men who, even while they fight the enemy, have anthills grown
around them - just as Valmiki, but on the battlefield and always alert
- not vegetables.

We don't need another Valmiki who can write another Ramayana as much
as we need another Rama who can fight the enemy.

All I'm trying to say is - you can still be a jnAni if your only
business is not meditation, so be Rama who works day in and day out to
destroy the enemy, not Valmiki.

With this, I agree.

Cheers
