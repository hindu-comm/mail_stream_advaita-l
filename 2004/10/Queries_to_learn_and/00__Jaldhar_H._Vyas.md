We can say at the very beginning most beings are just animals. i.e.  it
can react to stimulus and do what it needs to in order to survive and
that's it.  While such beings are as much Brahman as the wisest sage they
can never realize it because they lack self-awareness.

The sense that there is an "other" and there are limits to selfhood.
While such beings are also as much Brahman as the wisest sage they can
never realize it because their attachment to false notions renders them
unable to see Brahman for what it truly is.

The knowledge that both the non-apprehension of selfhood and the limited
idea of selfhood are based on misconceptions and the self is really one,
continuous, and infinite.

He is utterly indifferent towards the world of multiplicity not because he
hates it or looks down on it but it is totally meaningless for him.
