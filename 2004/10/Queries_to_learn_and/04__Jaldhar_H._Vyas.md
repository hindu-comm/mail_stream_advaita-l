So perhaps I should not have so emphatically stated that they cannot.  But
even in the earlier message I said the deciding factor is self-awareness.
A creature which does not have the idea of selfhood even in the limited

In the message from 2000, I mentioned this subject has been discussed in
the brahmasutras.  I shall try and find that section again and post it.
