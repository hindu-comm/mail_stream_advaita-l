Krishna, I presume you are a member of adviataL list and not advaitin
list.  I am posting your mail assuming the moderators of both lists do
not object. Restrictions were imposed by the moderators of both lists to
make sure that the discussions are centered on the advaita rather than
getting sidetracked to other mata-s.  Some of these aspects related to
suShupti were discussed recently by Shree Ananda Wood from the point of
Shree Atmaanandaji analysis. Those files can be obtained from archives
of the advaitin list, if you are a member. 

If anyone wants to respond to Shree Krishna's request, one can do so
directly to his address or at least include  his address for him to
receive the response. 

Hari OM!
Sadananda
