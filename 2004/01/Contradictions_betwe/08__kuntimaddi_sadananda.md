Thanks Kartik for focussing on the issues raised by SSS.  Yes I read
those pages of the Book ' The method of the Vedanta'.  

Frankly, I find some of the differences that SSS finds between Shankara
and his disciples are rather very subtle and some times involve much ado
about little things.  I have not studied the text completely and I was
hoping you will be able to focus each one to discuss. I fully agree with
SSS statement that in the final analysis one must resort to the verdict
of Vedas and reasoning. Let us take the two examples you have provided. 
The Upanishad statement as presented states in parallel construction:

1. The human world is to be won .....by begetting a son, and not .....
2. The world of ancestors is to be won... ..       (the subordinate
clause involving an exclusion statement is missing)
3. And the world of gods is to be won .............(again the
subordinate clause for exclusion is missing) 

Shankara adds missing exclusion based on the parallel constuction.
Sureshvara is right in the objecting exclusive statement if if is either
obvious that the exclusion is not correct. If Sureswara had provided
sufficient evidence from Veda that exclusive statement is unnecessory
restrictive then he is right.  'We know from Vedas .. ' does not say
much about the conflicting evidence. Unfortunately SSS, at least in
those pages did not provide the evidence from Vedas that Shree Sureswara
provides that other means are also available to justify his stand.  Here
the issue is important for whatever it is worth since exclusion of other
means if they are available will provide unwarrented restrictions.

Let us take the second example:

Here I find little bit of much ado.  Ignorance is the cause and the
naama ruupa is the effect - as non-apprehension causes misapprehension. 
But effects are not different from cause - they can be considered as
cause itself in different form - as some times pramaaNa, means of
knowledge, is used even to indicate that to be known  by the means of
knowledge, although Shankara is more exact.

my 2C.

These are just comments out of interest - please continue.  

Hari OM!
Sadananda
