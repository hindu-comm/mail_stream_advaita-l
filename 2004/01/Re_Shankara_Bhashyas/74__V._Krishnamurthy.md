i am not sure whether you can read and understand tamil. 
If yes, just go to buy Bhagavad Gita
Bhashya translated into Tamil by Sri Sundaraja Sharma.  He
is a one who has learned traditionally
and has translated it well.  Even H.H. Sri Sringeri
Jagadguru sri Sachidananda Shivabhinvava
Nrusimha Bharathy Maha Swamigal has appreciated it.  So as
the Kanchi Paramacharya.  i think
that would be enough of authenticity. 

i have personally read the work to some extent.  it is fine
and reliable.

Namaste
I have also read the above book by Sunderaraja Sharma. It
is excellent. It is a close translation of Shankara's
commentary, with explanatory notes off and on by the
author. It is authentic. I  recommend the book to any one
who knows Tamil and is interested in getting into Shankara
Bhashya of the Gita.
I do not have the book right now in my possession here in
the U.S.
