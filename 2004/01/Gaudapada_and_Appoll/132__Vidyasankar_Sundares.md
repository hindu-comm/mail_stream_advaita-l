The following message is from Andre Alonso, a Brazilian scholar who is 
interested in Greek texts. I am forwarding it to the list at his request, in 
case someone on the list has something interesting to note.

I've been researching the (real) historical sources for Apollonius of Tyana 
and came across a reference to Gaudapada's Agamasastra in livius.org: 
apparently, the indian philosopher mentioned four personages in the text, 
called "Apalyuna", "Damia", "Vardan" and "Phraotes". All of these seem to be 
transformations of names mentioned in Philostratus' "Life of Apollonius". 
Now, the difficulty is, I've found what purports to be an online text of 
Gaudapada=B4s work, and there is no mention of these names. I've even 
searched a transliteration of the sanskrit text in a german link (which 
appears to be very reliable) but haven't found the slightest trace of them. 
So, knowing that you have studied the very text, I'd like to ask you: 1) 
Does the text contain any mention to names like these? 2) Could you 
recommend a reliable recent edition of this text? I thank you beforehand.

Once more, congratulations on your work.

Best regards,
Andre Alonso
