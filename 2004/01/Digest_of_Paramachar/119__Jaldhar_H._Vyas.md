There are Buddhist, Jain and even Muslim tantras.  Amongst the "Hindu"
tantras there are many which teach things contrary to Vedic morality
(which is why to the man in the street, tantra == "black magic")  But it
is not the case that samayachara is the only Vedic tantric path.  A great
scholar like Shri Bhaskararaya insists that kaulachara can also be
concordant with Vedic practices and any apparently immoral tenets in it
are meant to be understood only symbolically.

Btw, there is another classification of the Shaiva shastras as follows:

* 10 Shiva Agamas which teach dvaita siddhanta
* 18 Rudra Agamas which teach a vishishtadvaita siddhanta

(These are the basis of Shaivasiddhanta, Kashmiri Shaivism etc.)

* 64 Bhairava Agamas or Tantras which teach advaita siddhanta.
* The Vamakeshvari Tantra which is the essence of these 64 and the basis
  of Shrividya.
