Translating the idea behind nishkAmya karma as "renouncing" is misleading. 
Detachment towards the fruit of the action does not mean that the action is 
to be performed indifferently. Knowing beforehand that we cannot control 
success or failure does not mean that we should not try for success. Rather, 
the idea is that the action is to be performed with all one's ability, 
dedicating the outcome, irrespective of what it is, to God. Only, the desire 
that the fruit of the action should accrue to our private benefit should be 
given up.
