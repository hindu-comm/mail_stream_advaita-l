Namaskaram.
 I just wish to point out that renunciation of action is very different from
renunciation "in" action ... to my knowledge, none of our shastras advocate
renunciation of action. For any being, action is the inherent nature. Trying
to not act is an action as well. One must recognize the futility of running
after the results of action ... so, when the action is performed as a sacred
duty, not as want for the result, things get a lot simpler, IMHO. 
 I am not saying it's easy to practice. I am just pointing out what has been
pointed out to me many times before - the goal of aspirants in the path is
not to give up action, but to give up the attachment to the results ...

bhava shankara desikame sharaNam
Vaidya.

Namaste,

Dear Jaldhar, I really liked your answer. However, given a choice between
"performing action" and "renunciation of action", is it not better to choose
the latter when the former involves doing something "wrong(?)" even if the
"wrong(?)" thing is the only alternative? Of course, this is the basic issue
on which the bhagavad gIta is based, but I never really got Krishna's point
here. Can you or someone else please explain? I would appreciate it if you
use the example of the mahAbhArata war itself. For instance, what would be
so wrong if Arjuna renounced worldly life instead of fighting the war?
Thanks.
