Namaste,

My name is Achala and am residing in the US for the past 2 years. I came
to know of Advita-Vedanta.org through my husband a member of your
organization.

My knowledge about Vendanta isvery little. As said, tiny drops of water
together make a mighty ocean. I wish to know more in Vedanta and
Philosophy by adding more drops of water(knowledge) to my current
knowledge and broaden my mental horizon.

I would really appreciate it if you could provide me that opportunity.

Regards,

Achala.
