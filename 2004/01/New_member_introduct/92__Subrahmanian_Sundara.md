Dear Smt. Latha Vidyaranya:

If I remember right, you had started a thread on Srimad Bhagavatam (based on some cassettes), but had to discontinue your membership owing to your need to fulfill your duties in life and adhere to your Master's teachings.

If you now have the time, I request you on behalf of the list to continue (possibly re-start) your series on the Great and Glorious Bhagavatam aka Paramahansa Samhita.

Regards,
SVS
