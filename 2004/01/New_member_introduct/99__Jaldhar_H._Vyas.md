harih om,

I confirm my interest in subscibing for vedanthic articles, I developed an
interest after hearing swami dayanand saraswathi talk about 3 years
ago,and since then listened to, and read many of his articles.I have been
attending regular upanisad classes of his disciple swami paramarthananda
and have listened to many of his commentaries on various prakarana
granthas including panchadasi. I am a consultant gastroenterologist by
profession.
