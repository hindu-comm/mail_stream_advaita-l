In 8/16, lord Krishna says that who so ever goes to Brahma Lok,  they will 
have to return to mundane world. On the other hand, in 8/24, he advises 
Arjun to attain solar path. It is said that the souls of this solar path 
will also eventually go to Brahma Lok. In that case, they are also subjected 
to the condition of 8/16. But Lord Krishna says that these souls will attain 
salvation. How is that possible.
