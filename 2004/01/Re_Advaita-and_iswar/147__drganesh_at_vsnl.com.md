ADVAITA AND ISWARA

Upanishads negate superimpositions that empirically exist. It is not that iswara is set up as some sort of fictitious entity merely to serve the higher purpose of negation. Brahman is declared by the sruthi to be the efficient and the material cause of the objectively existing world. When Brahman is spoken of in the context of the causality of the world, it is Brahman as iswara that is referred to. The negation of iswaratva  in Brahman is concomitant with the negation—or to be more precise the ascertainment of the mithyatva—of the relation of the effect to the material cause. For when the effect, the world is found to be mithya, the material and the efficient causality of Brahman too is discovered to be mitya. But even then, at this level of the ultimate truth [paramarthah], it is less than accurate to say ‘Iswara is negated’. Rather it is the iswaraness of Brahman, the aspect of rulership etc that are relational to the creatorship of a real world, that ultimately ‘disappear
s’ leaving the the unconditioned awareness-being, the parabrahm, appearing as, or being only as apparently transformed  [vivartha] into the universe.

Thus in statements about superimposition and negation we should not downplay the iswaratva aspect of para Brahman and mistakenly believe that iswara is just a fiction posited for purpose of negation. To do so will ignore the undeniable existence of the vyavahara world [mithya though it proves to be on enquiry]. Thus the understanding of Advaita requires the correct appreciation of the domains of vyavahara and paramartha, and the making of a proper demarcation between each, while yet being able to appreciate, the seeming paradox of two simultaneous ‘levels’, or perspectives, of truth.

Hence, gnanis like sankara while writing vedantic texts and while starting teaching always invoke the grace of the lord at the beginning and this is done for the sake of completion of their intended job. Every work they do is a vyavahara even when the content of the text is ‘jeeva-iswara ikyam’; and in the vyavaharic reality iswara’s grace is needed. That is why sradha and bakthi is stressed even in vedantic study and in fact getting a right guru and the appropriate set up is possible only with grace of lord because vedantic study is also a vyavahara only. 
The liberated person continues to transact in the empirical world that is the manifestation of iswara, at the same time having the immediate knowledge that the untransformed, and thereby acosmic [nisprapancha], parabrahman, is the highest truth.
