Namaste,

I learned to see this point about killing the brothers and the elders in
Gita in a symbolical way. In fact, the Gita doesnÂ´t mean to really kill the
relatives but the relatives are a symbol for our bad habits and "defects" of
the ego. It is called "brothers and elders" because our "defects" of ego (
greed, lust, vanity, selfishness) are so dear to us, that killing them hurts
as if we were killing our brothers and elders.

Greetings to all.

Cecilia,

You have given a very wonderful, simple explanation. Thanks.

Namaste,

Latha Vidyaranya
