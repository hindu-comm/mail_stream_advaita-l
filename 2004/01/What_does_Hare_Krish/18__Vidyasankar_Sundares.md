I have no wish to enter into yet another interminable debate with an ISKCON 
follower, but I would like Arvind to clarify one thing.

What exactly do you mean by the term bonafide? It is thrown about for any 
and every thing - bonafide names of Vishnu, bonafide paramparA ... Are there 
any non-bonafide names of Vishnu that anybody has been using?

And do you mean to say that no paramparA is bonafide other than your own? 
And who certifies what is bonafide? Sri Prabhupada? Note that there is no 
current paramparA older or more "bonafide" than that of Sankaracarya. And 
please do not quote to us the verse attributed to Padma Purana - we've seen 
that a million times already.

Vidyasankar
