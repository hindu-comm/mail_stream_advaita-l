Because you are saying more than that.  You are also saying that
Chaitanyas' sampradaya is "bona fide" and "authorized" and that is the
source of its authority.  Yet it's historical origins and shastraic basis
are highly dubious.

Now take the example of Ramana Maharshi for instance.  While he obviously
had a good grasp of shastra, he did not formally teach it.  But those who
were experts in Advaita Vedanta could see that his teaching was in line
with Advaita Vedantic teaching and that was good enough from them.

I can and I do deny that.  Moksha is not really something that is
acquired.  All beings are and always have been free.  But they have been
misled into thinking they are in bondage and it is the destruction of that
false notion which is the highest purushartha.  All Gods, Gurus, and
shastras are subsuduary to the understanding which destroys false
knowledge.

No the limited childish notions of the nature of Bhagavan are disposed of.

No but apparently the author of "Easy Travel To Other Planets" did.

*sigh* See a neglect of logic starts affecting ones reading comprehension.
I said *Vaishnavas*  aim to be somewhere near Bhagavan.

And the highest stage of bhakti as we both agreed a couple of messages
back in jnana.  You said you've visited the Kanchi Math.  Did you happen
to see all the murtis there?  What do you think they were there for
decoration?

Every sampradaya claims these figures as authorities.  To claim them as
your own show where they have have suggested or even mentioned Harekrishna
mantra.  And not by Prabhupadas method of merely substituting it wherever
sankirtana occurs in a text.  Show me the actual words.

So why are you so averse to reading the Bhagavata in sanskrit?  you should
be fully confident that it will agree with your guru.

On the authority of Panini, Katyayana, and Patanjali.

well that's the difference between us then.  Neither I nor anyone I know
is a conditioned soul.  In the summer some are air-conditioned.  Is that
the same thing?
