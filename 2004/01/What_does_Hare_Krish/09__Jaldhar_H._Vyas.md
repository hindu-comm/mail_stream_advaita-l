As Vidyashankar wrote, there are no end to them because the idea that
jnana is the cause of moksha is the very purport of the upanishads.

> jnana and bhakti go hand-in-hand.

Advaitins say that jnana is the highest type of Bhakti.

Exactly.  Note that it is "understanding" which causes "coming."  Also
note the text doesn't say "constantly devoted" it says "satata yuktanam"
i.e. "constantly _joined_"  This is why it is important to learn sanskrit
rather than rely on someone elses say-so.

Advance in spiritual life yes.  As I said, there is no objection to this
as a practice.  But as a direct cause of liberation no.  If it were the
case we could just put on a tape 24/hrs a day and be done with it.

Yes *one* of nine.

By whom?  There is a popular saying quoted by Bhaskara Raya "kalau
chandivinayakau" which suggests that in Kaliyuga worship of Mataji and
Ganesh Bhagavan is the means of moksha.

Neither the Bhagavata Purana or any other shastra that explains the
nine-fold path of bhakti gives a special priority to namasankirtana.

Personally I don't feel either disturbed or anxious.  In fact most people
around me are not disturbed or anxious.

Ajamila was a wicked man his entire life and at his death was calling his
son whose name happened to be Narayana not God.  So he was in a state of
both sin and ignorance.  So how do you think he was without offenses?  Or
are you saying Bhagavan arbitrarily decides who is offensive and who is
not?  If so there is no pointing in chanting or anything.  You'll get
saved or damned regardless of your actions.

The moksha we refer to is the final release from the cycle of birth and
rebirth.  It is the only moksha worthy of the name.

This is why anyone who who is seriously practicing Bhakti will come to
jnana.  What kind of service can you give if you don't understand who you
are serving?  Take the example of a servant.  The loyal servant will not
just wait for orders but hasten to ascertain his masters wishes.  In the
case of Dharma the master wishes us to understand that in truth we are a
part of Him.  Even this is not incompatible with Bhakti.  Take the example
of lovers.  When two people are deeply in love a slight to one will seem
like a slight to the other.  Seperation will seem like torture.  You get
the idea.

That isn't the grammatical meaning.

If this "mahamantra" and "upanishad" is part of the most ancient Vedic
traditions don't you find it rather suspicious that staunch Vaishnavas
such as Ramanuja or Madhva have completely failed to mention it?  Or
openents of Vaishnavism -- even if only to refute it.  That even a
contemporary of Chaitanya like Vallabha have failed to mention it?  That
foreign travellers to India like Hsien Tang and Al Biruni who have written
descriptions of contemporary religious practices fail to mention it?
There seems to be no evidence whatsoever that either mantra or upanishad
existed prior to Chaitanya.
