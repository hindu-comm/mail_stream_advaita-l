So then what are we arguing about?  I'm getting confused by your constant

I also don't believe the Kanchi matha was not one of the original ones yet
I have the utmost respect for it and its leaders because they teach
nothing but pure Advaita Vedanta.  This is something we can determine for
ourselves by objective standards.  In the same way if we compare ISKCON
teachings with other more mainstream vaishnavism we see obvious
discrepancies.

To get back to Advaita Vedanta, its truth depends on not on the
personality of Shankaracharya or his being an avatar of Shiva Bhagavan or
anything but on logical conclusions based on clear premises.  It would
still be true if Shankaracharya never existed.

This is the bone of contention Advaita vedanta has with other darshans.
At best they can only bring you somewhere near Bhagavan.  Only Advaita
Vedanta can lead you to the knowledge of your essential identity with
Bhagavan.

If someone claims they have things like sampradaya, mantra, understanding
of the true purport of the shastras etc. then we should be able to put
them to the test.

And you should!  That's exactly the method you need to take to advance in
spiritual understanding.

Shankaracharyas comments on the word pariprashnena in this shloka
illustrate how he feels this process should occur:

...tena kathaM bandhaH kathaM mokshaH kA vidyA cha avidyA iti
pariprashnena |

by asking questions like "whence comes bondage? whence liberation?  What
is knowledge and ignorance?

Saying "I love Newton, I have full faith in Leibniz" won't do a bit of
good in learning mathematics if you don't open up a textbook and do some
problems.  In the same way faith is the beginning but it is not going to
be enough.  Nobody can give you moksha, it is something you have to take
the initiative for yourself.

That it is just different combinations of the names Hari, Krishna, and
Rama.

The so-called "upanishad" which no one prior to Chaitanya seems to have
heard of.
