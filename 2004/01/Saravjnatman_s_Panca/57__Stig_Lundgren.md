Vanakam Venkatraman,

Prakriya to be THE Central and chief one.

Yes. But as far as I understand, this is because Holenarsipur
Swami Satchidanandendra Saraswati holds that the other prakriyas
are variations of adhyaropa apavada in the sense that they
presupposes adhyaropa apavada. In other words, the method of
deliberate superimposition and rescission makes other methods
such as the analysis of the five koshas etc. possible. There is
no use in talking about koshas, awasthas etc unless there are
prior superimpositions on Brahman.

Warm regards
