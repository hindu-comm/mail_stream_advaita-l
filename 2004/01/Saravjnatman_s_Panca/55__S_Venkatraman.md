5. Karya Karana Prakriya

are they correct ? i think the Holenarsipur Swamiji holds the Adhyaropa Apavada Prakriya to be THE Central and chief one.

Namasthe Kathirasanji,

While Shri. Lundgren has replied your question about the book, I have a more mundane clarification to seek from you on the five prakriyas themselves. I could think of only 3:

1. Pancha Kosha Prakriya
2. Sarira traya prakriya
3. Awastha traya prakriya
