Namaste Kathiji,

>Does this book examine the five prakriyas (karana-karya
>prakriya, panchakosha prakriya etc....)?


No, the focus is not on these issues. The book deals primarly
with the Mahavakyas and their meaning. The title of SarvjnAtmanÂ´s
work is due to the fact that it is a small manual (prakarana)
composed of five (pancha) chapters.

Warm regards
Stig Lundgren
