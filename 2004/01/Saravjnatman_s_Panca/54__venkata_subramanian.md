4. Adhyaropa Apavada Prakriya
5. Karya Karana Prakriya

are they correct ?   i think the Holenarsipur Swamiji holds the Adhyaropa Apavada Prakriya to be THE Central and chief one.

Namasthe Kathirasanji,

While Shri. Lundgren has replied your question about the book, I have a more mundane clarification to seek from you on the five prakriyas themselves. I could think of only 3:

1. Pancha Kosha Prakriya
2. Sarira traya prakriya
3. Awastha traya prakriya

>From you question it seems Karana-karya prakriya is also one of them. Could you please let me know how exaxctly it is done? Could you also help me with the fifth one.

pranams,

Namaste Stigji,

Does this book examine the five prakriyas (karana-karya prakriya,
panchakosha prakriya etc....)? 

best regards,
