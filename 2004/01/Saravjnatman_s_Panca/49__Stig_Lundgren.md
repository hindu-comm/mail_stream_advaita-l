I´m not sure if I understand your question correctly. Do you mean
Saravjnatman´s Panchaprakriya (the book discussed in this thread)
or The Method of Vedanta of Swami Satchidanandendra Saraswati? If
you mean Saravjnatman, the answer is no. The translator (Ivan
Kochmarek) discusses the genuine works of Saravjnatman, though.
But if you mean Satchidanandendra Swamiji, the answer is yes. In
fact, the issue of Sankara´s genuine works are discussed on
several places in Method of Vedanta.

Warm regards
Stig Lundgren
