Does the book - Method of Vedanta deal with the issue of examining the works of Sri shankara to find which are genuninely his works ?

No, the focus is not on these issues. The book deals primarly
with the Mahavakyas and their meaning. The title of SarvjnAtmanÂ´s
work is due to the fact that it is a small manual (prakarana)
composed of five (pancha) chapters.

Warm regards
