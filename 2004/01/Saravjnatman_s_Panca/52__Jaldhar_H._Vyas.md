But bear in mind that the division into karma and jnana kandas is on the
basis of subject matter not position.  A work may be called "aranyaka" but
deal with upanishad subject matter.  Or another example Ishopanishad is
part of the Samhita of the Shuklayajurveda.  Not having read the
aitereyaranyaka I don't know if this is the case but it is a possibility.

This could be ideological.  Douglas Brooks in his writings on Shrividya
has noted that Upanishad Brahmayogis' commentaries on Shakta upanishads
tend to follow the more conservative samayachara rather than the more
common but (at least theoretically) more radical Kaulachara.  I agree that
he would have at least acknowledged Shankaracharya as the author had he
known it.

I think I read in one of the Kamakoti Pitha publications that the
Upanishad Brahmendra matha still exists in Kanchi and its acharyas are
"cousins" of the acharyas of Kamakoti Pitha.  I.e. both their lineages
have a common ancestry.  This would explain the common Indra Saraswati
suffix to their names.

Another possibility is based on the fact that the Rgvedic tradition
(aitereya is a shakha of Rgveda) has always been strongest in the
Maharashtra/Goa/Karnataka area.  So this bhashya may have been handed
down amongst Rgvedis in that area while a person from Eastern Tamilnadu
may not have known about it.
