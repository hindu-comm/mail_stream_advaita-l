Namaste,

The crux of Advaita as I understand it, is that God is impersonal. That he 
is formless,attributeless, nameless etc. (Please correct me if I am wrong. )
  If so, who are Vishnu, Brahma, Siva and why do we celebrate their forms? 
In reality if its maya which makes us think that they are Gods and we are 
mortals, then once we have the knowledge that we are them(tat tvam asi), 
should we still pray? For isn't it also true that Shankaracharya believed 
that Knowledge alone is sufficent for salvation? Again, please do correct me 
if I am wrong.
In short, would it be corrrect to deduce that the Great Acharyas like 
Shankaracharya found happiness within themsleves and  composed hymns & 
glorified the deities only for the benefit of the common people ?

regards
krishnan
