Dear group-members,

I am very interested about ancient scriptures, I borrowed one book in 
which have been published "little pieces" of scriptures. In this short 
indroduction was also list of different scriptures:

Forexample: Puranas: Brahma, Padma, Visnu, Siva Bhagavata, Narata; 
Markandeya, Agni, Bhavisyat, Brahmavaivarta etc
Veda-books

Devi Mahatmya
Yogabhasya
Manavadharmasastra (Manu)
Vedanta
Rishi Patanjali yoga-sutras
Sankara (Sankaracarya) Astavakragiita (JANAKA)
Brahmasutra
advaita-vedanta
Upanisad

So in this book which I read was only little pieces of stories and when 
read these I was fully fascinated.

I really wanted to know some links from which I could get these 
teachings completely, buy books or download some from web pages.

with best regards

Taina
