Namaste Sanjay,

Thank you very much for links. Now I can start!

I read today little pieces about discussion between Siva and Parvati. 
Discussion about time of Kali-yuga. How dharma is lessen in this dark 
time-period and how to practise in Kali-yuga time.

This opened my understanding very much, I have often wondered why there 
have no same kind wisdom than ancient time, but now I undersdant it is 
due of Kali-yuga. I understood it last very long time
and I wanted to know what happens after Kali-yuga? 

with best wishes

Taina
