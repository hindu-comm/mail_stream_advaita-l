Dear List members,

I am happy to tell you that a Tamil translation with
notes and the original Sanskrit verses of the
Maadhaviiya Sha.nkara Vijayam is now available. I
picked up a copy at the Kaladi Sringeri Mutt when I
visited it recently. 

The translation is by Sri Anantakrishna Sastry, who
was an aasthaana vidvaan at Sringeri.

A devotee has reprinted this book, at the behest of
Sri Bharati Tiirtha SvaaminaH.

The book gives the following e-mail contacts:

1. Lingammal Ramaraju Sastra Pratishta Trust:
shastrapratishta at yahoo.com
2. Sastraprakesika Trust: info at sastraprakesika.org,
phone: +011-44-28530975 (Chennai, India)

Sri Bharati Tiirtha SvaaminaH has written that:

tadidam sha.nkaracharitaM vidyaaraNyavirachita
maadhaviiya ... sarve.api shishhTAH tasyaiva sh.nkara
vijayasya aachaaryacharittra pratipaadane
praamaaNyamrarIkuravnti. 

The book is printed in nice paper and has a good
binding also. I think all advaitins will be find this
most authoritative history of sha.nkara very
invaluable.

Rama
