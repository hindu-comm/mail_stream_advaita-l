Obviously, one needs to approach a text with keen
sense of objectivity. If scrutinizing is the attitude,
I do not know if one will get any where. I guess
'scrutiny' has a negative connotation. Also, you must
see if the author is contradicting himself. That means
one should accept that Bhagavan Srikrishna did not
contradict his teachings of 2 nd 3 rd chapter in his
12 th chapter. 

I tend to believe that Arjuna did not
accept/understand  Bhagavan's teachings of 2 nd
chapter, so he had to continue with 16 more lessons.
So, one should explain all the remaining 16 chapters
without contradicting the 2 nd chapter message. 

Why with the help of a devotee ?? I guess, a devotee
is already biased. So, pick any one who has sufficient
background in Sanskrit and has ability to consistently
read the entire text with ONE dependable logic.

You may have freedom to pick even a devotee of Lord
Siva or Muruga and still arrive at the same meaning. 

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
