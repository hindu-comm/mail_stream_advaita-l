Veda also talks about the absolute which cannot be validated by our direct
experience. Just take 'jIva-brahma-aikya'. It is not the direct experience
of a mumukshu doing sAdhana. If he discards the veda after finding the
contradiction, then how will he ever
evolve? So even if direct experience is contradicted, he ought to have the
faith (shraddha) in the scripture and move on.

My point is that we have 'our own science' which has already found the
'Truth'. Why should we use the modern science as a yardstick?
