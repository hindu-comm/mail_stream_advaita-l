I have listened to Svami Ranganathananda of
Ramakrishna Mission talk about this subject, and he
talks at length saying that this is the wrong
interpretation of Sankara's words. He also uses the
same Sankara's commentary word by word and no where it
seems to say that these two are separate paths. To
some extent he sounds to say that from pravritti man
grows to nivritti; not as a different path.

It is worth while if you can read Svami
Ranganathanda's commentary which is very very
interesting and seems to flow along with the present
day scientific thought.
