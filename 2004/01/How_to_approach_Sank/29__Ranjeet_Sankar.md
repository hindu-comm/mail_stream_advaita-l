The commentary which I read also laid special emphasis on pravrithi and
nivrithi marga. It is a malayalam work written by Swami Chidananda Puri of
Advaita Ashramam, Kerala. He is a direct disciple of one of the SankAchAryas
in Puri (or Dwaraka..I forgot the right one).

Why should we insist that Vedanta should be consistent with 'present day
scientific thought'?
Why cant we think the other way round??
