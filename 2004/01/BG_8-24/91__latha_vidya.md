Namaste.

Thanks to Sri Sanjay verma for the 'technical' clarification. Did my humble-layman-explanation have a vague resemblance to it ?!

Pranaams,

Pranam to all,



The reference in the Brahma Sutras on this topic is BS IV.ii.7, where it states:



"And the mode of departure (at the time of death) is the same (for the knower of the qualified Brahman and the ignorant man) up to the beginning of the path (of the gods); and the immortality (that is spoken of) is the one that is attained without burning ignorance"



To which Shankara comments:



"It is but proper that the departure as described in such texts as, Speech is withdrawn into the mind (Ch. VI.viii.6), should be the same for the knower and the ignorant up to the point where they start for their respective separate paths; for this is spoken of without any distinctive specification. The ignorant man moves on, resting on the subtle elements constituting the seed of the next body and under the impulsion of his past works, for the sake of fresh experiences in a new body. But the man of knowledge pursues the path through the nerve (passing out of the crown of the head) lighted up by knowledge and leading to liberation. This fact is stated in the aphorism by saying, Up to the beginning of the path (of the gods).



Opponent:



The enlightened man has to attain immortality, which does not depend on going from one place to another; so how can there by any resort to the elements and the commencement of a path?



Vedantin:



As to that, the answer is that this immortality is relative for the man whose blemishes have not been totally burnt away  for one who wants to attain a relative immortality by virtue of his knowledge of he qualified Brahman without completely burning away his ignorance. In such a case both reliance on the elements and the commencement of a path are possible. For the sense-organs cannot move without something to rest on.

I hope my late contribution to this topic is not out of context.

Om Shanti Shanti Shanti

I think this does not apply to the aspirant who worships sOpAdika brahman
(brahman with attributes). Shankara clarifies in sUtra bhAshya (dont know
the exact reference) that sAdhaka who reached brahma lOka through saguNa
upAsana will merge in parabrahman after mahA pralaya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
