Namaste Venkat,
It was through Warrier's excellent translation of the
Bhashya of Shankaracharya on Bhagwad Gita that I first
came across Warrier. That is the only work that I have
of his, other than a copy of the Sita Upanishad that I
had found on the web.
I just did a Google search 'A.G.Krishna Warrier' and
found that he has been hard at work. I was not able to
look further at this for you as my wife is jumping up
and down...and the dog...wanting to go out for a walk
before it gets dark.  If I find out any more later I
will let you know,
Best wishes
