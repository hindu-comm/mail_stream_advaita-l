Namaste Shri Ken,

I presume Shri A. G. Krishna Warrier who has translated Sita Upanishad is the same Warrier who has also translated the Bhashya of Shankaracharya on Bhagwad Gita. Are you aware if he has translated any of the Shankara Bhashyas on the Upanishads? Many thanks and praNAms,

Venkat - M.
