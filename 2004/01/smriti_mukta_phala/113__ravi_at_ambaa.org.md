Dear Sri Ajit:

Thank you very much for pointing it out. I am very much interested in this 
work and at least I would like to get a copy for myself (which I plan to make 
it available online over a period of time). I will write to you in person 
about this.

Regarding the book in vidyavrikshah site. It is an English translation of the 
book "saMxepa dharma shaastram", an abridged edition of vaidyanaatha 
diixitiiyam with Tamil Translation. If you search advaita-L you will find the 
details of the book. It is being in sold for 35 Rs in India (heavily 
subsidized) and printed with NO copyright (under the command of kAnchi 
paramachaarya) so that anybody reporoduce and reprint the book. I will search 
and post the URL sometime later today. 

I have the book and it is a very nice summary of the work.


Ravi
