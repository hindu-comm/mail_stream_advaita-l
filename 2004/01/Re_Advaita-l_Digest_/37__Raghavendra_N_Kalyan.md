>>> I meant life after moksha. For Vaishnavas, individuality persists 
>>>after liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

I have no intention to interfere in this serious discussion, but just want to share a thought.

Persistence of individuality neither guarentees independance nor freedom from bondage to the notion of "I" ness and so cannot be considered to be a state of liberation.
