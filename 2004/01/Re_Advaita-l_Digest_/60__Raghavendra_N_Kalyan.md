A conception of being a servant of some entity, however great or good that entity may be, can never be called liberation. Slavery or bondage may be the more appropriate word for that state. We dont need to break our heads to figure this out, because it is simple common sense. The tendency to be free is the more natural tendency of living entities that I know. Indians, for instance, wanted freedom from British rule. As regards the tendency to serve, that may be the natural tendency of masochists, but advaita is for rational and sane people.
