I am writing this as a continuation of the present discussion on mukthi. Geetha is a smrithy grantha and whenever doubts arise on slokas of different chapters which may appear contradictory ,we then generally fall back on the sruthi which is the very foundation of all our scriptures. Upanisads are the backbone of geetha.
The apparent differences in the meaning of slokas seen at various places are only because the very same topic is talked from two different angles. Both view points are correct from their respective standpoints.
When we talk of mukthi or ‘absolute freedom’ there are three terms generally used- Jeevan mukthi, videha mukthi and krama mukthi. All these differences are only from an agnani or a seeker’s point of view. From a gnani’s angle, once he has realized his swaroopam , has owned up his true status , identified himself with the adishtanam or substratum of all, then from that Brahman’s or infinity stand point there are no differences at all. Hence krama mukthi etc are talked about from ahankara or chidabasa’s angle and from chith’s or consciousness own stand point there can be no bondage or freedom as atma is ever free. Hence from a true advaitic stand point, mukthi can be defined as ‘dropping the notion that I am bound’ because the problem is only an adyasa. Infinity was free, is free and will ever be free and trying to reach it as an event or in a particular state of mind as in samadhi etc is not correct as I can never be away from infinity at any time.
