Namaste,

I have no intention to interfere in this serious discussion, but just want to share a thought.

Persistence of individuality neither guarentees independance nor freedom from bondage to the notion of "I" ness and so cannot be considered to be a state of liberation.

>>> It cannot be considered so if your conception of liberation is different. The spirit souls are eternal parts and parcels of Krishna (BG 15.7) and in their liberated state they are situated in Krishna's service. That is their natural constitutional and liberated position. The conception of "I am the servant of Krishna" is real ego while the conception of "I" or "I'm the enjoyer or God" is the false ego, which has to be given up. The tendency to serve is always there with the living entity, and this is also reflected in this material world - but, only when the living entity serves the Supreme it receives complete satisfaction, because that is his natural activity. 

Aravind.
