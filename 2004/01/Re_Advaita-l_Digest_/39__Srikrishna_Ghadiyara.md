hariH Om !!

Group Moderators:

To a limited extent this discussion was OK. But, now
with this continuous refutation and persistance of Sri
Aravindan to insist that ISKCONs view of God and
liberation is the paramount, and Advata philosophy is
not correct, I feel irritated. Specially because he is
not a scholar of Advaita Vedanta texts. Probably,
there will be many more who feel the same way. 

When I feel I have no other way, I will learn all
those details from ISKCONs website. For now, can we
stop this ISKCON propaganda.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
