This argument is given in brahmasutra 3.4.3 AchAradarshanAt ("by the
example of their conduct")  Janaka behaved as a doer despite being a
jnani.  (incidently, this argument is ascribed to Jaimini, the author of
the PM sutras.)  the rejoinder is given in 3.4.7 kAmakAraNe chaike
(by choice for some)  Those who know the futility of action nevertheless
sometimes do act.  Why?  Gita 3.20 gives the answer: for lokasaMgraha (the
benefit of the world) A king like Janaka may need to protect his people
from peril for instance.  But such karma is still inferior to naishkarmya.

I believe the Ramayana or perhaps the Vishnu Purana says that Janaka was
in fact reborn multiple times.  Even a jnani cannot magically suspend
cause and effect.  If one insists on performing actions one suffers their
consequences whatever ones intentions were.  The Mahabharata also says in
its 18th parvan that the Pandavas had to spend some time in Hell.  Even
though their actions had divine sanction, they still had an effect (phala.)

I don't know who this Marcaurelle person is but he didn't get his ideas
from Shankaracharya.  What is "inner" renunciation anyway?  Either one has
renounced or one hasn't.  A person who still maintains distinctions of
inner and outer hasn't renounced anything IMO.

We should make clear that the choice is not between studying PM or Vedanta
but between practicing Dharma or not.  If you are a grhastha and you shirk
your Dharmic duties, studying 1008 Vedantic books will not save you.

Yes but that doesn't alter the fact that actions are still being done.
(karma covers _all_ actions not just religious ones.)  This is why
Shankaracharya distinguishes between a sannyasi and a karmayogi.

Shri Rama was an avatar of vishnu Bhagavan.  The purpose of an avatar is
to explain pravrtti and nivrtti dharma.  So his appearing to be ignorant
and appearing to be liberated was only for didactic purposes.
