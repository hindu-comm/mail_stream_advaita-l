I had posted sometime ago the relevant dialog from "The Saint of
Sringeri" where HH Chandrashekhara Bharati of Sringeri discusses
saMnyAsa as a pre-requisite for VedAntic study. The final conclusion on
this topic is: "Ideally, only saMnyAsins should study vedAnta as per
the shAstras. In the case of householders, VedAntic study is not
prohibited, but their study will not lead to Self-realilzation." The
dialog is at:

In the gItA bhAshhya, Shankara says that it can be assumed that Janaka
attained "saMsiddhi" -- meaning that he came upto the dawn of
Self-realization, but not final Liberation itself. Besides, in the
jIvanmuktiviveka (JMV) of svAmi vidyAraNya, Janaka is said to have
attained the status of a brahmaGYAnI, but not a sthitapraGYa (one who
has attained firmness in BrahmaGYAna), and still needed to eliminate
his vAsanas. The reason: Janaka lacked firmness in the Four
Qualifications, and hence his BrahmaGYAna was also not firm. Such
people who attain infirm BrahmaGYAna while still in the householder
stage, are advised to take up vidvat saMnyAsa so that their GYAna may
become firm.

This practise of vedAnta by a householder has been considered in the
JMV. Shankara speaks of the "Royal Way" of sAdhana-chatushhTaya, then
sannyAsa and then study of VedAnta, and finally Realization. Some
people do not travel this way, in fact, JMV speaks of householders who
out of curiousity take up practising vedAnta and yet attain
BrahmaGYAna. BUT the JMV points out that these people will NOT have
firmness in their GYAna, and will need to take up vidvat sannyAsa to
attain mukti. I don't have the time to post all the extracts here, but
some portions may be found at

I've not read Marcaurelle's book, but it seems to be contradicting the
exposition of the shAstras by HH Chandrashekhara Bharati of Sringeri.

The AchArya does say that one can embark on the study of VedAnta ONLY
after the said Four Qualifications (which begin with viveka, vairAgya
etc.), irrespective of whether he has grounding in PM or not. But I
clearly specified that if one DOES NOT possess the said pre-requisites,
one has no other option but to practise dharma till the attainment of
the pre-requisite Qualifications.

One needs to understand the difference between pravR^itti and nivR^itti
dharma:

I agree with the above.

Two legitimate questions that can be asked are:

1) Is there an example of one who has attained the Four Qualifications
in perfection and still has not taken up saMnyAsa? 

2) Is there one who has attained Liberation without taking saMnyAsa? 

I can think of one example for both questions: shrI rAma is said to
have attained jIvanmukti with perfect Qualifications. If he continued
to rule the earth after that as a king, then I'm not sure the claim is
correct that sannyAsa is a pre-requisite for Liberation.
