|| bhava shankara deshikame sharaNam ||

namaste,

my name is ramakant, and i am 23 years old. My quest for attaining truth
through knowledge and truth can only be resolved when i can collect as
much resources to help me in my study of true religion and other aspects
of life. I am a person who believes in love, god, and good things that
life teaches u. I believe that all religion teaches good, only people
misunderstand these teachings or try to mislead others for thier own
personal interest.


I would love to join this group and recieve more information about its
beliefs and principles, so that i can accept whats good in my life and
work on them accordingly.





Thanking u, ur faithfully,


Ramakant G. salian.
