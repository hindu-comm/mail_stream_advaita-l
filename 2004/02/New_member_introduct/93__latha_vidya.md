Hari Om, Namaste.

Our heartiest congratulations to dear Nagabhushan S, a student who is so much interested to know more about Shankaracharya and Jagadamba. Nagabhushan, you are in the right 'sangha' and I am sure this will benefit you. Please feel free to seek any information that you may require to improve your spiritual knowledge. It is Shankaracharya's Grace that has brought you here. Blessed are you that at such a young age you have thirst for spiritual knowledge. May your tribe increase!

Namaste,
Latha Vidyaranya
