Namaskaram

My name is R. Kasthuri Rangan and I live in Chennai, India. I am 41 and a
smartha (Iyer).

I am an ardent devotee of Sri Durga who is my kula deivam and our family
is quite attached to the Kanchi Mutt. I have been blessed with strong
faith in the Almighty, the Vedas, our mantras and our religion. I have a
strong interest in jyotisham as well.

If there is any more information you may need, please let me know.

I hope to be a part of this list.

Sincerely
R. Kasthuri Rangan
