This is my understanding as well. Sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset will
change. Thus, the dates of observances might change. Since sunrise & sunset
change, rahu kala, gulika kala, and yama kala will also change by the
corresponding amounts. Eclipse timings and visibility may differ (I'm not
sure about this).

In either case, I already corresponded with Maria, and will be adding a
panchanga for Argentina in the next day or two.
