While Comans is correct that Shankaracharya does consider Ishwara and
Parabrahman to be two aspects of the same thing, I don't understand his
reasoning.

The brahmasutra 1.1.20 is antastaddharmopadeshAt "within, by the mention
of its activities"  dharma means activities but it could also be
translated as characteristics in this context as they are defined by
actions.  The text it discusses is Chandogyopanishad 1.6-7 which describes
the golden person who is in the sun and the person who is seen in the eye
who is the same as that person in the sun.  The opponent suggests that
this refers to Surya Bhagavan the presiding deity of the Sun.  But
Shankaracharya says this refers to Brahman on account of the description
of various characteristics.  ("He is the Rk, Yajus, and Saman", "He is the
Lord of the worlds beyond the Sun")  which would not apply to Surya
Bhagavan.  The equation of Brahman to the person in the sun who is the
same as the person in the eye is for upasana (meditation.)  Inter alia,
Shankaracharya observes parameshvarasyApichchhAvashAnmAyAmayaM rUpaM
sAdhakAnugrahArtham "Parameshvara through Maya assumes forms at will to
fulfill the needs of the sadhakas"  Is this phrase the source of Comans'
confusion?  I think it is pretty clearly stating that the forms (rUpa i.e.
saguNa) assumed by Parameshvara are maya.  How is that "interchangeable"
or "indistinct"?
