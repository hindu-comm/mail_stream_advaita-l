>>Friend,
>>
>>Kindly excuse me for taking the liberty of writing this personal note to 
>>you. I am Ramanathan, a person deeply interested in Vedic studies and 
>>preserving the oral tradition. I attach a synopsis. Kindly go through the 
>>same where I have given full details.
>>
>>The total outlay to print the book Veda Vijnanam comes to around $ 1300 
>>(Rs.60000) and if a few philanthropic minded persons could share this 
>>amount, I think, there will not be any necessity for me to stretch my 
>>hands to one an all here. What I need is your kind participation by 
>>contributing a small amount so that I can go ahead with confidence.  The 
>>manuscript is entrusted to the press after availing a loan.
>>
>>I shall send complimentary copies to the donors so that the aim of 
>>spreading the message of the Vedas can be achieved.  The book is to be 
>>given to select Veda-pathasalas free of cost and is to be priced Rs.125/- 
>>for the public.
>>
>>I hope to have your active participation and am sure you will be able to 
>>sponsor the project in a big way. Best regards.
>>
>>Please reply.

>>Yajna-purushaya namah.

>>Best regards: ramanathan
