Subject: Fwd: Manasollasa

Dear friend, I am looking for the correct Sanskrit version of part of
the Manasollasa by Sri Sureshwaracharya.
It begins:  "Satchidananda rupaya...." bindu nadam taratmane..." and
ends with :  "Gurunam Guravenamaha"".  I apologize for the spelling
errors.  Hopefully you can set me straight.  Also, could you recommend a
version in Sanskit/English?
     Many thanks, Kevin Ryder
