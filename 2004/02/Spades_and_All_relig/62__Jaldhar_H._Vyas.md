The reason is that such people _are_ often some kind of fascist.  I'm
talking about the VHP style "Hindutva"  Now I don't know if you actually
subscribe to that line of thought (though "pseudo-secular" is a favorite
catchphrase of theirs) but the right wing are as guilty as the left of
distorting our Dharma.  They need to be opposed just as vigorously.
