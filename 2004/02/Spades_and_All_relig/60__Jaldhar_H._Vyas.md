Fraternity and brotherly feeling are all well and good but not at the
expense of truth.  If you believe that non-violence is the higher
spiritual path then, say, sacrificing a goat on Eid is not leading down
the same road, it is going backwards.  (and vice-versa.)  Fraternity may
mean you find things in Islam worth admiring but fraternity also means
informing your brother when they are harming themselves does it not?

This is where modern thinkers part ways with traditionalists in every
religion,  Traditionalists certainly view their faiths as being "complete
presentations of reality."  No doubt this may cause clashes but looking at
for example the Indian scene the real story is not there is "communal
skirmish" but that for every 1 incident there are a 1000 incidents of
people with different beliefs living side by side.  But if one claims there
is no truth or we can only partially know the truth, then any belief no
matter how crackpot it may be has to be accepted.  One can make a case
that the lack of critical thinking and ensuing woollyheadedness caused by
this approach make people more vulnerable to being misled by unscrupulous
politicians.

False analogy.

If one believes in the biblical commandment Thou shalt not kill, is it
wrong for them to treat the murderer as inferior.  Must they accept poison
in their tea as "a valid approach"?

The ironic thing is comparing and contrasting is precisely what Swami
Krshnananda is doing here.  "Take everything for what it is" is fine
rhetoric but I challenge you to find one person who actually behaves that
way.

Shankaracharya glosses shraddhayA (with faith) as:

shraddhayA Astikyabuddhaya

"with faith means with astika intelligence" I don't know quite how to
translate astika into English.  Orthodox?  Positive?  But the point is he
is making a value judgement, a potentially exclusive one.


He glosses avidhih (not according to the Vedic injunction or method) as:

avidhiH ajnAnaM tatpUrvakam ajnAnapUrvakaM yajante ityarthaH

not according to the Vedic method means without sacrificing without
knowledge.

He glosses sarvayajnanam ("of all sacrifices") as:

sarvayajnAnAM shrautAnAM smArtAnAM cha

Of all sacrifices = of all based on Shruti and Smrti

That karma bears fruit even without knowledge we have recently seen is a
basic Mimamsaka doctrine.  However elsewhere in the Gita and in we see
that although such worship bears some fruit, it is inferior compared to
jnana and karmayoga.  See also B.G. 9.25 and 17.4 and the bhashya
thereon for other examples of gradation of divinities and methods of
worship.

I hope the explanations above have satisfactorily shown you that
Shankaracharya is quite consistent in considering non-vedic paths to be
inferior (though perhaps useful to varying degrees) to vedic paths and
vedic paths based on karma to be inferior to those based on jnana.
