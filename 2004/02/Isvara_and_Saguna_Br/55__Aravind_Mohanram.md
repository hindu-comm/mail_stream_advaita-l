I read a scholarly work on Advaita which said that they are not. When Sankara differentiates between absolute brahman and isvara (when he invokes two levels of reality), isvara and saguna brahman are synonymous, but not when the term isvara is used by him to refer to absolute brahman, which the author says Sankara does in certain passages - he uses isvara, paramatman etc., interchangeably with para brahman and when he does that isvara is given a different meaning compared to saguna brahman (which denotes the world-creator). comments?

Aravind.
