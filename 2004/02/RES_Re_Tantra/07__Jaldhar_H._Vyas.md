True.  the beauty of a classic like the Mahabharata is that it can be read
on several different levels.  But the literal level appeals to me the most
because it really puts into sharp focus the moral dilemnas we mortals have
to face.  To talk about doing good is so easy but to actually do good is
where the problems start!
