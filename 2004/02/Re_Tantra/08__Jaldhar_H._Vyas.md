What is today's competitive world?  In olden times people used to kill
each other for food.  Isn't that competitive?  How is today different?

Artha and kama are valid purusharthas for a grhastha when disciplined by
dharma but even then one has to soberly look at the situation and examine
ones assumptions and motives.  People lie to each other but the saddest
thing is they often lie to themselves.  That's why Advaita Vedanta
recommends self-enquiry as a vital component of sadhana.
