Not that I am aware of though I haven't really studied the subject.  It is
true as you mentioned in your other post that he is more inclined towards
yogic practices etc. but at least from what I've read of his other works,
he doesn't seem to beholden to tantric ideologies.

Probably the ascription was due just to a scribal error caused by the
similiarity of the names.
