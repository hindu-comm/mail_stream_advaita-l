No where did you get that idea?

That's the negative way of phrasing it but you can also think of it as God
is all forms, attributes names etc.

These are the forms in which the Rshis came to know the divine.

The problem with Maya is not it makes us think some are higher and some
lower.  That's just a symptom.  The real problem is that it makes us think
there is difference (bheda) at all.

The difference in the prayers of a deluded man and a jnani is that the
former prays to something apart and the latter prays to the divinity
within himself.

Knowledge _is_ salvation.  Devotion in its highest form _is_ knowledge.

I don't approve of such arguments.  They smack of duplicity.  It's as if
on one hand they are saying to the traditionalists "See we are not
radicals like those evil atheists" and to the modernists "See we are not
superstitious like those religious fanatics"

If one truly believes in benefitting the common people (however that's
defined) then one owes them nothing less than the truth no?
