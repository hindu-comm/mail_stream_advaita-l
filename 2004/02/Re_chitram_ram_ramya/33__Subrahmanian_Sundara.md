Dear Prof VK,

"chitram ram ramyate tam ..." What is the meaning of "ram" here? 

It is ramramyate, the first ram is not separate.  "ram" is an Atmanepada root declined as ramate (enjoys) and in passive is ramyate (enjoyed).  But this particular construct is a bit irregular to indicate "atyantena ramyate" - enjoyed very much.

If I remember correctly, this is listed and mentioned in the Amara Kosha.
