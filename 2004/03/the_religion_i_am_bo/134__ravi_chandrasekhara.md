Dear All,

I agree with Lata's statements.  How can one convert
to Hindusim, what caste are they, etc.  The samskaras
and adhikara associated with such is based on birth.

Now one can visit a temple, read books, and even
worship Rama, Krishna, etc and still be a member of
their birth based religion (at least from a Hindu
perspective; I dont know if Jewish, Islamic, or
Christian leaders would agree).  

With regards to Adi Shankara converting Buddhits etc;
their ancestors were Hindus;  (Adi Shankara did not
convert Tibetan Buddhists to Hinduism) I have
anecdotally heard one revert to one's ancestral faith
if generations before were converted out.  As far as "
converting " from Shavism to Vashnavism, these are
ideological differences not necessarily religious ones
per say.  For example Brahmins are allowed to
intermarry (as long as they are of different gotras)
per shastra regardless of ideological and geographical
variations. (Iyers and Iyengars intermarrying)

Pranam,

Ravi Chandrasekhara
