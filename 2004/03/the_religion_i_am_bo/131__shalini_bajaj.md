Namaste taina
       it was nice to read your experience and it changed me in my thinking 
as i stongly disagree with conversions in religion and still feel that 
forced conversion are not right. But i can see your point that you felt 
close to the teachings of hunduism and they were right for you.I dont 
understand why people create so much fuss about religions and fight for it.. 
i see religions as path to spirituality and it should be individuals choice 
what they want to take as in what religions they want to follow to reach  
spirituality.
as i am still novice in this filed i dont know about lot of things and 
wanted to ask you where can i read aboutthe discussion you mentioned between 
Sri Ramana and Paul brunton.
       may peace be with you all
        shalini
