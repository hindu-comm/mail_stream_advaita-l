I was a member of the list earlier and am rejoining the list. Born in a
Tamil Iyer family in south India, I was introduced to Advaita Vedanta at
an early age both by family traditions and through my father Venkataratnam
who avidly read works of Shri Ramana Maharishi, Swami Chinmayananda and
others. Currently living and working in Boston, MA I have been fortunate
enough to continue the practice as a student of Philosophy foundation
(http://www.philosophyfoundation.org) where we read and practice the
teachings of Shankara, and by also by attending Ramana Satsangs
(http://www.arunachala.org/Ashrama/Events/content.html). By joining the
list I hope to learn and contribute to the understanding of the dharma.

Regards,
Venkat Shrinivas
