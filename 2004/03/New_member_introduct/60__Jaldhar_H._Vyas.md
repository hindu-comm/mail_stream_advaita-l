Namaskaram,

I am a student at Texas a&m University. I was born in a Telugu Brahmin
family that practices shivitism.  My friend and me have interests in
vendanta. He is a vaishnavite and I was surprised how different schools
preach vendanta differently, although it is a sources remain the same
(Vedas and Upanishads).  My knowledge is very limited. I would want to
learn more about advaitha. I do not want to post any articles. I would
just want to read them. It would be convenient if I could receive them in
my email. I thought it would be a good time to start. That's the reason I
signed up for the listserv.
