Dear  Sir(s) ,

Namo Namah.

I would like to join the Shaankara group .

My introduction is as follows :

Maitravarun Kaundinya gotrotpanna Aashvaalaayanasootra Rikshaakhaadhyaayee
ROHIT UBHAYAKER Sharma aham bho abhivaadaye .

I am a Smaartha Brahmana of the Saarasvata group . My family has
traditionally owed allegiance to Shri Chitrapur Matha , near Bhatkala .
Our Mathaadhipati is P.P. Shrimad SADYOJAATA SHANKARAASHRAMA SVAAMIJI .

The primary reason for wanting to join this group is Bhagavaan Shri Aadi
Shankaraachaarya Himself .

I want to know more about Him .

For instance , last year on my yaatraa to Shri Ashtavinaayaka at Morgaon ,
I found that Shrimadaachaarya had visited that place . I was also told
that He stayed there for some days and re-estblished the ancient idol of
Lord Mayureshvara as well as arranged for the worship there.

With  Love ,

Rohit N. Ubhayaker.
