I am from the southern part of India from a family of vedic heritage from
a small town and brought up under Krishna Yajur vedha parampariyam,
Shankara Bhagavadh paadaal's advaitha gnanasmaranam. I am also deeply
attached to Bhagawaan Shri Ramana maharishi. As part of the satsangh here
in Ottawa where I live, we perform vedic chanting and satsanghs to discuss
and share our thoughts on our upanishadic scrptures. Our Sunday satsangh
involves Srir Rudram(with Lagunyaasam),Chamakam,all sukthams,
Sivoopasanam,Panchashaanthi, Dhahara Vidya, Vedoktha manthrapushpam and
Sivakavasa mangalam. It is the time our group looks forward to every week
as it gives the opportunity with the Absolute SELF.

I happen to hit upon some of the articles in the advaitha-l group and
prompted me to enlist, as a mumukshu in abhyaasam mode. 'ShradhdhAvAn
