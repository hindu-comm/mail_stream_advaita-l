RBB: Correct. Once mahapralaya happens, then the liberated souls will attain 
the divine. No doubt of it. But, for example the following sutras come after 
IV.3.10 sutra:

* IV.4.8 (Sankalpadeva tu tacchruteh)
*IV.4.10 (Abhavam baadariraha hyevam)
* IV.4.15 (Pradipavadavesastatha hi darsayati)

As per your reply, the application of these sutras to liberated souls is 
done before pralaya. However, these sutras are sequenced in the scripture 
after mentioning of IV.3.10 sutra, giving a false idea that they are applied 
after the pralaya. Therefore, my question was that it could have been much 
more appropiate if the above sutras are sequenced before IV.3.10 sutra. This 
way, it would be very clear that these sutras are associated with liberated 
souls before pralaya.

My sincere apology if it hurts any members.

Namaste
