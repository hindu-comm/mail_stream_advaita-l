The liberated souls at Brahma Lok will get all lordly powers, except the 
power to create and to dissolution of universe, (Brahma Sutra, IV.4.17). I 
have doubt here. Is this situation, where the liberated souls are distinct 
from divine and have all lordly powers, last till the time of pralaya only? 
If yes, then it makes sense that after merging in divine the liberated soul 
becomes divine itself with unlimited powers.
