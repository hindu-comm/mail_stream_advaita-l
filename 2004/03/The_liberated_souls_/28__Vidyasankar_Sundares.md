"The Brahma Sutra IV.3.10 talks about dissolution of
Brahma Lok (thus all other lokas also) and attainment of liberated souls and
Lord Brahma to higher region. As per this sutra, the liberated souls achieve
the absolute salvation. If it is so, then why the remaining BrahmaSutras
talk about the fulfilling of desires by mere will, having all powers except
creation and dissolution of universe, or to exist with or without a body
etc. Once these liberated souls got the absolute salvation, then where is
the question of limited powers etc to these souls?"

The dissolution of brahmaloka is at the very end, the mahApralaya. Those who 
attain brahmaloka in the meantime reside therein till the final dissolution. 
Attaining brahmaloka is not the final mukti, however. Sruti says, "te 
brahmaloke tu parAntakAle parAmRtAt parimucyanti sarve". The sUtras that you 
refer to talk about what happens between the time one reaches brahmaloka and 
the time of final dissolution. Logically, these sUtras have to follow after 
IV. 3. 10. I hope this clarifies your doubt.
