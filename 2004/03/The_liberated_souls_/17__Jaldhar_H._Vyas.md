The text of the sutra is vikAravarti cha tatha hi sthitimAh "and beyond
all forms because the situation is indicated"

vikAra is forms becaused forms are produced (i.e. are modifications of
other things.)  That there is something is beyond all forms is indicated
(by the shastras.)

It is interesting in light of our current discussions that on this sutra,
Shankaracharya quotes Chhandogyopanishad 3.12.6 which states one quarter of
the Purusha is all beings and the other three quarters are immortal in
heaven.  This is a direct quote from Rk 3 of the Purushasukta.  This shows
that although the Purushasukta is part of the karmakanda, it has
influenced Vedantic thinking also.

No  those virtuous souls who go on the Devayana also reach the worlds of
the Gods and attain saguna Brahman.  The difference between them and the
liberated souls is that when their punya has run out, they will return to
sansara while the liberated souls do not.

What this adhikarana of the Brahmasutras is trying to show is that
kramamukti is not a merging into Saguna Brahman followed by a merging
into Nirguna Brahman at the pralaya.  Because Saguna Brahman is not a seperate
entity just the partial, visible aspect of the one Brahman.  The liberated
atma may attain superhuman powers but it does not become Ishvara Himself.

That amongst those on the Devayana, those who know Brahman never return
from Brahmaloka.

No because as I said the relative and the transcendental are not seperate
but two aspects of the same.  Whether the sadhaka will truly understand
Brahman as saguna or nirguna depends on his spiritual maturity.
