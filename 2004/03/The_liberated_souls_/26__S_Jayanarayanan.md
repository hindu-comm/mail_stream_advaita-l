There is no logic in what you're saying.

I think you've failed to grasp what HH is trying to say. sAyujya is
simply NOT mukti, as mukti is BEYOND sAyujya also. In other words, in
the advaitic sense, there is sAlokya, sAmIpya, sArUpya, sAyujya, and
"mukti in the true sense of the word".

You've taken a stray verse out of the purANas, where the word "mukti"
is used differently than in philosophical advaitic texts. There is
absolutely no basis for your claim whatsoever.

You've gone to a totally unrelated verse now. The above verse from the
avadhUta gItA is not to be interpreted as denial of the ontological
status of the philosophies at the vyAvahArika level. The denial is only
at the pAramArthika level.
