Dear  Saadhaka ,

Namo Namah.

I  have  with  me  Shri Kapilopadesh  published  by the  Shri  Raamakrishna  Math  and  Mission . The  Sanskrita  text  and  English  translation  are  given .However  this  book  is  from  the  Shrimad  Bhaagavatpuraana . Is  this  what  you  want ?

Please  check  up  at  Shri  Raamakrishna Math's  bookshops or  their  on-line  store  for  the  same.

With  Love ,

Rohit N. Ubhayaker .
