In the past I have written about the several different strains of Samkhya.
Please see the archives for details.  The Samkhyasutras represent a later
kind of Samkhya which is heavily influenced by Vedanta.  The Kapilopadesha
(or Kapila Gita) in the Bhagavata is yet another.  As Shrikrishna said,
Samkhyakarika, is a more authoritative source for "classical" Samkhya
along with the commentary Samkhyatattvakaumudi by Vachaspati Mishra the
celebrated Bhamatikara.  Swami Virupakshananda of the Ramakrishna Mission
has translated this into English.
