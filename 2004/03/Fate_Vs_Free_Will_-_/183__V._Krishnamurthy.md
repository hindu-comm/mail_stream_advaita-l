Namaste

The limited sphere of influence of Fate (Prarabdha) on us
and the necessity to resort to freewill in our responses to
our obligations (which should be taken seriously) and to
the happenings (which should be taken lightly)  -- all
these are exhibited in chart form in 
http://www.geocities.com/profvk/LHGWchart3.html
and 
http://www.geocities.com/profvk/LHGWchart4.html

Please let me have feedback on  whether the charts say the
right thing on the aspects of Fate and Freewill Thanks. Of
Course the charts are entitled "Live Happily the Gita Way"
and were used in a series of lectures on the topic.

PraNAms to all seekers of Truth.
