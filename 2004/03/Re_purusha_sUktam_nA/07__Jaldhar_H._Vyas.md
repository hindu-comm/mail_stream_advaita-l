As far as I know it is the same one.  I know it is 10.90 in the Rgveda for
instance.

In the vajasaneyi samhita, adhyaya 31 has 22 rks devided into 2 suktas.
The first (16 rks) is called Purushasukta and the the second (6 rks) is
called Uttaranarayanasukta

But the Purushasukta begins sahasrashirShapuruShaH so I wonder if we
indeed are talking about the same thing.

The patha in Shuklayajurveda as I learnt it is shrIshchatelakshmishchate
(31.22) Shri makes more sense.

Again in the shuklayajurveda they are considered seperate suktas although
connected due to their employment in the purushamedha.  It seems in the
krishnayajurveda traditions of our south Indian members, they are
considered as one.  For instance the quote "jayamano bahudha vijayate" Dr.
Ganesh gave comes from uttaranarayanasukta (31.19)

This goes to show you in Vedic matters one should go by family tradition
not what one reads in books.

Yes and also note my post on Brahmasutra 4.4.19.  So perhaps it was too
much to say the purushasukta is not relevant to Advaita Vedanta but still
I think it is a stretch to say it represents Advaita per se.  Rather it
contains the seed of Advaita Vedanta, the ancestor of the line of thinking
that would develop into Advaita Vedanta.  But other darshans can lay claim
to it too.  Purusha is a vital principle in Samkhya.  The equation of the
body with the universe is a feature of Yoga too.

for every mantra there is a Rshi (the one who discovered it,) Chhanda
(metre it is sung in,) Devata (God it is addressed to) and viniyoga
(purpose.)  If the purpose is for ritual it is karmakanda. If the purpose
is to know Brahman it is jnanakanda.  But the line is sometimes blurry
because some ritual portions do get reinterpreted in an adhyatmic way.
