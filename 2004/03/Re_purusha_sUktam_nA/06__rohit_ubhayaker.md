Namaste Sri Jaldhar,

Is it that a hymn addressed to purusha occurs in all vedas or is it that the SAME hymn starting with "sahasra SIrshA ...." occurs in all the four vedas?

Which uttara-nArAyana sUktam are you talking of? The purusha sUktam itself contains pUrva and uttara nArAyaNa portions. I was asking about the nArAyaNa sUktam starting with "sahasra SIrsham devam..." Are you talking about the same? Please clarify.

I am sorry but I did not understand the connection. The uttara-nArAyaNa portion of the purusha sUktam says that the wives of the purusha are hrI and lakshmi. I thought hrI means pArvati. 

I have another doubt. Is the uttara-nArAyaNa portion (last six verses) considered as part of the purusha sUktam in the smArta tradition?

But aren't there some statements which do express advaita in purusha sUktam? Please refer to Ganesh's post and my previous post regarding this. Given a specific portion of the Sruti, how should we determine whether it is karma kanda or jnAna kanda? What about the nArAyaNa sUktam? Is it karma or jnAna kanda? Sorry about the number of questions.

Thanks & Regards
Raghavendra

Dear  Co-Saadhakas ,

The  Purusha Sookta  and  Naaraayana  Sookta ,  both  have  strong  Advaitic  undercurrents . Though  neither  seems  to  directly  refer  to  Nirguna  Brahman , Advaita  is  indicated .

In  the  Purusha  Sookta , Purusha  is  indicated  as  the  lord  of  Hrim  and  Shri . This  seems  to  point  that  the  rishi  of  the  sookta  thought  that  in  the  ultimate  analysis , Shiva and  Vishnu  are  non-different .

The  Naaraayana  Sookta  clearly  says " SA  BRAHMA SA  SHIVA  SA HARI  SENDRA ... ".This  also  leads  us  to  the  non -difference  in  this as  well .

The  basis  of  Shrimad  Shankara's  Shanmatasthapana  was  this  absolute non-difference  of  deities .
