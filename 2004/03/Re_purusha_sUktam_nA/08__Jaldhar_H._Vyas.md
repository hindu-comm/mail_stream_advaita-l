By strange coincidence my mother came back yesterday from a trip to India
and she brought me back some books one of which is called "Purushasukta
and Narayanasukta" by the RamaKrishna Matha, Chennai.  The English
translation is totally worthless but it is interesting because it gives
the krshnayajurveda patha of these suktas.

The Purushasukta (Taittereyaranyaka 3.12-13) is shown as being of 24 rks
in 2 anuvakas which mostly correspond to what I describe as the purushasukta
and uttaranarayanasukta.  However the order is different in the first
anuvaka. It goes by my numbering, 1,2,3,4,5,14,15,9,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,
two additional Rks: vedAhametaM and dhAtApurastAt, and then 16.  The
second anuvaka has the same number and order as vajasaneyisamhita 17-22.

The narayanasukta beginning sahasraShIrshaM devaM is Taittereyaranyaka
10.13.  The 10th kanda of this aranyaka is also known as
mahanarayanopanishad so it easy to see the Vedantic significance.
