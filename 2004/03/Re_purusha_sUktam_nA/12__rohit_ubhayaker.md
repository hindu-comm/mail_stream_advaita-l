just curious,

Is hrIH related to 'hrIm' - one of the bIjAksharas for
the devi? Do they both mean the same?

Savithri

Dear  Saadhaka/Saadhikaa ,

The  Devi  Maahaatmya  says " ... Lajjaaroopena  saunsthitha ..."
So  if  "Hrih"  means  lajjaa , then  it  can  mean  the  Devi  as  well . The  Devi Geetaa , which  has  strong  Advaitic  undercurrent , lays  great  stress on  "Hrim" , which  it  calls  as  equal  to  "Aumkaara".

Thus , they  can  mean  the  same  thing .

In  the  final analysis , Sarasvati , Lakshmee , Durgaa , Lalitaa ,etc  are  are  all  One anyway . This  has  shaatraic  confirmation , again  from  the  Devi  Maahaatmya . In  Chapter10 , Shri Bhagavati  saya  to  the  demon king Shumbha " Who  apart  from  Me  exists ?"

     BHAVA  SHANKARA  DESHIKA   MAE  SHARANAM.

With  Love ,

Rohit  N. Ubhayaker.
