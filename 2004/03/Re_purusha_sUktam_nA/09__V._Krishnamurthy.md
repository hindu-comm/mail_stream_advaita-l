The word 'hrIH' means 'Modesty'.  'shrIH' means Wealth and Prosperity. The line 'hrIshca te lakshmIshca patnyau' says that 'Your Consorts are Modesty and Prosperity.

The word 'hrIH' is a very significant word in Vedanta. Shankara in his Bhashya on Sanatsujatiya, writes for 'hrIh' : "akArya-karaNe lajjA" -- sense of shame in doing the wrong thing!

Pranams to all seekers of truth.
