The Peetha was vacant for many decades .Now with the help of P.P.Jagadguru Shankaraachaarya Shrimad Bhaarati Teertha Mahaasvaamiji of Shringeri , the vacancy is being filled .

The initiation into Sannyaasa for the incumbent is being done by P.P.Shrimad Sadyojaata Shankaraashrama Svaamiji of Shri Chitrapur Matha , at Shiraali near Bhatkal .

P.P.Shrimad Sachchidaanand Jnaaneshvara Bhaarati Svaamiji of Shri Kirkee Matha , near Honnavar is also to attend .

Let us all pray at the feet of P.P. Shrimad Bhagavadpaada that the new pontiff be blessed with a long life and spiritual realization

BHAVA SHANKARA DESHIKA MAY SHARANAM.

With Love ,
