praNAms prabhuji
Hare krishna

Pardon me, nothing comes to my mind as regards to shruti reference about
svargAdi lOka.  mrutyOh sa mrutyuM gachhati ya iha nAnEva pashyati (!!) -
kAtaka shruti may be remotely talking about it...but not sure about
it...this is more of jiva's entanglement in samsAra.  In gIta you have
trividhaM narakasyedam dvAraM nAshanAtmanaH etc. but this also can be
interpreted differently taking context into consideration.  I request Sri
Sunder prabhuji to help us in locating the shruti references.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
