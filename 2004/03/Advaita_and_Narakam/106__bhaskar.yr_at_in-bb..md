praNAms
Hare Krishna

Shankara gives account of various lOka-s apart from bhulOka in gIta & sUtra
bhAshya-s such as  pitru lOka, deva lOka, brahmalOka etc.  Moreover, we've
elaborated description on various types of naraka-s in garuda purANa.  So,
we may admit that jIva under the influence of avidyA may experience the
pleasure / pains in the respective lOka-s according to his/her karma phala.
Since the existence of svarga/naraka is indriyAthIta jnAna,  we've to
consider what smruti-s & purANa-s offer in this regard.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
