Hari Om
Namaste

As long as I believe that I have a mortal body subjected to birth and death, concepts of Swarga, Naraka and all other injunctions stated by our scriptures are true. Once I develop firm conviction of the Ultimate Truth - existance of The One Without The Second and get established in that Truth, everything else dissolve.

Namaste,
latha Vidyaranya

What are the views of the Advaita Sampradayam on Narakam? Does it
acknowledge the existence or non-existence of Narakam?
