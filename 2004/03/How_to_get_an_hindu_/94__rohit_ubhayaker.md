I think, it is more appropriate to give complete title
and author and/or translator, while commenting on
books. Are you referring to PURUSHA-SUKTAM AND
NARAYANA-SUKTAM (Rs. 5) ? 

For example, I have the book of Ramakrishna Mission
titled SRI RUDRAM AND PURUSHASUKTAM
Translated by Swami Amritananda (Rs. 40) which has
commentary based on several classical authors. I can
not accept that it is 'worthless'.

Also, just because do not appreciate the translation,
the book does not become 'worthless'. I guess, there
are different levels of aspirants. Many people may not
be interested in elaborate commentary on Suktas. They
may be happy with simple translation.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna

Dear  Saadhakas , 

I  fully  endorse  the  view  of  Mr . Shrikrishna .

Just  because  a  book  doesn't match  to  the  "intellectual  level"  of  a  person , it  doesn't become  outdated or  useless.

Rather  even  the  smaller  version  of  the  book Purusha Sookta & Naaraayana  Sookta  is  very  useful  for aspirants  at  beginners  level .

The  efforts of  well  meaning  saadhakas  like  those  at Shri  Raamakrishna  Matha  should  be  appreciated , especially  in  the  context  of  modern  Hindu  society , where  most  Hindus  are  ignorant  of the  various  hymns leave  alone their  meaning.

Hats  off to  the  Mission  for  such  great  work .

With  Love ,

Rohit N.Ubhayaker .
