I think, it is more appropriate to give complete title
and author and/or translator, while commenting on
books. Are you referring to PURUSHA-SUKTAM AND
NARAYANA-SUKTAM (Rs. 5) ? 

For example, I have the book of Ramakrishna Mission
titled SRI RUDRAM AND PURUSHASUKTAM
Translated by Swami Amritananda (Rs. 40) which has
commentary based on several classical authors. I can
not accept that it is 'worthless'.

Also, just because do not appreciate the translation,
the book does not become 'worthless'. I guess, there
are different levels of aspirants. Many people may not
be interested in elaborate commentary on Suktas. They
may be happy with simple translation.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
