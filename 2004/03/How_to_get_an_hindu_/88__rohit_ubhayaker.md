Dear Srikrishna

Thank you for your clear e-mail.
Here we have a Ramakrishna Ashram. I have visited its
web page. I know there are a lot of Ramakrishna
Centers arrownd the world. I see that they teach
vedanta, but are they advaitins?
There is not another hindu temple here in my country,
except of the Hare Krishna Temple.
What is your/list opinion about Ramakrishna Ashram?
My doubt is that they celebrated christian Nativity
and other catholics festivities. Is it right to do
this? I am confused about it. 
Thank you all for consider my humble questions.

Om Namo Narayanaya!

María
