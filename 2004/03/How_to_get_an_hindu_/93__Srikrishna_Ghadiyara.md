When I saw the comment that the book 'Purusha-Suktam &
Narayana-Suktam' ISBN 81-7120-477-5 is 'worthless', at
first I felt bad. However, as I had the book, I read
it and feel that the translation and/or commentary is
really below standard. It does not seem to be correct
to the original Sanskrit words. Purusha being
translated as 'Sun-God' etc. does not seem to be
correct at all. There is more mis-interpretation than
correct-interpretation. Over all, I too feel that,
this will not serve the seekers any way. 

I have read the another book, The Purushasukta - An
Exegesis by Svami Harshananda and it is very fine and
helpful.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
