You are right. I referred to the English translation of Vishnu Purana (in five volumes) by H H Wilson. The reference is in Volume 2 of the translation.

Vishnu Purana, Book 2, Chapter 6.  Here go the relevant portions -

"Heaven (svarga) is that which delights the mind; Hell (naraka) is that which gives it pain. Hence vice is called hell and virtue is called heaven."

Some sentences later, it also says -

"Pleasure, pain are merely definitions of the various states of mind."

All these come AFTER the description of the various hells. Indeed, we advaitins are right about the interpretations of svarga and naraka.

Raghavendra
