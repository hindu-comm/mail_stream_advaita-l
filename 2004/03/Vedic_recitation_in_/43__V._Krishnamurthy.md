Namaste 

I just bumped into the following site which has authentic recitation of the following Vedic portions in a majestic voice:
1. Rudram and Camakam
2. Three chapters of Taittiriyopanishad
3. Some more selctions from the Vedas
4. Some Shiva stotras.

Those who have not heard these recitations ever, would surely be captivated. And those who have already heard these and probably can recite it themselves, would love it.

The site:

PraNAms to all lovers of the Vedic tradition
