Namaste. 

This is a question on a shloka whose full form I don't know
but it begins with "na gAyatryAH param mantraM". I vaguely
remember it as follows:

na gAyatryAH param mantram 
na mAtuH para-devatA /
na guroH paramam brahma
naikAdashyAH param vrataM //

Is this the correct version? Where does it occur? Are there
other versions?

praNAms to all  those whose respect the GAyatrI
