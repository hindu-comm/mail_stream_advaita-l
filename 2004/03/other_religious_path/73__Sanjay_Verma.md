Namaskaram,

While one may have one's own impressions of what Advaita and Christianity are,
Swami Vivekananda would vehemently disagree with the statement that the "Christian message is philosophically not compatible with Advaita"

Readers may refer to the following URL for Swami Vivekananda's talk on "Christ the Messenger".

If for no other reason, one may read it "for comparison purposes" and we can perhaps drop the subject, admitting that the prevailing view in Advaita Vedanta according to Shanrakacharya is in fact that "Christian message is philosophically not compatible with Advaita". 

The prevailing view; however, is not the only view and newcomers should also be made aware of that.

Om Shanti Shanti Shanti

Sanjay

Attempt by the other contributor to the list, to "justify" Christian claims by out-of-the-context quotes illustrates this point. Whatever the intent of the post was, Christian message is philosophically not compatible with Advaita, and newcomers are eligible to be made aware of it.
