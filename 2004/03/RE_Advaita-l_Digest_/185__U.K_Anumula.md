The basic principle of advaita is non-duality, in other words discrimination 
between man and man would be inconsistent with a true belief in advaita.  As 
a consequence, a true advaitin would eschew caste distinctions, 
untouchability and pride in one's own being a 'brahmin'.   This is stated 
not only as an egalitarian principle of societal harmony, but also as a 
principle inherent in the philosophy of advaita.

Secondly, advaita is not inconsistent with the practice of 'bhakti'.  Bhakti 
is a matter of faith whereas advaita is a matter of higher understanding of 
philosophy.  Therefore to practise advaita, apart from intense reasoning of 
one's inner self and behaviour, practice of bhakti is necessary.  Sankara's 
Bhaja Govindam points to this aspect of practical advaita.

A person indulging in self-glorification aboput his being a brahmin or 
smartha cannot be a true advaitin.
