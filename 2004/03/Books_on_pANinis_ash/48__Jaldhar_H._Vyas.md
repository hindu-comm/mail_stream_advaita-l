Are the teleconferences archived?  With my erratic schedule following any
kind of formal course is going  to be difficult.  Still I'd like to hear
an expert from time to time.  I feel like I'm forgetting a lot of what
I've learned lately and the commandment given in taittereyopanisads
shikshavalli is "Do not neglect svadhyaya"

I like how the Samskrita Bharati web page shows the Shiva or
Maheshvara sutras.  These are the foundation of vyakarana and as the name
suggests they were orignally produced from the beat of Shiva Bhagavans
damaru (drum.)
