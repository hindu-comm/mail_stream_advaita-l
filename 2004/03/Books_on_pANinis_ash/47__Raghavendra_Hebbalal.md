sarvebhyo namaH,

On a related note, there is a teleconference class on
the LSK happening every other week. It has been
organized by Samskrita Bharati
(www.samskrita-bharati.org) and taught from India by
Prof. Mahabaleshwara Bhatta, an expert in Vedanta and
Samskrit Grammar and author of several illuminating
books on vyAkaraNa-prakaraNAni like sandhi, samAsa,
kArakam etc., He just finished the first sutra (in the
LSK order) in the last class. 

He is using the same gItA press text book mentioned
earlier. 

This class, however, is taught completely in Samskrit
(no translations whatsoever!). Those attending this
class need to be able to speak and understand spoken
Samskritam and have a basic knowledge of vyAkaraNa.

Anybody interested can contact me or
samskritabharati at yahoo.com. 

dhanyavAdAH,
-rAghavendra
