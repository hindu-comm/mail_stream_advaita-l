virAj is the root, virAT is the nominative singular and virAjaH is the 
ablative singular.

tasmAd virAD ajAyata -

from (the purusha), virAT was born. The "T" in virAT gets softened to "D" 
(virAD) by sandhi rules, because it is followed by the vowel sound "a". 
Similarly, tasmAt (from that) becomes tasmAd.

virAjo adhi pUrushaH -

>From virAT, purusha (was born). The ending visarga "H" in virAjaH transforms 
to the "o" sound, again by sandhi rules. The ablative case indicates "from" 
- tat = that, tasmAt = from that; ramaH = Rama, rAmAt = from Rama; virAT = 
the excellent one or sovereign, virAjaH = from the sovereign.
