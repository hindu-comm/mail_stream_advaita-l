Namaste

Is it so, that if we met this sangha, it is Shankaracharya´s blessings who
brought us in touch, thru this list?

If it is so, it is really touching.

Thank you..

Sister Asuman

Hari Om, Namaste.

Our heartiest congratulations to dear Nagabhushan S, a student who is so
much interested to know more about Shankaracharya and Jagadamba.
Nagabhushan, you are in the right 'sangha' and I am sure this will benefit
you. Please feel free to seek any information that you may require to
improve your spiritual knowledge. It is Shankaracharya's Grace that has
brought you here. Blessed are you that at such a young age you have thirst
for spiritual knowledge. May your tribe increase!

Namaste,
Latha Vidyaranya
