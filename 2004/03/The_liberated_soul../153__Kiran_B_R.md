Well, we do have the example of Krishna Himself, don't
we, who even promises to come every yuga?

That the task/office is divine both irrelevant and not
mentioned in the sutra. That there IS a task is the
only thing of relevance, and the only thing mentioned
in the sutra. I would come, if at all, to eat juicy
jilebis!

...and? Can this guy be seen playing
"charioteer-charioteer" in wars or not? Or yeah, can
this guy be seen eating juicy jilebis or not?

Cheers
