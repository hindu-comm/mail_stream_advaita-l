Vidyasankar,

Correct, but the fact that the desire is satisfied
does not rule out the karma of actual return to
saMsAra. Such ruling out is only for the "sakta", the
ajnAni who feels "I do not require to eat jalebis, so
let me not return to saMsAra!". The shrEShTha said:

na mE pArthAsti kartavyaM triShu lOkEShu kiMchana |
nAnavAptamavAptavyaM varta Eva cha karmaNi ||

> On the other hand, if you would want to return to

Sure, I was not out of saMsAra! How can I be out of
myself? How can I be out of the pUrNa, the Brahman?

Jaldhar,

There is nothing that is not Brahman. "sarvaM
khalvidaM brahma"

> So why are we focusing on this one jalebi issue?

Because, you see, we're having fun with jalebis:-))

Cheers
Kiran
