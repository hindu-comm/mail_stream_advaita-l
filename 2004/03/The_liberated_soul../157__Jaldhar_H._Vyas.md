Then I apologize.  I had confused you with another list member who is a
dvaitin.  But I am rather surprised that someone who follows
Shankaracharya could formulate a question the way you did.

well I suppose any question genuinely asked is "good" in some way but it
is based on invalid premises

Because a jalebi is just a fried sweet.

If he is "purna" then what is there to return to?

Ok perhaps my example wasn't clear enough.  What I meant was there are
things that one does when young that are totally dismissed out of hand
when one is mature.  You or I don't have to ask ourselves "Shall I swallow
an ant today or not?"  It just never even occurs to us.  Again, the bliss
that is Brahman is so many scales higher than anything the mundane person
knows that it drowns out any lesser kind of bliss.

Right.  But statistically there is a greater chance of not eating a jalebi
than eating one is there not?

Yes.

Why when Brahman *is* the jalebi?
