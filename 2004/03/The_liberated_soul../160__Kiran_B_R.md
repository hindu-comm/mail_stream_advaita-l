If as brahman we can fool around like this, little
wonder that followers of the AchArya can formulate
questions like me!

Invalid premises such as?

> Because a jalebi is just a fried sweet.

Then (I repeat, "then") the vedas are just dusty
texts!

> If he is "purna" then what is there to return to?

Nothing but the "pUrNa"!!!

The jnAni can ask "Shall I swallow an ant today or
not?" as a rAga-dvEsha-vimukta.

So?

I have been saying why:
