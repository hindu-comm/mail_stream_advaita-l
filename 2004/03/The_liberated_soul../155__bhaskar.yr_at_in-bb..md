Acheiving jnana does not cancel
out existing karma but from then on, no more accrues and when the last of
it burned, the jnani becomes eternally free.

sAshtAnga  praNAms Sri Jaldhar prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for your kind reference prabhuji. But  I think kiran prabhuji is
questioning the *iccha* & capability (??) of eternally free jnAni ( who
does not have any residual karma phala ( karma SEsha) ) to come back to the
compartment of dEhAdi upAdhi-s & eat juicy jilebi-s:-)).  prabhuji,
surEshwara in Br. vArtika says in jnAni no trace of karma phala whatsoever
once he gets rid of pramAtrutva bhAva.  Neither pre-existing karma phala
nor any accruals of karma.  kshEyaNte chAsya karmAni, chidyante sarva
saMshayAH says shruti.  It would not be out of context if we recall kArikA
bhAshya  of shankara wherein he says : just as the janma & maraNa, going &
coming back as well as staying in a place seemingly pertains to the jar
space in ether, so also the birth & death seemingly pertain to Atman.  Does
it not imply coming back is *as real as* our exit??!!

Humble praNAms onceagain,

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
