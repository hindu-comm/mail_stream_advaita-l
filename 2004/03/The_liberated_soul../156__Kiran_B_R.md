Jaldhar, just because I ask questions, you must not
"outcaste" me! My guru is none other than Adi
Shankaracharya.

Even so, is the question good?

Why do you assume, take it for granted, that one who
wants to return to saMsAra "to eat juicy jilebis" is a
slave to his jihvA? Why do you assume that he is taken
over by desire?

He who comes back to eat juicy jilebis does not cause
any reduction in the "pUrNa" AnaMda:

Do not contradict yourself. The jnAni cannot see any
duality. He cannot see total bliss somewhere and
something horrifying somewhere else. "naivEha nAnAsti
kiMchana".

- said the Lord! Even granting that the jnAni feels
jalebi's are "yuck" compared to the bliss of the
brahman doesn't stop him from eating jalebis or taking
birth therefor.

If he wills, he eats jalebis without any reason (as
opposed to having the reason that he's a slave of the
senses). And if he does not eat jalebis, he does not
without any reason (as opposed to having the reason
that they're "yuck" compared to the "bliss of the
brahman" or of the company of soft music, wine and a
dozen willing maidens on a cool moonlit night).

Are you trying to prove that taking birth to eat
jalebis carries no responsibility, and taking birth to
classify the vedas does?

I never talked about any jivas. It is the brahman who
desires to eat jalebis.
