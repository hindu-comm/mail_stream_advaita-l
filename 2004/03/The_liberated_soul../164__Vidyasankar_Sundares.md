Methinks you have it exactly backwards. To begin with, if we are talking 
about a liberated soul who has attained the world of saguNa brahman, by 
definition, such a being is not an ajnAnI any more. It is only one who knows 
saguNa brahman who attains that world. The ajnAnI who has desires, for juicy 
jalebis or anything else, is in some place where he requires effort to 
attain them. The liberated soul who attains all desires effortlessly, 
through mere will, does not have the karma of return to saMsAra - anAvRttiS 
SabdAt.

But saMsAra is not your true nature. If you were never out of saMsAra, that 
means you have not realized your true nature, and are therefore ignorant of 
Brahman. If you have realized yourself, then there is no more saMsAra. 
Nowhere in advaita vedAnta is saMsAra said to be the nature of Brahman.
