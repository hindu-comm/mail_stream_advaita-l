I feel it is common to misunderstand the essential way of interpreting
advaita VedAnta at the philosophical level: the logical system used is
three-fold and not the regular two-fold kind.

In other words, there is Reality (Brahman), Unreality (saMsAra), and
the Neither-Reality-nor-Unreality (anirvachanIya avidyA). avidyA is
what makes the Unreality (saMsAra) appear as the Reality (Brahman), but
itself cannot be categorized as either.

All of the questions below seem to make the implicit assumption that it
is possible to fit advaita into the two-fold (Real-Unreal) logic
system, and simply shows that it is indeed impossible to fit advaita
into this mould. When this two-fold system of logic is renounced, the
questions answer themselves:

saMsAra is Brahman viewed through avidyA. Again, avidyA is not
categorized as either identical with Brahman nor different from it.

"Leaving saMsAra" raises fresh difficulties which are not encountered
when one speaks of "destruction of avidyA" instead.

Desire has its root in avidyA. Only through avidyA is the Self seen as
fulfilling its desires.
