No just because all that is not Brahman is maya doesn't mean all those
mayavi things are equal.  Vedas have a privileged place because they are
the means by which the sorrow of samsara can be transcended.  A jalebi
cannot.

One may ask why is it that the Vedas can provide knowledge to transcend
samsara and not a jalebi?  It is a matter of definition.  Veda is (amongst
other things) that which gives knowledge to transcend samsara.  A jalebi
is a fried sweet.  One may as well ask why is 7?

The jnani can ask this or a one of a billion other questions. He can enjoy
this or one of a billion other things.  So why are we focusing on this one
jalebi issue? To think about it in these particular terms is a limited
persons choice.  To an unlimited person unbound, infinite person it
wouldn't occur to think in these terms.

Ok but that applies to Brahman as a whole not this or that part of
Brahman.  By projecting forth, Brahman accepted limits and that limited
Brahman has to be analyzed in terms of the logic of limits.
