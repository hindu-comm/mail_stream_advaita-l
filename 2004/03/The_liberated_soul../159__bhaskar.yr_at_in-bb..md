I never talked about any jivas. It is the brahman who
desires to eat jalebis.

praNAms kiran prabhuji
Hare Krishna

In bruhadAraNyaka braman regarded as without taste, withoutsmell, It eats
nothing whatever, no one eats it!!  & in shwetAshwetara it says sarvEndriya
vivarjita.......braman's desire to eat jalebis??? Indeed  a strange
observation from shankara bhagavad pAda's desciple!!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
