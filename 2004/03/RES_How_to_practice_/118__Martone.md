Assunto: [Advaita-l] How to practice advaita?


I am interested in learning about "how to practice advaita philosophy" on a
day to day basis in the present day. Does it mean practicing yoga asanas,
meditation, and moderation in diet, exercise and sleep? Does it mean
constant contemplation and/or reflection on the question "who am I"? Does it
mean always alert, without desires and day dreams, living in the present
moment, being detached...?

Could the members of the list elaborate on what "practice" means for them,
and what is their concern about Ramakrishna ashram practice(s) - which I am
not familiar with.

Thanks.
Venkat Shrinivas
