Namaste.

Martone
"I would like also some directions about "how" to make the
self inquiry or
how to practice advaita. I read a lot of things but it
seems I couldn?t
understand yet how to start..can anyone help me ( us)?"

This link would also give you references to some other
posts regarding the subject. It would be worthwhile, from
the context of your question, to see them.
