Namaste.
I am replying to the following question of sister Asuman
Martone
"I would like also some directions about "how" to make the
self inquiry or
how to practice advaita. I read a lot of things but it
seems I couldn?t
understand yet how to start..can anyone help me ( us)?"

Namaste, Sister Martone and all,
Please see the following message of mine on the other list,
with the title Five tenets of practical advaita:

This link would also give you references to some other
posts regarding the subject. It would be worthwhile, from
the context of your question, to see them. 

PraNAms to all seekers of advaitic truth
