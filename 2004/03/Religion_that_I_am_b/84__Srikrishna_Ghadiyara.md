Is the intellectual and reasoning ability of those who
say 'stick to your own religion', unlimited ?

If you advocate so much that 'birth' into a specific
religious background is because of 'past deeds', why
can not you advocate that the tendency and interest to
choose a different religious practice is also because
of 'past deeds' ?

If one's 'past deeds' were so much binding and guiding
one, then one should have so chosen to 'stick' to
religion of birth all the time. But, it is not the
case.

Religion is 'man made'. No question of eligibility or
otherwise.

All philosophical speculation is intellectual. If not,
you can not endorse that 'advaita' is better than
'dvaita' etc. as many in this list believe.

In the process of evolution, comparison is a must.

When you agree that if I am 'destined to', then why
ifs and buts such as 'I strive with sincere effort'.
Who is propelling that 'effort' ? 

If one is 'destined' to change religion, one will
change. Why prescribe some rules about it ? and preach
them not to, unless one can agree that 'being
preached' and 'preaching' is one's destiny ?

So, being born into a religion is of no consequence
and 'past deeds' have no connection to 'enlightenment'
!! ??

Yes, everyone agrees that 'true enquiry' has no
requirement of any religion.

Such questions can only try to bring out the real
drive/reason for change. Change itself can not be
stopped. Sure one can study one's religious scripture.
If truth be the same every where then by changing
scripture, nothing is lost any way.

There is no-where to go. If that is the truth, then
any religion is the same. If one is driven to choose
some thing else, and it 'works out', it is not because
one wants it this way or that way, it has to be
accepted that it is the result of 'past deeds' as you
put it.

Let those who want to promote 'change', promote and
let those who want to 'prevent', prevent.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
