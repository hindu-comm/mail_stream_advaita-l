Namaste Sri Ganesh,

> The essence of advaita is packed in it and statements like atyatishta >dashangulam, nanya pantha ayanaye vidyate, tamasa parastat, >ajayamano bahudha vijayate are often quoted as sruthi pramana. We >shall probably discuss later about them. 

May I also add - "purusha evedaGM sarvam | yad bhUtam yac ca bhavyam |" to the list of statements with advaita packed in them.  I hope we discuss these sooner for I am eager to learn.

Thanks and Regards
Raghavendra
