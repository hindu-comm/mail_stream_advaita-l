HI Taina

I feel a little as you do..I was born in Brasil in a christian family, but
have experiecied many paths till now. I reverted to Islam about 5 years ago
but I love Vedanta very much too, specially Sankaraacharya and Sri Ramana
Maharshi.
I don?t see real conflits between my two loved spiritual practices, besides
what I call "interpretations" of this or that teaching and so I go on with
both, wanting to go deeply in Vedanta.
I do believe the religion is that one you feel atracted by your heart and
not the one you were born with.

Best regardings
Cecilia, from Brasil

Assunto: Re: [Advaita-l] the religion i am born into




Dear members,

It was interesting to read comments to this letter. I have sometimes
thought why I am so interested about Hindu teachings (expecially
advaita-teachings and Sri Ramana Maharshi teachings) although I leave
North Finland in middle of cristianity.

I have grown up cristianity atmosphere although in my family had not
interest religional things, only at school I learned something about
cristianity. So when I was about 12 years old I was nearest atheist, I
believed and thought that different religions are due of aliens ancient
visits to this planet.

This interesting got me find religionar books that I could find
"evidents" about aliens visits, so I read little Bibble I thought
"angels" are humanoids etc. Then I find little artickle from
Mahabharata, from which I also tried find evident about aliens.

But this finding of religional books leaded me to write book Story of
Krishna which did strong influence to me and so I got firsdt contact to
Hindu teachings. Some After that I read article about hindu religion
which handled statement Nirvana. This also did strong influence to me,
somehow I imaged that Nirvana is somekind "empty" state in which have no
any experiences, this made me feel in this way, "I don't ever want to
attain Nirvana because I want to enjoy life, experience things, born
again and again and experience. Although I thought in this way I thought
and thought statement Nirvana, I imaget it is somekind place in "space",
I imaged it is somehow inside dark empty space but sametime there can
"see" space around it. This strong experience left inside me and after
years when I read first time about Sri Ramanas discussion between Paul
Brunton and Sri Ramana Maharshi I just knew "This is just for me" this
is what I seeked all of my life from my childhood. This felt so clear
and sure and after that I have somekind inner feeling hindu and advaita
teachings are just to me.

I think this is dueing of my past interestings, maybe I have been
devotee of Krishna or Rama or Sri Ramana Maharshi because I feel very
big love toward them, somehow I miss them so much that I have no words
to image this..

I want to say with this writing that although one may live different
circumstations even in atheist circumstations somehow hidden vasanas
lead you into path in which you have been earlier. This inner "power"
get you burst through big obstackles, somehow you know inside yourself
what is just for you. So I lived no-religional circumstations only
learned little christianity in school and without believing christianity
in my childhood only thinking scientic reasons and that "aliens" are
reason for religions. In these times I didn't anybody about
Hindu-scriptures and however, itself without anykind conversion from any
direction I found hindu-teachings just to me. I think this is just due
of karma, therefore althoug you are born into some religion you can
convert itself into some other religion.
