Subject: Advaita-l Digest, Vol 11, Issue 2
Purushasuktham
This is a ‘sthuthi’- which means ‘in praise of’. We have many slokas written in praise of various deities by many acharyas but this suktha has its origin in the Vedas itself like few other sukthas. It is basically a rik but found in other Vedas also. ‘sushtu uktham iti suktham’, hence purushasuktham is in praise of the ‘purusha’. Who is this purusha? Two popular meanings are given, ‘sarvam poorayathi iti prushah’- the one who fills up everything or the all-pervading. It can also mean ‘purah nivasathi or thishtathi’- the indweller of all beings, the one inside all- the consciousness or athma. Hence purushasuktha is in praise of Brahman or athma. We get two benefits by chanting or studying this, the commonly chanted version gives ‘punya’ hence chitha shudhi and later we get the ultimate purpose by understanding its real meaning and that is to ‘gain’ moksha. Any mantra is ‘mananath trayathe iti mantra’- it protects us by giving knowledge.

Lord’s praise is always two folded. Any praise has to be comparitive, hence a standpoint is needed. One is from his swaroopam or absolute standpoint and the other is from his mahima or greatness as Iswara. When we give great attributes to lord we actually bring him down from his absolute swaroopam and that is why it is said ‘God defined is god defiled’. Human nature is to glorify oneself but the Sastra draws our attention to the fact that all our glories are not truly ours but belongs to that one Iswara. To understand this is not easy because we always see ourself as different from god. If my glory has to be seen as that of god’s it must have a basis, without which we cannot accept this idea. Self adoration is common and is attributed to ahamkara or ego and that is why when we come to sastra, be it Bakthi or Vedanta- we bring in a principle of surrender or saranagathi. The most important surrender of all is giving up of the ego—Infact this is the true surrender, every other 
surrender is for namesake only. The ‘karta bhavam’ has to go, which happens only when we understand ‘Ekasya bhavam’ and realize the nonexistence of the ego. This knowledge has to be clear for it to transform our lives, as we have to deal with ahamkara daily. Without this understanding vedantic study will remain academic. There is no Moksha without Ahamkara nivrithy. Purushah alone is everywhere including all bodies.
Purusasuktha deals with the praise of the lord in both aspects-the relative and the absolute. The essence of advaita is packed in it and statements like ‘atyatishta dashangulam’, ‘nanya pantha ayanaye vidyate’, ‘tamasa parastat’, ‘ajayamano bahudha vijayate’ are often quoted as sruthi pramana. We shall probably discuss later about them.

> Of these, the four names ?ayodhyA?, ?dhArA? (Bhoja?s
> capital), ?madhurA?, ?avantI? (Ujjain) are well known as
> the names of cities. 
> ?VishAlA?  (coming at the beginning of the verse) is also

> slogan-cry of devotees: ?Jai bhadri-vishAl?!  In the
> Valmiki Ramayana when Rama and Lakshmana are taken by
> Vishvamitra to Mithila, on the way they pass through the
> city of ?VishAlA?. 
> In the Kannada region, there is a ?KalyANi? in  the
> district of Bidar. In the days of the Acharya that region
> was called ?Kuntala?, with its capital at Kalyani. In later
> days when the Chalukya dynasty of Vatapi came to an end,
> but again emerged as a powerful influence, it came to be
> known as the ?Kalyani Chalukya dynasty?.
> 
> BogavatI is another city. This is known as ?kambath? in
> Gujarat. The Englishmen called it Cambay. That is why the
> name of ?Gulf of Cambay? came up. 
> VijayA is another city. It is not the Vijayanagar of Hampi
> in Bellary District of Karnataka. Nor is it the
> Vijayanagaram of Srikakulam District of Andhra, where the
> famous Gajapati kings ruled.  In order to distinguish these
> two Vijayanagara?s, the Hampi Vijayanagara was called
> ?Vijaya? and the Andhra Vijayanagara was called ?Viziya? by
> later English Historians. It was the Hampi Vijayanagara
> that became the seat of the famous Vijayanagara Empire in
> later days; because the city was named ?VidyA-nagara? by
> Bhukkaraya. But that was in the 14th century. Neither this
> nor the Andhra Viziya was there at the time of the Acharya.
> So the ?Vijaya? that he has immortalised in this verse must
> be something else, probably the Kurukshetra of the
> Mahabharata. The last shloka of the Gita says: ?Where there

> be this Vijaya is referring to Kurukshetra. It is
> interesting to note that Arjuna was himself also known as
> ?Vijaya?.

> These eight cities are not ordinary places. The
> relationship of ambaaL to them all is because of the fact
> that Her  eye-glance  (dRshhTi) while falling on  the
> entire universe  fell in addition with an extra force on

> characteristic of the dRshhTi of ambaaL. This is shown by
> the extra meaning imbedded in these words in addition to

> The Commentators wax eloquent on  the precise meanings of
> ?vishAlA dRshhTi?, kalyANI dRshhTi? and so on for all the
> eight epithets for the glance of ambaaL. I do not remember

> At this point,  Ra. Ganapathy, the writer of these records,

> ?Lakshmidhara?s bhashya on Soundaryalahari 
> describes these eight kinds of eye-glances thus. 
> ?vishAlA dRshhTi? shows an inner satisfaction. 
> ?kalyANI? shows the miraculous nature of the dRshhTi. 
> ?ayodhyA? is the smile shown by the very eyeballs. 
> ?dhArA? is that enchanting glance of the lover. 
> ?madhurA? is what is shown by contracted eyes. 
> ?bhogavatI? is the glance shown by friendly affection. 
> ?avantI? is the innocent look. 
> ?vijayA? is the side glance emanating from the position of 
> the eyeball moving to the extreme corner of the eye?.
> 
> The breadth of coverage of the glance of ambaal is vast and
> so it is vishAlA. It also generates auspiciousness for the
> whole world; so it is kalyANI. 
> Now let us come to ?ayodhyA?. This name could have come to
> the capital of the state ruled by the Ikshvaku kings by one
> of two reasons. Their headquarters must have been so well

> in what way  the name fits ambaal?s eye-glance?  First of

> with ?eyes? compares it with blue lilies.  Going one step
> higher, poetic licence even  plays havoc with the roles of
> ?upamAna? (example) and ?upameya? (that which is
> exemplified); thus they interchange the roles of ?upamAna?
> and ?upameya?.  In the current context, it is not uncommon
> to say ?the eyes which belittle the blue lilies?. And then
> one gets to be more aggressive and says ? in the war of
> comparison, the eyes are the winners over the blue lilies?.
> It is in this strain the Acharya says ?eyes which are
> invincible by the blue lilies?. And this invincibility is
> what is built into the word ?ayodhyA?!
> 
> It is ambaal?s eye-glance that bestows the rain of

> ?kRpA-dhArA AdhArA?, thereby doubling the use of the sound
> ?dhArA? which is the name of the famous capital of Bhoja.
> And does it not indicate also the generosity of King Bhoja
> whose awards  always  excelled in their profusion because
> they were always given with both hands rather than a single
> hand, thus doubling the size of the benefaction?
