Namaste,

Although I am not personally linked to organisations
some of us who contribute to the advaitin site, and
live near to London, have met up recently.
I live south of London and you are welcome to contact
me at:   
anirvacaniya at yahoo.com

I have similar interests to yourself, have a look at
my site www.nonameorform.co.uk if you want to know
more of these interests.

Best wishes

ken
