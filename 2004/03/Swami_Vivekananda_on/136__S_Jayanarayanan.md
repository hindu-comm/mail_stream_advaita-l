The following website gives a quote from Vivekananda about Shankara:

http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15042001/Art06.htm

"About the activities of Sankaracharya, even Vivekananda had observed:
'And, such was the heart of Sankara that he burnt to death lots of
Buddhist monks by defeating them in argument. What can you call such
action on Sankara's part except fanaticism.' (Complete works of Swami
Vivekananda, Vol. III, p. 118, Calcutta, 1997)."

Can someone verify if the above quote is correctly attributed? I find
it appalling that Vivekananda would say something to this effect about
a saint from his own religion. The quote is not even historically
factual, which makes it all the more shocking.
