I'm not surprised.  every single thing in that article was either a lie or
half-truth.  This whole episode should serve as a warning that we need to
learn more about history ourselves.  Just because someone has "Professor"
in front of their names doesn't mean they necessarily know what they are
talking about!

Btw, even with this proviso, the story is not historically accurate.
Buddhism was in decline in India long before Shankaracharya.

Legitimate scholars like these may say things that are flattering to us or
they may not.  We should learn what we can from them but be aware their
agenda is different from ours so they should not be relied upon for the
purposes of sadhana.
