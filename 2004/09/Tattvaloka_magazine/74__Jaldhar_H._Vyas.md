[I recently received the following message and thought it would be of
interest to list readers.  I usually read Tattvaloka at the library but
I've decided to support them by getting a subscription and I urge you to
do the same. -- Jaldhar]

Tattvãloka the international English monthly spiritual magazine of Sri
Sharada Peetham, Sringeri was founded by Sri Abhinava Vidyathirtha
Mahaswamigal, the 35th pontiff of Sringeri, to disseminate the real values
of life across the world.

Tattvãloka  is now in its 27th year of publication.

The articles in Tattvãloka cover the whole gamut of Indian heritage and
its hoary wisdom. Tattvãloka offers a wide range of topics catering to
readers at varying levels of spiritual awareness and attainment. The
recent topics include:

-         Brahmasutra Sankara Bhashya

-         Prapanchasara

-         Ashtavaktra Samhita

-         Srimad Bhagavatam

-         Mantra Pushpam

-         Taming of Garuda ( from the Puranas)

-         Children;s Section

-         Stree Sakti

The monthly message from His Holiness ( "Jagadguru Speaks") will be a
guiding light and motivator for the every one. The present pontiff Sri
Bharathi Tirtha Mahaswamigal is currently guiding us to new heights.
