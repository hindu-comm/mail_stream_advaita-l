the method of sandhyavandana also differs according to Vedic shakha.  You
should find a vidvan Guru of your shakha and learn it from him.  If you
are unable to do this it is better to not say it at all then say it
incorrectly.  You've had your yajnopavita right?  And at that time you
learnt Gayatri mantra so say 1 mala of that if all else fails.
