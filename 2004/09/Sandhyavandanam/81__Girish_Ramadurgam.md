Hi,

I am not sure if this is the right forum for this question and help that 
I require.

1) Whats the purpose of Sandhyavandanam? If its only to maintain 
discipline why is it said that "There is no fruit in Sandhyavandanam but 
if not done its a sin".
2) Whats wrong with our Society? Why do we have so many ways of doing 
Sandhyavandanam? Its different for Brahmin, Vysya and etc.
3) Help - I am in UK and I need a English version of Sandhyavandanam. 
Would anyone be able to help me with this.

I appreciate your response and help.

Kind Regard,
Girish
