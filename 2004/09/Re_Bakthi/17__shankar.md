Is not the visuals seen by the people
superficial ?.since on certain occasion
what we see might not be true.The people
who thought that the man is religious are commenting only on the dress,
probably the man could have worn this for a drama  and not for only puja.
Sometimes the same people
would think a siddhar ( a sort of enlightened
persons,as addressed in Tamil nadu) as a
mad man and equivate a mad man as a siddhar. These assumptions cannot be
always
construed as true and false.The exteriors
as seen of a person cannot be measured in a 1-10 bhakthi scale since as an
outsider we
cannot predict the levels of bhakthi achieved
by a bhaktha.This can be scaled only by  bhaghawan. As an outsider can we
predict
who between  "Meera" and "Surdas" where better bhaktas of Lord Krishna. Only
the lord
can know it, isn't it ?

People do judge a person and asertain that
he is a great bhaktha of so and so lord. But
the question is the sacle of greatness,  which
can be only assertained by the receiver of the
bakthi. The relationship is one to one and I
think only these two know how their
relationship is evolving. We may and can pass
judgement and why should we fear about it. This is in no way affecting them
since both are
not looking at us to measure.
