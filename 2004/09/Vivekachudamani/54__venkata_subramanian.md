For cross referencing any specific area, you may consult the English Translation of Sri Shankaranarayanan, published by Bharathiya Vidya Bhavan.   The translation is that of the Sanskrit Commentary by H.H. Sri Chandrashekhara Bharathi Jagadguru of Sringeri.

The book by Swami Chinmayananda is very good. If I remember, it had the text
in sanskrit with a translation followed by the commentary/interpretation by
Swamiji. The Swamiji tries to explain the concepts in simple and easy to
understand method. I found this book to be more useful for a lay person than
any scholarly translation.
