hariH Om !!

It is my opinion that the commentary of Swami
Chinmayananda does not go well. It is verbose and not
on the point most of the time. I would prefer the book
by Swami Madhavananda, published by Sri Ramakrishna
Mission. In that book exact meaning of the sloka is
given without any unnecessary explanation; relevant
notes is provided.

I understand that in some recent evaluation done by
Kanchi Matha, they opined that the Vicekacudamani
translation into Telugu published by Sri Vyasasramam,
Yerpedu, (near Tirupati), translated by Sri
Sivacharanam was the best. I have personally read this
book, and I am extremely happy. If one has a chance to
read both this book and Swami Chinmayananda's
commentary, my comments will become obviously clear to
you.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
