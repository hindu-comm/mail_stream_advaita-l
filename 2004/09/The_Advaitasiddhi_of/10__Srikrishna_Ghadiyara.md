hariH Om !!

I have the book 'The Advaitasiddhi of Madhusudan
Saraswati' English translation by Ganganath Jha,
published bu Sri Satguru Publications, pages 327

I notice that on all the pages in  the book, it reads
Chapter 1 - Unreality. The same is mentioned along
with the title on the inside first page.

Would someone clarify to me how many chapters comprise
the original Advaita Siddhi and what are the topics.
Are there are other published translations of Jha or
other writers with other chapters ? Someone mentioned
earlier that the book by Nair (Critical study .. , was
not good enough).

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
