hariH Om !!

Thank you for the information.

Considering the fact that Sri Ganganatha Jha has
already written a translation for the first chapter,
you should start from chapter 2. That way the complete
book may be made accessible for the public at the
earliest. That will serve the purpose better.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
