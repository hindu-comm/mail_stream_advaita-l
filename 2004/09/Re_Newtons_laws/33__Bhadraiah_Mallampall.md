>>It is proved that Gaudapaada knew a more generic form of Newton's laws at

Apologies for my provocative wording. That was not meant to understate 
Gaudapada's teaching.
My intention was to state that Acharya's teachings were capable of 
explaining the jagat, otherwise BTW how could the teachings help us to get 
rid of it?

I think it is a good habit. You should read Douglas Hofstadter's book 
"Godel, Escher, Bach". Hofstadter picks up ancient Greek stories and 
shamelessly reads all kinds of modern subjects like computer sciences, 
genetics, etc in them. The whole of western civilization adores his book 
which had won Pulitzer prize.

Considering that ancient Indian works are a million times more generic and 
deeper and you should re-evaluate your statement.

Newton's mathematics was mached by our mathematicians
from kerala and other places.

The last five centuries of colonialization destroyed our mathematics.
The divergence right started after birth of East India company.

BTW, the annam you get from Newton's laws is limited.
The annam derived from asparsha yoga is limitless.

Best regards
Bhadraiah
