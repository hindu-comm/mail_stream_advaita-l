Here for example is the description in Vishnu Purana 5.37

Then Bhagavan having joined his own self with the self which is Brahman
inexhaustible, inconceivable and one with Vasudeva, the pure, unborn,
unaging, imperishable and universal Self,  abandoned his mortal body and the
existence consisting of three gunas.


So "death" is not explicitly mentioned here at least but leaving the
mortal body is close enough I think.  It seems overly pedantic to use
appearence and disappearence instead.  And note Bhagavans true nature is
said to be nirguna.
