Dear List members,

The following web-site may be of interest:

http://www.srisharada.com/SharadaPeetam.html

It has a link to stotras composed by Sri Bharati Tirtha Swamigal, the
translation (of many of the chapters) of the commentary on the
Vivekacudamani by Sri Candrasekhara Bharati Swamigal. There is also a
section from a book on Vidyaranya published by the Sringeri Mutt.

There is also a link to many nice photographs. But it takes you to a
web-site where you have to register. A minor annoyance, but worth it.

Rama
