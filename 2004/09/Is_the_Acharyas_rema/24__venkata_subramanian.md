Please refer Mundaka Bhashya 2-2-7.

Ya Sarvajna Sarvavid Asyeisha Mahima Bhuvi.......

while explaining what this Mahima is -  The Acharya mentions this.

He says...the Earth is static and the sun and the moon revolve around it .....etc etc.....

all others are ok.  but how come the statement of the erstwhile Geocentric theory.

regards,
Venkat

Where exactly in Mundakopanishadbhashya does he say this? A cursory check
did not reveal it.
