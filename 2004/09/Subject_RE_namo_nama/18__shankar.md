Is not the visuals seen by the people superficial ?.since on certain 
occasion what we see might not be true.The people who thought that 
the man is religious are commenting only on the dress,probably the
man could have worn this for a participating in a drama  and not for only puja.
Sometimes the same people would think a siddhar ( a sort of enlightened
persons,as addressed in Tamil nadu) as a mad man and equivate
a mad man as a siddhar. These assumptions cannot be always
construed as true and false.The exteriors as seen of a person cannot 
be measured in a 1-10 bhakthi scale since as an outsider we
cannot predict the levels of bhakthi achieved by a bhaktha.
This can be scaled only by  bhaghawan. As an outsider can we
predict who between  "Meera" and "Surdas" where better bhaktas 
of Lord Krishna. Only the lord can know it, isn't it ?

People do judge a person and asertain that he is a great bhaktha of so
and so lord. But the question is the sacle of greatness,  which
can be only assertained by the receiver of the bakthi. The relationship 
is one to one and I think only these two know how their
relationship is evolving. We may and can pass judgement and
why should we fear about it. This is in no way affecting them
since both are not looking at us to measure.

Shankar.
