The research was conducted by Swami Gyananand Saraswati, affiliated
with the "Adi Jagatguru Shankaracharya Sodh Sansthan" -- which sounds
definitely like an advaita institution. And the Swamiji uses verses
from scripture to arrive at conclusions regarding Krishna's life. Just
as Krishna's appearance is known by his "birth-date" (and celebrated as
GokulaashhTami), I don't see why his disappearance can also not be
known by his "death-date".

I'm not sure what exactly you are objecting to, and in fact I find your
objection itself to be offensive, in the light of your stating your own
opinions against a Swamiji who is directly quoting scripture. I think
you're trying to view advaita through "ISKCON-tinted glasses", which is
certain to result in misunderstanding.
