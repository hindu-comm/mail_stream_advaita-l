Hi,
Here's a brief introduction of myself:

My name is Ravi Parimi. I am working as a software engineer in Califronia,
USA. I am very intresed in the vedas and am currently learning suktams
etc. from a vedic priest. Ideally, I would like to learn the Krishna Yajur
vedam and also be able to do ghanapatham. I watched Sri Adi Shankara's
movie recently and found it very enlightening. I would like to learn more
about vedanta, advaita and the vedic philosophy in general.

On the broader side, I believe in leading an austere life, practising
renunciation and helping mankind. I hope this list helps in inreasing my
knowledge of advaita.

Regards,
--ravi
