General rule of thumb when it comes to vaidIka karmA - those performed with 
respect to ancestors (pitR karmA) are observed with greater strictures than 
those performed with respect to the gods (deva karma). Also, nityakarmA-s, 
those that are performed everyday, tend to be simpler, while those that are 
occasional (naimittika karmA-s) tend to be more elaborate. Those that are 
once in a lifetime events, e.g. birth-related, marriage-related and 
funeral-related, are typically even more elaborate.

Given these conditions, the level of attention to detail is still relatively 
the same, if we are to do these karmA-s properly. That people approximate 
and often shortchange the daily sandhyAvandana is not a property of the 
sandhyAvandana. It is a fault of those who do it that way.

There isn't. If we ask why, the answer is in the language usage itself. In 
English, we say "anything that we do". The verb there is "do", for which the 
Sanskrit verbal root is "kR", from which we derive the noun karmA. The 
simplest English translation for the word karmA is "action". Anything that 
we do is necessarily karmA. The only thing that is not karmA is pure being 
(we can put a capital B (Being) if we want, here).
