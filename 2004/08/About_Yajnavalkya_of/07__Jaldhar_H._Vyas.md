As Ranjeet mentioned, there were multiple kings named Janaka.  This is
from Vishnu or Matsya purana I think.

Yes.  This is true, the editor of the shatapathabrahmana copy I have
explains is by suggesting there are two lines of succession, a brahmAmnAya
and a suryAmnAya both of which were joined by Yajnavalkya

A contemporary exponent of shuklayajurvedic tradition (our mandirs' priest
who studied at H.H. Jagadguru Shankaracharya of Dwarkas' pathashala.)
seems to think so.  Most of the ancient commentators haven't really
bothered saying much about the vamshabrahmanas.

In the course of a modest amount of research into the subject, I've not
come up with a source that suggests there was more than one Yajnavalkya.
Janaka on the other hand...
