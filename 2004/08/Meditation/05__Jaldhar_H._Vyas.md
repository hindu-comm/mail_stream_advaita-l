Atma vichara, the contemplation of the question "who am I?" is all the
meditation you need.

The same as with any kind of Advaitic sadhana.  The point of Advaita
Vedanta is to realize the oneness of your own self with everything.  So
the only type of meditation which is relevant is the one which leads to
this goal.

Jnana and jnana only.  The "inner peace" etc. touted by a lot of yoga
teachers is at best a useful side effect.
