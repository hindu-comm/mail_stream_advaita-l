Shri Balaji Krishnapuram,

1. That Brahman can not be realized & that Brahman should be realized:

The only way to arrive at an answer seems to be - to work on this 
contradiction and never lose sight of it. Taking sides on this issue is to 
lull oneself into ignorance.

2. Is meditation (dhyaana) helpful or necessary for realization; or is 
dhyaana irrelevant?

The answer seems be : Neither. Ref. Ch.U. chapter 7, dhyaana is one of the 
many stages before realization, like egg is a stage before chicken. dhyaana 
will happen before realization (if we are lucky).

Best Regards
Bhadraiah
