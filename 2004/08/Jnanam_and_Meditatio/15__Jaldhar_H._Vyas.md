It is known through negative means.  When the false or rather
misunderstood (mithya) thoughts have been eliminated, the pure
consciousness alone remains.

This illustrates a difference between Advaita Vedanta and some of the
other philosophical currents in Indian thought.

Buddhism for example (at least the idealist types) considers the
elimination of false concepts to go to the ultimate extreme, the "snuffing
out" (nirvana) of the idea of self.

Samkhya/Yoga thinks the best that can be done is a kind of stasis
(samadhi) in which self and non-self are seperate.

Advaita Vedanta tries to make the self "full" (purna) by expanding it from
the limited notion of ego (ahamkara) to cover everything.  This is why it
is wrong to translate maya as "illusion" it is avidya (ignorance) which
cause that which is real to be thought as seperate when it is actually
ones own self.

No it cannot.  And you are right that meditation is lumped together with
karma not jnana by Advaitins.

"Experience of Brahman" suggests a duality between seer and seen.  This is
in keeping with the dualistic philosophy of classical samkhya/yoga which
originated the terminology of e.g. samadhi etc.  As I mentioned above the
goal of samkhya/yoga is for the purusha (soul) to be nothing more than an
eternal independent witness to prakrti (nature.)

jnana in advaita vedanta has an experiental side too, but it is Brahman
doing the experiencing, it is Brahman who is the experience.

An Advaitin would reply that the important thing is not the experience of
the taste, but the knowledge that sugar and tongue are one and the same.

Yes.  One should believe that Brahman is absent and we are trying to find
it.  Rather that all those every day experiences which we mistakenly
thought were not Brahman were in fact Brahman.

Exactly.
