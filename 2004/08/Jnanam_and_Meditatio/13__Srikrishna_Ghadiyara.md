Yes, the Knower can be known. It is by the Knower that
the Knower can be known.

The Knower knows that He/She/It knows, just as I know
that I know.

Brahman/Atma is svayam jyotiH. It is svayam pramana.
In that sense it is neither Knower nor Known. It is
Knowledge.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
