advaita-vedanta.org was unavailable from thursday night through Friday as
my ISP had to move the server it is located on and thus its' IP address
changed.  By now everything should be ok but if you are having problems
posting, try the following test:

>From a command line (Unix/Linux) or DOS prompt (windows) type

nslookup advaita-vedanta.org

If it returns, 216.162.42.100, you have the old IP address cached.  Just
wait a day or two and it should update itself.  If it doesn't consult your
ISP.  There is nothing I or this list can do about it.

If it returns, 66.164.225.100, you have the new address and things should
be ok.
