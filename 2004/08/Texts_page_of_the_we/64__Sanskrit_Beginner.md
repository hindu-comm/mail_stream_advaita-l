Namo Namah:
 For a site with a good purpose such as this, I find that 
other than the pages by Vidhyashankar, there is little 
information of the texts that a new comer should perhaps focus 
on.
 Not a complaint, but a general observation: the texts link 
from the home page just lists a few titles. 
 Given that I am a level 101 student, who has merely learned 
some words here are there out of random discussions/readings, 
where do I start, either validating my knowledge, or progress 
without holding down the crowd?
 Any list of books that are maintained elsewhere on the web?

Dhanyavaadhah:
