tat-jnAH vedhasaH : The knowers of the Self
pashyanti : realise

brahma : Brahman

yAdrK yAvAn upAdhiH yathA tathA : according to the nature

Note 1: The object that is reflected remains as it is,
irrespective of the various reflections. So also the
Ultimate remains the same, irrespective of the 
multiplicities that we see.

Note 2. Recall Rg Veda X-177 here. The Acharya must have
given this shloka as a paraphrase of that famous rik. See
