Namaste.

I am a 44 year old son of Sri Vidhya upaasakas and was introduced to the
advaita-vedanta site by a friend. I am just a curious observer looking for
an opportunity to understand and widen my knowledge of teachings and
sampradayams - I'm afraid I don't see me contributing much by way of actual
participation in the list discussions.

I am thankful if given the opportunity to observe and learn. Warm regards.
Sincerely.
