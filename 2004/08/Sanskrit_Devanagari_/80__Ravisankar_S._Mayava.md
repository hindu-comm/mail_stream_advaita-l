I like the software Itranslator 2003. It uses unicode font and people should
be able to view files with fonts such as Arial Unicode etc. I dont use
linux, but if i am not mistaken Linux also has Unicode support. That way you
will have some degree of cross-platform support.

Other option is to use tools in http://bhashaindia.com/. There are other
options (not free) such as aksharamala software.


If you ask me, I would recommend Itranslator. It is easy to use, and the
font that comes with it has  good support for marking swara-s.
