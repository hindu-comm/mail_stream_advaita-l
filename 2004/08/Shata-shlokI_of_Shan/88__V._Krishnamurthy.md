(This Supreme Self  i.e., this parAtmA, -- of the previous
shloka) 
trividhaM : has three aspects
pUrNa-AtmA-anAtma-bhedAt : according to (its being) the
Full, the Self and the non-self;
iha : inasmuch as, they are
paraM : the unconditioned  Self,
anyat buddhy-avacchinnaM :  and next, that which is
conditioned by the intellect
tatra eva AbhAsa-mAtraM : and finally, that which is only a
reflection; 
iva : just as 
gaganaM :  space 
tri-prakAraM vibhAti : manifests in three ways, namely 
ambho-vacchinnaM : that which is occupied  by water (in a
vessel)
asmin jale prati-phalitaM : that which is reflected in 
that water, 
ataH : and further,
pAthasaH antar-bahish-ca : the space which is inside and
outside (the vessel).
pUrNa-avacchinna-yoge : When the conditioned Self merges in
the unconditioned,
avidyA : the Ignorance 
layaM vrajati : disappears
svakAryaiH saha eva : along with all its effects.


Note 1. See the three facets of The Self in 
 http://www.geocities.com/profvk/TheSelf.html.
Therein  along with these three,  the outer self, which
is the body-mind-intellect, is also shown. The jIva which
is the reflection of the Ultimate in the intellect, is
usually mistaken as the self. When it is so mistaken it is
the non-self of this shloka. This is the space that is
reflected in water. The real self is the AtmA (the jIvAtmA)
which is the sAkshhI, corresponding to the space inside the
vessel, that is hidden or covered by water. And then there
is the pUrNAtmA which is the space everywhere including the
inside of the vessel.

PraNAms to all students of Adi Shankaracharya.
