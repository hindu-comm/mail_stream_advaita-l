yaH satvAkAra-vRttau : From such realisation of the Truth
pratiphalati :  (what) results (is that)
yuvA prANaH AvirbabhUva : a buoyant youthful life springs
up
deha-mAtrAvRtaH api : (which) though encased in a body (and
the senses) 
anupahataH : is unaffected 
taddharmaiH : by their natural attributes
bAlya-vArddhyAdibhiH : belonging to boyhood, old age and
the like.
shreyAn : It is full of bliss;
sAdhyaH : It can accomplish (great things).
sunipuNa-matayaH : Men of supreme wisdom
satya-sankalpa-bhAjaH : whose resolution is unfailing
devayantaH : and those who seek to become divine
abhyAsAt : by (spiritual) practice
nayanti hi : lead indeed 
tam etam : such a life
UrdhvaM : (to) the highest goal
pariNata-manasA sAkaM : along with the purified mind.

Note 1: yaH satvAkAra-vRttau : Recall the Acharya was
talking about jIvan-mukti in the previous shloka #44.

Note 2:  (VKs doubt): Who is leading whom here? Supremely
wise men and unfailingly resolute spiritual people help the
jIvan-muktas life to go along smoothly towards its natural
end. Is this what is being said?   [I am not happy at this
conclusion!  VK]

prAyaH : Mostly
tadA asau : then, this person
akAmaH :   (now) almost without desire,
astakAmaH: his desires having disaappeared,
AtmakAmaH : longs only for the Self
niratishaya-sukhAya : for the sake of its unsurpassed
bliss.
tat-prAptau : When That is obtained
Apta-kAmaH : all his desires have been attained
Sthita-carama-dashaH : and he remains in that final
condition.
deha-avasAne : When the body dies,
prANAH : the life-forces
na eva utkramanti : do not rise therefrom (for any future
birth)
krama-viratimitAH : but gradually dissolve themselves 
sva-sva-hetau : in their respective sources 
tadAnIM : And then,
kva ayaM jIvaH : where is this individual soul
vilInaH : having been dissolved
lavaNam iva jale : like salt in water?
pashcAt : Thereafter, 
akhaNDa Atma eva : it is nothing but the Infinite Self
itself!

Note: These two shlokas (#s45 and 46) are relevant in the
context of standard questions like What happens to a
jIvan-mukta in his life as a jIvan-mukta?.  

PraNAms to all students of Adi Shankaracharya.
