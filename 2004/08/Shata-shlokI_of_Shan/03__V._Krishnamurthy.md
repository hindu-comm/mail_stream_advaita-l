unmUlya : Having rooted out
sarvAn kAmAn : all desires
hRdi kRta-nilayAN : which have taken their seats in the
heart
uccaiH kshhipta-shankUn iva : as if their pegs were
forcibly broken,
tIrNa-dehAbhimAnaH : having crossesd all attachment with
the body
Atma-dattAbhimAnaH : and having given all his attention to
the Self
tyajati : He abandons
capalatAM : waywardness.
kRta-sukRta-bharaH : Full of accumulated merit 
yAti : he reaches
UrdhvasthAnaM uccaiH : the highest abode (sahasrAra cakra)
vicitraM : that is adorned by 
nIlash-ceta-aruNAbhiH nADikAbhiH : dark, white and red
nADIs 
sravad-amRta-bharaM : full of flowing nectar
gRhyamANAtma-soukhyaH : (and thereby is) the enjoyer of the
bliss of the Self.

Note the words uccaiH kshhipta-shankUn iva. He tells us
how to root out the desires. They are pegged into us
without our knowing it. The pegs have to be forcibly pulled
out.

Note: Who is speaking this verse? Ramana or Shankara? Does
this not look like a first person account of the Acharya
Himself?

PraNAms to all students of Adi Shankaracharya.
