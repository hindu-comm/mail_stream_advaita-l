yat-kimcin-nAma-rUpAtmakam-idam-asad-evo-ditaM bhAti bhUmau
yenA-neka-prakArair-vyvaharati jagad-yena tene-shvareNa /
tadvat-pracchAdanIyaM nibhRta-rashanayA yadvad-eshha
dvi-jihvaH
tena tyaktena bhojyaM sukham-anatishayaM mA
grdhonyad-dhanAdyaM //

yat kimcit:  Whatever  (is)
nAma-rUpAtmakaM  idaM : of the nature of name and form here
bhUmau : in this world
asat eva uditaM : springs up as a mere unreality
pracchAdanIyaM :  (and) should be veiled off
tena IshvareNa : by that Lord
yena jagat bhAti : by whom this universe is manifest
yena aneka-prakAraiH vyvavaharati : (and) by whom it is
multifariously active;
yadvat tadvat : just as 
eshhaH dvijihvaH : this snake (is veiled off)
nibhRta-rashanayA : by the known rope.
tena tyaktena : Only by abandoning that (unreality)
anatishayaM sukhaM bhojyaM : unsurpassed bliss is to be
enjoyed
mA gRdhaH anyat dhana-AdyaM : Do not covet anything else
like wealth, etc.

Note 1. I have translated rashanA as rope. It is only a
guess. I dont have dictionary support for this. Can some
one help?

Note 2. Readers would easily recognize that this shloka is
a paraphrase, -- with the Acharyas stamp
nibhRta-rashanayA yadvad-eshha dvijihvaH --  of the first
verse of Ishopanishat. Mark how dexterously he uses the
same words Isha (IshvareNa), vAsyaM (pracchAdanIyaM),
idaM, yat kimca, jagat, tena tyaktena bhunjIta
(bhojyam) , mA gRdhaH , dhanaM !
