Far greater misinterpretations are possible even in those statements which are grammatically "satisfying".  Meanings are missed not so much in which word/declension/tense/mood it is, but rather in what it means.  Different meanings are possible even in those statements whose grammatical/syntactical rectitude is universally agreed upon.
