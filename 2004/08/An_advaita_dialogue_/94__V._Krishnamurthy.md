Namaste.

The concluding instalment of advaita dialogue containing 
entries 801-1008 may now be viewed at 

http://www.geocities.com/profvk/advaitadialoguepage5.html

My PraNAms to all the great gurus of the world and to the
Guru of all Gurus, Shri dakshiNAmUrti.

V. Krishnamurthy

P.S. Now that the entire document is before you, may I
request readers to let me know whether there is any error
of one or more of the following kinds:
1. I may have committed a blatant error from the normally
accepted advaita teaching;
2. I may have been very vague ; and 
3. I might have added confusion to an already complicated
issue.
Thanks and PraNAms to all advaitins.
