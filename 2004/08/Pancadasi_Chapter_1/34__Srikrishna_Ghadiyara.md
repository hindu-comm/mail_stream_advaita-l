hariH Om !!

The book published by Chinmaya Mission, once upon a
time, was by Swami Anubhavananda. Now that he is no
longer with Chinmaya Mission and runs his own asram,
those 5 Vols publication is not sold any more at
Chinmaya Mission. However you can get it from
http://www.2bblissful.com/ You can call Umesh Reghuram
at 510 - 754 2799 and you should get a copy from him.

I have listened to Swami A, and I guess these are not
the books you will benefit most. I guess, these books
will be verbose. I have not read these books
personally, though I have them. But, it is my opinion
that you will not get accurate Vedanta thought in
those books. He will mix Yoga and other khichidi. It
may give you compilation from several of his readings.
Personally, I would prefer to read from a better
author.

The Ramakrishna Mission publication by Swami
Swahananda may be OK. It is concise. But, as the
author himself clarifies, he does not stick strictly
to word meaning. But, gives a free hand translation.
But, in my opinion I need a better book than that.

You can also look for a book by Sri H. P. Shastri, at
http://www.shanti-sadan.org/index.htm I have not read
this book either. 

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
