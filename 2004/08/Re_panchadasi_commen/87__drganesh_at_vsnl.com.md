Subject: [Advaita-l] Pancadasi , Chapter 1
Would you please tell me where can I find a
good commentary on Pancadasi , Chapter 1.

I am not looking for  word-to-word meaning.

I am more looking for a commentary on Chapter 1 of Pancadasi in English.

Thank you
Regards

I will recommend swami dayanand saraswathi's commentaries which can be obtained from arshavidya.org or from sastraprakasika.org. 
Swami paramarthananda's detailed commentary on the first ten chapters can be obtained from www.yogamalika.org. I immensly benefitted from them and will strongly recommend it.you can see it in the catalogue section of the yogamalika site.
