hariH Om !!

I recently read the book titled, 'Meditation in
Sankara's Vedanta' by Jonathan Bader, published by
Aditya Prakashan, New Delhi Rs. 150.

Meditation is one of the most important topics a
spiritual seeker has to be clear about. Also, if one
is a student of Vedanta, and trust that the path laid
out by Sankara should suffice to reach the ultimate
goal of this seeking, one should clearly know what
meditation is as per Sankara. This book will be useful
to remove mis-conceptions and set one on the right
path. Given below is my review of the book.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
