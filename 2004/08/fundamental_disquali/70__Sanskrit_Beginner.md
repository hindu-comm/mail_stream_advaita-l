Namo namah:

 Thanks to all who responded.
 I did get a few mails that I was not polite or was 
offensive. My public apologies. I was merely voicing my 
thoughts as they came, and no offence is/was intended. I 
promise to be more thoughtful and word it better next time.

 Thanks for the explanation. I guess what this is asking for 
is more a form of commitment to the process to (or intention 
to) cleanse oneself and prepare oneself? If so, gives a 
little bit of comfort on one hand to feel that one is not 
totally abandoned. Yet, it raises some unsettling other 
thoughts, in the sense, if even the first sentence needs help 
with interpretation to understand, progress would be slow. If 
I were to perhaps raise questions on this list, I hope I 
would be pardoned if the members feel it is regurgitation or 
too simple ....
 References to Swami Vivekananda's talk would be help ful. I 
have found his English and writing approach have been 
excellent!

 Will do, thanks.

 My apologies. Will adibe by it.
