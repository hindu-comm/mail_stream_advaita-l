Dear Sanskrit Beginner,

The thoughts that appear to distract a beginner (or even an expert) are also 
a manifestation of the material you want to meditate on. When this is 
realized there is no paradox... unless ofcourse one believes in really 
incorrigible bad guys like a Satan different from a God.

Best Regards
Bhadraiah
