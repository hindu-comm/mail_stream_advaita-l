Upto a point.  Because the truth is in the end we do believe in authority
-- of the Vedas, shastras, and tradition.  So this places a boundary.  But
within that boundary, there is nothing wrong with enquiry

No karma is not like that.  It is cause and effect.  Every cause has some
effect which in turn causes more actions.  You cannot "eat till you are
full"  The only way to break the cycle is to not act and reduce your
desire to act.

Presumably the difference is that karma is done for selfish reasons (fear
that bad things, might happen, desire for earthly or heavenly reward etc.)
Whereas upasana (meditation) is done presumably for higher goals.  But
meditation is indeed a type of karma.

Yes.
