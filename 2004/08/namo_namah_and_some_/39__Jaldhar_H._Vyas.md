We had a discussion a while back about the verses of the Gita where the
three types of bhakti are described.

When one worships out of fear that God will do bad things to you if you
don't that is the worst, tamasika kind of bhakti.

When one worships as a kind of bargain that if you do good things for God,
he will do things for you in return such as give wealth, heaven etc. that
is middling rajasika bhakti.

when one worships purely out of a sense of duty and love of God without
caring about the results that is Sattvika Bhakti.

And when one realizes that the Lord the self of all pervades ones own self
that is jnana which is the highest bhakti.

The internet is good for factual information (and that not all the time!)
it is not a substitute for satsang.  as for how impossible satang may be,
it depends on how badly you want it.

Both karma and jnana are ultimately about bhakti.  This is why there is
no seperate bhaktikanda to the shastras like karmakanda and jnanakanda.
Bhakti is about your attitude to karma and jnana really.
