namasthe,

    Please take a look at the following site and I was fortunate to watch this video two days ago. It is a stunning animation presentation on spiritual journey running for 60 minutes. The presentation is of very high quality in terms of spiritual content, the  background music and narration.

  Though its not purely vedanta related, it addresses a lot of questions of every spiritual sadhaka.
