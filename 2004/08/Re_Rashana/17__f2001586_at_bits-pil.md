Namaste,

I have come across the word razana in the last dazaka of the 
naaraayaNiiyam. In the kezaadi paadaanta varNanam, Bhattathri refers to 
kRSNa's kaTisuutra (piece of rope tied around the waist) as diipta razmi 
sphuTa maNi razanaa kiGkiNii maNDitam....

Of course, prof vk must be well acquainted with this reference. Just 
thought this would help.

Ganesh
