Hello,

I was raised in the United States;  my parents are from India;  and the
family tree has its root in Tamil Nadu.  My interest in advaita-vedAnta
was kindled by independent reading and the teaching at Arsha Vidya
Gurukulum (www.arshavidya.org) and Arsha Bodha Center
(www.arshabodha.org).

With best regards,

Kumar
