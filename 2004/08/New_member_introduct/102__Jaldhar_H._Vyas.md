Namasthe,

I am Shankar from Bangalore..I am interested to know
about Advaitha vedantha..I am a regular visitor to
Sringeri and i am quite interested in Advaitha after
reading the book "Dialogues with The Guru" in which
Swamy Chandrashekarabharathi talks about it..
Please provide me an oppurtunity to be part of the
group and understand Advaitha to whatever extent i
can..

Regards,
Shankar
