Greetings,
 I had learned of advaita from studying materials from
ISKCON. I figured that it is best to study this
philosophy from an original source than through
criticisms. I have been on this spiritual quest for
over 20 years and have read most of the major
scriptures of all the major religions. I come here
hoping to be further inspired.
