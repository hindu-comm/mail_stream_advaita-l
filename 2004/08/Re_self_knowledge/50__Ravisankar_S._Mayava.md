Of the four components that make antaHkaraNa, it is the ahaMkAra  or "the
sense of agency" that mixes up Atman and anAtman. This ahaMkAra is avidya.
manas, buddhi, and chitta are jaDa. But the words manas etc. are often used
interchangeably to denote all of antaHkaraNa.

Typically, the answer to the question "who is bound" is given as "whoever is
asking this question." One thing I found in advaita-vedAnta is, if try to go
quite deep into this matter you will have to always confront the
"anirvachaniiya" aspect of avidya. How the ahaMkAra started mixing up Atman
with anAtman  will point only to anAdi avidya, which is anirvachaniiya.
