speech is speech.  Even if it is not totally systemized it still follows
rules.  For example some English speakers use constructions like "ain't"
which are not grammatical but one can still understand what they mean.

Chandas are poetic meters.  As many of the Vedic mantras are metrical,
"chhandas" became a synonym

The science of vyakarana (grammar) arose in India precisely to safeguard
the meaning of the Vedas. (One of six vedangas,  chhanda shastra is
another.)  Panini, Katyayana, and Patanjali, took the Vedic and laukika
(everyday) language and made it "purified" or "perfected" (Samskrta) as
opposed to the "natural" (Prakrit) languages that became the ancestors of
our modern north Indian languages.

Yes, in places.  But most of it is pretty much the same as Sanskrit.

Paninis' sutras do note Vedic variations in many cases.  There were also
other grammatical works dealing exclusively with issues of Vedic language.
Still sometimes differences of interpretation have caused problems.  But
it is amazing to note that for a corpus of texts so ancient, how little
disagreement there is over its' meaning.
