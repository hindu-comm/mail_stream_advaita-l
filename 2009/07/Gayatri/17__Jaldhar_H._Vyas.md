Adhikara for brahma jignasa is based on dhI (intelligence), viveka 
(discrimination between real and unreal.) etc.  Even the staunchest 
orthodox person will acknowledge that non-dvijas are of the nature of 
Brahman and can and do possess such qualities.  The question of adhikara 
to recite vedanta vakyas is orthogonal.
