Group mates,

I am very new to Advaita-Vedanta.  I became interested after a sister of
mine sent me a book entitled the Power of Now, by Eckhart Tolle.  At the
time I was deeply depressed and suicidal, and found no respite via any
avenue.  Neither medicine, nor psychiatry nor psychology nor my practice of
Christianity helped.  Tolle's book, however lent some peace.  Since reading
his book, I have read two books by Dennis Waite.  The second being The Book
of One.  I am very new, but at peace at various depths for longer lengths of
clock time.  I no longer wish for annihilation, and have a general sense
that all is well. I do not belong to any study groups, nor do I sit under a
teacher.  At present this is all I can say.  I am very pleased to have the
opportunity to study this philosophy.

Presently, I work and reside in Phoenix-Arizona-USA.  I am 58 years old and
widowed.

I have no children.
