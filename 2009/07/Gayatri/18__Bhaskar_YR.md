Even the staunchest orthodox person will acknowledge that non-dvijas are 
of the nature of 
Brahman and can and do possess such qualities.  The question of adhikara 
to recite vedanta vakyas is orthogonal.

Thanks for your clarifications...Kindly bear with my fussy nature 
here..prabhuji.  Do you mean to say here those non-dvija-s who have enough 
dhi shakti & viveka to do brahma jignAsa can do so through smruti & purANa 
texts without taking the reference from  shruti-s/vedAnta??  Kindly let me 
know, whether this vedAdhikAra restricted to ONLY recitation of veda 
maNtra-s with 'svara-s' (intonations) or plain reading of the vedic text 
itself??  Why I am asking this question is, some veda maNtra-s do appear 
in smruti texts. for exmaple some of the kathopanishad maNtra-s appear in 
smruti text geeta.  Can a non-dvija read these lines plainly, without any 
svara-s and do manana on it prabhuji?? If the answer is yes, then we have 
to say the restriction of vedAdhikAra specifically restricted to proper 
recitation of veda maNtra-s with intonations. 

HariHari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

PS : prabhuji, if you feel this discussion is outside the scope of list 
policies, kindly let me know, I shall write to you directly.
