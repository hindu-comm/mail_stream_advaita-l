Namaskar,

"Gayantan trayate it Gayatri", ie. it is called Gayatri as it protects the one who recites it. One can pray to Mother Sri Lakshmi or Sri Ganeshji by reciting the respective Gayatris and the deities will protect. The Vedic Gayatri of three padas,whichis recited commonly and also by the Aryasamajis is the Veidc Gayatri and it is the essence of the Vedas. It is effective and the Arya samaja booklet explains its meaning. There is a fourth padaused for certain purposes and that is moreforthe Sanyashis. There is also an esoteric Gayatri called "Srividya-pancadasaakshari", which isonly for those initiated to Srividya.

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
