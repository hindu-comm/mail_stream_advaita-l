Dear Shri Chelakaraji,

Nice to know about your interest in Srividya. You can probably start reading about it. Adi Sankaracharya's paramguru Gaudapadacharya had two works, ie. Subhaagodaya and SrIvidyaaratnasutra on Srividya but they are not easily available. A few years agoIreceiveda copy of the Subhaagodaya as gift. I down loaded theSrividyaratnasutra from the Internet. I havethese in India and I am now in Australia. Adi Sankaracharya wrote the Lalita Trishati Bhashya and that is in Sanskrit only. A friend was very kind to send me a photocopy of the same and that too is in India. You may also read the book Saundaryalahari. There is unceratinty about the author of this work but it is a goodwork and theedition published by the Theososphical Society has a very useful introduction. Another good work on it is Varivashyarahashya of Shri Bhaskararaya Makhin.

However the main problem may be to find a guru for that.

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Namaskar,

"Gayantan trayate it Gayatri", ie. it is called Gayatri as it protects the one who recites it. One can pray to Mother Sri Lakshmi or Sri Ganeshji by reciting the respective Gayatris and the deities will protect. The Vedic Gayatri of three padas,whichis recited commonly and also by the Aryasamajis is the Veidc Gayatri and it is the essence of the Vedas. It is effective and the Arya samaja booklet explains its meaning. There is a fourth padaused for certain purposes and that is moreforthe Sanyashis. There is also an esoteric Gayatri called "Srividya-pancadasaakshari", which isonly for those initiated to Srividya.

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
