With this can we say satyakAma-jAbali episode has been written in 
upanishad in this kaliyuga after the real occurrence of the same?? 
Likewise, can we assume bruhadAraNyaka has been written after the personal

these seeming real life incidences have taken entry in apaurusheya veda-s 
& vedanta-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
