Jai Siya Ram

I think there are two issues here, vedic bodha and veda adhyayana.

vedic bodha can be distributed to anyone regardless of any discrimination as
long as the individual is adhikari to the knowledge. Hence during with the
upanishadic era we had mighty female sages such as Gargi etc.

veda adhyayana on the other hand is only given to those with adhikara +
upanayana sanskara. Here there is no if or buts, it's as simple as that.

as with regards to sruti verses within smriti texts, these are fine for
non-dvijas to recite, reason being these texts were specifically made for
the mass population. vyasadeva would not have included these in puranas if
this was not the case. Also if i remember correctly there is a puranaic
purusha sukta which is can be recited by all.
