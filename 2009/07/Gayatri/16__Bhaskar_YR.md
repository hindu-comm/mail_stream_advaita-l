Intiation into the savitri and the rest of the Veda takes place with 
yajnopavita.  There is no provision in any shastra for women or shudras to 

have yajnopavita.  Therefore they have no adhikara.

Can we stretch this and say shudra-s & stree-s donot have adhikAra to do 
brahma jignAsa based on vedAnta vAkya-s??  If the answer is yes, then what 
we have to say about maitreyi, gArgi & other women in veda-s??  Hope, this 
is not heading towards a long chain of mails on 'vedAdhikAra'. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
