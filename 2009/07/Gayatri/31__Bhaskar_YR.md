These mantras are verymuch available in Taittiriya Upanishad, for
which Sri Shankara has commented upon.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

taittireeya mahAnArAyaNa upanishad has some gAyatri maNtra-s including 
ganesha, nandi, garuda, narasimha, shaNmukha, brahma etc.  And in shree 
sUkta lakshmi gAyatri & in durgA sUkta, durga gayatri  also mentioned..But 
I dont think commentary on this has been traditionally ascribed to Sri 
shankara bhagavatpAda.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
