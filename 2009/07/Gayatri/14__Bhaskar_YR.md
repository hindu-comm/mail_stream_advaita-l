Vedokta mantras in particular are not to be recited by women or any man 
who is not 
entitled to or has not undergone yajnopavita.

Humble praNAms Sri Jaldhar prabhuji
Hare Krishna

The issue of this vedAdhikAra (or recitation of veda maNtra-s) is always 
perplexing.  Opinion always vary among many vedic scholars!! What would be 
the authentic source to claim that stree and shudra are not entitle to do 
vedAdhyayana prabhuji?? apashudrAdhikaraNa part of vedAnta sUtra-s, 
comments on it by AchArya & some smruti texts??   kindly clarify.

HariHari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
