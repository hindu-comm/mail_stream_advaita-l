Ah but Megasthenes was a Western scholar -- how could we possibly trust
him...? ;)

Though his calculation for Krishna as c.3850 BCE is interesting ?

Namaste,

Firstly your statement that our scriptures are from the Kali yuga only is
not acceptable to me. You seem to be following the chronology suggested by
the western scholars. Just go through the account of Megasthenes, who in 4th
century BCE gathered information and from that he said that 138 generations
passed from Lord Krishna to his time. Yet Max Muller assigned 12th century
BCE for the Rig Veda on the basis of his proposed Aryan Invasion Theory
(AIT). He did retract his statements later on but the contemporary and
subsequent historians never accepted his retraction..

Secondly you wondered as to how could the seemingly real life incidences
such as of Satyakama have entered the apaurusheya veda-s and vedanta-s but
you never wondered whether your understanding of the the word "Apaurusheya"
is adequate or not. The truths revealed in or the messages conveyed by the
Shruti texts are eternal truths These truths are unbiased and impartial in
nature and are not influenced by human prejudice and that is why these texts
with such conetents are called the Apaurusheya texts.

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Further even in the ancient times some discretions were also permitted as
otherwise how could Sayakama, being a low-born have learnt the Vedas.

With this can we say satyakAma-jAbali episode has been written in
upanishad in this kaliyuga after the real occurrence of the same??
Likewise, can we assume bruhadAraNyaka has been written after the personal
dialogue between yAgnAvalkya & maitreyi?? Just curious to know how can
these seeming real life incidences have taken entry in apaurusheya veda-s
& vedanta-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
