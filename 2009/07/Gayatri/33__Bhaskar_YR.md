But, as Upanishads,
these Gayatri Mantras are as old as the Upanishads itself.

praNAms 
Hare krishna

Apart from these gAyatri-s, we have graha gAyatri maNtra-s also for all 
the nava graha-s...in sudarshana kalpa there are 108 differnt 'sudarshana 
gAyatri maNtra-s...And there is also a book available on 'sakala devatA 
gAyatri maNtrAH' where in you can find gAyatri maNtra for all members of 
Lord rAma family (dasharatha, kausalya, seeta, lakshmaNa, bharata, 
shatrugna, hanuman etc.) and also gAyatri maNtra for gramAdi devata, 
kuladevata that includes pattAlamma, kenchamma, mAramma, kAteramma, 
kaveramma, mArtAnda, bhairava, dhUmrAvati  etc. etc. :-))  I think anyone 
who knows this meter can create gAyatri maNtra of his choice :-))

Hari HariHari Bol!!!
