One can recite any mantra and the deities will protect.  There is nothing 
particularly special about a mantra being in Gayatri form.

This is a list for Advaita Vedanta as taught by Shankaracharya.  You 
should not bring up the nastika Aryasamajis and their misbegotten views 
here.  For any mantra there is the question of adhikara.  Vedokta mantras 
in particular are not to be recited by women or any man who is not 
entitled to or has not undergone yajnopavita.

But for every kind of person there is some upaya.  I don't subscribe to 
the view that some mantras are "powerful" or "effective" and others are 
not.  The power of a mantra is in the mana of the person saying it.  Think 
for example of Maharshi Valmiki who was such an ignoramus he chanted "marA 
marA" Yet he still attained the Highest.

I don't think the panchadashakshari qualifies as any kind of Gayatri.
