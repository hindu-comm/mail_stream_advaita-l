The 'standard' answer is that the Chandogya is an unique 'anthology' of up
to eight 'teaching stories' for brahmacharya from earlier Vedic times, when
society was so self-disciplined that 'discretions' were based on reason..
this is evident in the freedoms accorded to women.

Further even in the ancient times some discretions were also permitted as
otherwise how could Sayakama, being a low-born have learnt the Vedas.

With this can we say satyakAma-jAbali episode has been written in
upanishad in this kaliyuga after the real occurrence of the same??
Likewise, can we assume bruhadAraNyaka has been written after the personal
dialogue between yAgnAvalkya & maitreyi??  Just curious to know how can
these seeming real life incidences have taken entry in apaurusheya veda-s
& vedanta-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
