Stephen,

You will get many answers to your question !
Every religion has its 'mantras' or its divine sayings, to help focus the
mind: the 'Jesus prayer' for instance; or the Greek Kyrie Eleison; or
Islamic sayings.

But the Hindu system of mantra -- which is a complex 'science' -- has
refined its practices in accordance with the wisdom of the seers, for
thousands of years.

Its tradition is that the mantra should only/is best/ given by one who has
inherited that tradition. It would be difficult to explain 'the added bonus'
of this. Ritual, small presents, tradition, atmosphere, solemnity, all go to
the presentation of it, which materialists would discount.. but who's in it
for materialism ? The great thing is that the mantra you have received
should be felt as your best and greatest friend, for life, and bring you
closer and closer to the experience of your real self...

I've glanced at the method you refer to, but can't see any virtue in
applying Hindu meditation to the English alphabet.. though any way of
focussing the mind must be good to a degree.

So I really would recommend that -- at the present time, when the West is
still learning from the East -- you seek out a Hindu teacher of meditation
who is recommended (important !) by someone who finds it successful. It's a
very personal, individual matter. I hope there is someone locally to advise
you on this.

I'll leave it now to the pandits on this site to answer you further on this.

And beyond all advice, and all teachers and all personal struggles, I
treasure the saying of Swami Muktananda, which I've found to be so good to
rely on in this personal adventure of life:

'Meditation will teach you meditation.'

Best wishes,
Michael

Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to write a note, as I am very interested in
doing what I can to learn correctly.  I do not have a meditation teacher at
this time.  I have located however a link to a form of meditation which had
an audio guidance.  Would something like this be appropriate to practice?
Any comments on meditation would be helpful.  I will post the link here>
http://www.meditation-methods.com/hindumeditation.html
I have practiced some meditation sporadically, but as I have said have not
incorporated a formal practice under a teacher.  Thank you again for your
comments.
