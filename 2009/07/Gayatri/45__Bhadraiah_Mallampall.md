JK's teaching about past, future and present makes some sense because in the Ch.U. 7 hierarchy of conditional Brahmans the three highest are smara (memory), asha (hope) and prana (life). Memory represents past, hope represents future and prana represents ever-"present" consciousness. But the way he treats past & future with some sort of disgust doesn't belong in advaita. The reason why Ch.U placed "present" on top is that, all the conditional Brahmans discussed in that chapter are higher than the previous as they successively "include" the previous conditional Brahman as a special case. There is no X vs Y syndrome involved. It is like saying one should reject A & U and meditate on M alone, whereas they successively include the previous. 



Regards

Bhadraiah
