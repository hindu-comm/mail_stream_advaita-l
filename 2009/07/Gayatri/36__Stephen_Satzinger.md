Thank you so much for posting the following words.

 "A person who posts a message asking a question is protecting oneself and
others by making sure an important issue is brought to light. The person
answering it is also protecting others who are not aware of the answer, and
also protecting oneself from the guilt of not answering it knowingly. In
fact any action you do is related to protecting something somewhere."
