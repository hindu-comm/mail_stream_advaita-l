Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to write a note, as I am very interested in
doing what I can to learn correctly.  I do not have a meditation teacher at
this time.  I have located however a link to a form of meditation which had
an audio guidance.  Would something like this be appropriate to practice?
Any comments on meditation would be helpful.  I will post the link here>
http://www.meditation-methods.com/hindumeditation.html
I have practiced some meditation sporadically, but as I have said have not
incorporated a formal practice under a teacher.  Thank you again for your
comments.
