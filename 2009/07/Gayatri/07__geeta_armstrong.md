Namaskar,
I was browsing and have come across'GaneshGayatri, Laksmi Gayatri etc....very puzzling for me.....
Born in anArya Samaj family all I knew of was normal Gayatri and as a devotee of ramakrishna/vivekanandanever heard of any other gayatri....
could some one please enlighten me if these are truegayatri mantras?????
thanks
love
geet
