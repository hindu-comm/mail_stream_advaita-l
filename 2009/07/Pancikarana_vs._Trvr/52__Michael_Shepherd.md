Dear Vidyashankarji,

I hasten to say thatno criticism is intended by my comments! Pancikarana and
Trvrtkarana are indeed to be reflected on; as are all the variations in 'the
Creation story' in the various Upanishads.

But for myself, the question 'How did these statements come about ?' brings
the matter to life.  Dare I say that we are all 'srutins' and 'smrtins'
(probably not correct words..) in that we all 'hear truth' and 'remember
truth' from time to time through atmabrahma ?

The question remains, doesn't it -- can these two apparently contradictory
statements be harmonized in Advaita Vedanta ? Context ? Viewpoint ? And of
course, we must allow for the microscopic and telescopic 'lenses' of mighty
minds who have gone before.

I look forward to enlightenment on this !

Michael
