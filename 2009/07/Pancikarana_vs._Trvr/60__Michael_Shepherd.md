Thanks for the response.. Perhaps I missed Shankara's special reference.
Could you give the reference ? And apologies if it were given before and I
missed it.

Michael ji,

Sankara's special reference to 'Samana Nyaya' admits only inclusive
relations between Trvrtkarana and Pancikarana. Hence I avoided options you
have mentioned which pertains to exclusive relation between Trvrtkarana and
Pancikarana. A meticulous Advaitin trained in Nyaya will treat "Each is a
special case of the other.; Neither is a a special case of the other"
inadmissible to the premise.

With Narayana Smrti,
