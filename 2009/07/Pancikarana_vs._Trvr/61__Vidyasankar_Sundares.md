Again, I beg to differ. The chAndogya bhAshya reference to samAna nyAya admits only a parallel relationship, not inclusive and not exclusive ones between trivRtkaraNa and pancIkaraNa.



To explain this in detail will require quite some discussion, so I will postpone that till the weekend.

Vidyasankar
