As meticulous logicians,  we should add two further options :

Each is a special case of the other.

Neither is a a special case of the other.

The first option allows for a context in which different aspects of Creation
are referred to; the second option allows for a context in which neither is
a fully valid aspect of Creation.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Pancikarana vs. Trvrtkarana (Analysis)



Hari OM~
Shri Sunil ji,

Well this seems to be a good point. When I listed down the options I thought
there cannot be any other case added to the list. There are two ways of
seeing this point "Trivrtkarana is a special case of Pancikarana". Firstly I
see this not different from the third option in mylist especially when the
second part of my statement there is stripped off. Secondly, I am afraid
your point would automatically generate the counter-positive or the
converse case "Pancikarana is a special case of Trvrtkarana" unless you add
some conditional clause to it. Again if you would want to do it, there can
only be two possible conditional clauses that can be
augmented which has already been made available in option 2 and 3 in my
list. Any comments ?

With Narayana Smrti,
