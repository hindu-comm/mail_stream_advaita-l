Dear Bhaskarji,

Quote

especially when shruti itself turning a blind eye on these meticulous details. 

Unquote

Have we not been advised to read the itihaasa and puraana before reading the Shruti so that we can understand what is in the shruti ? 

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

However, studying in what respect Sankara applies a "samAna nyAya" to both 
descriptions is
something that leads to very important insights into his advaita focus. 

Humble praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Though I am enjoying these discussion between your goodself & Sri 
Devanathan prabhuji, I humbly believe that discussions like this can only 
appease the studious interests of some academicians who want to have only 
textual/intellecutal approach towards scriptures. After all, we know that 
srushti has not been systamatically defined in shruti, coz. describing the 
'order' of shrushti is not the primary goal of shruti. Hence shankara 
clarfies in sUtra bhAshya : na cheyaM paramArTha vishayA srushti shrutiH. 
avidyAkalpita nAme rUpa vyavahAra gOcharatvAt...brahmAtmabhAva pratipAdana 
paratvAccha ityetadapi naiva vismartavyaM..(sUtra bhAshya 2-1-33). So, 
whether it is intermixing of 5 elements or it is only intermixing of only 
3 elements hardly matters for a sAdhaka especially when shruti itself 
turning a blind eye on these meticulous details. 

Sri Vidya prabhuji & Sri Devanathan prabhuji kindly pardon me if I said 
anything wrong here.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
