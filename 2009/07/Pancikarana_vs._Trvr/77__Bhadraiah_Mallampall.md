I have no dispute with technical relationships. Yes, the elements are at causal level because they become agents of creation when their time comes. The creation & dissolution events are hard pressed for time because Time itself is in the same state of creation/evolution/dissolution. 



At other times things may appear normal or jadam. A beginning practitioner can assuredly meditate on love or other attributes, no objections. I am curious relevant sources and experiences however low or high; important or unimportant. 



Regards

Bhadraiah
