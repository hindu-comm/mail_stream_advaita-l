Gengtlemen,

Please excuse my ignorance of this matter -- and perhaps that of other readers..

Is all this argument built on the fact that Shankara's (very terse) Pancikarana v.1 speaks of five elements in one context, and Chandogya 6.3.4 mentions only three of them in another context (creation of the devati) ? (The Chandogya having discussed akasha several times in earlier chapters.) 

Please enlighten me. It's not by any means the first time that this question has arisen on this site..

Michael

Dear Vidyasankarji,

I agree. This "Samana" indicates a parallel relationship.

A statement that both "Dvaita" and "Advaita" are true, as Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa used to say, is a "Samana" statement. However Advaita recognisaes Dvaita through Vyavaharika Satya  but Dvaita does not recognise Advaita and that makes Advaita inclusive of Dvaita but the reverse is not implied.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Again, I beg to differ. The chAndogya bhAshya reference to samAna nyAya admits only a parallel relationship, not inclusive and not exclusive ones between trivRtkaraNa and pancIkaraNa.



To explain this in detail will require quite some discussion, so I will postpone that till the weekend.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
