Gentlemen,

With all respects due to the sacred tradition -- I would suggest that as
atmabrahma with the divine gift to be able to observe sagunabrahman in our
worlds, we may have more of a 'seer' in ourselves than we admit !

Who has not a similar tale as this to tell :

'We have had a nameless friction between ourselves, alas, this last few
weeks... yesterday, it flared into a flaming row, which ended with a serious
and truthful exchange of words, which cleared the air, and gave both of us
the feeling of more space : love flowed, we embraced -- and the evening meal
has never tasted so good ! '

I put it to you, ladies and gentlemen of the court, that something in us
knows more of the creative collaboration of the panchikarana through all
worlds than we realise..  ;Â¬)

(An interesting point is that in this case, fire appeared to be the leading
element in the transformation -- the other elements 'inherent')

Michael

Dear Bhaskarji,

Quote

especially when shruti itself turning a blind eye on these meticulous
details.

Unquote

Have we not been advised to read the itihaasa and puraana before reading the
Shruti so that we can understand what is in the shruti ?

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

However, studying in what respect Sankara applies a "samAna nyAya" to both
descriptions is
something that leads to very important insights into his advaita focus.

Humble praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Though I am enjoying these discussion between your goodself & Sri
Devanathan prabhuji, I humbly believe that discussions like this can only
appease the studious interests of some academicians who want to have only
textual/intellecutal approach towards scriptures. After all, we know that
srushti has not been systamatically defined in shruti, coz. describing the
'order' of shrushti is not the primary goal of shruti. Hence shankara
clarfies in sUtra bhAshya : na cheyaM paramArTha vishayA srushti shrutiH.
avidyAkalpita nAme rUpa vyavahAra gOcharatvAt...brahmAtmabhAva pratipAdana
paratvAccha ityetadapi naiva vismartavyaM..(sUtra bhAshya 2-1-33). So,
whether it is intermixing of 5 elements or it is only intermixing of only
3 elements hardly matters for a sAdhaka especially when shruti itself
turning a blind eye on these meticulous details.

Sri Vidya prabhuji & Sri Devanathan prabhuji kindly pardon me if I said
anything wrong here.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
