Dear Vidyasankarji,

I agree. This "Samana" indicates a parallel relationship.

A statement that both "Dvaita" and "Advaita" are true, as Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa used to say, is a "Samana" statement. However Advaita recognisaes Dvaita through Vyavaharika Satya but Dvaita does not recognise Advaita and that makes Advaita inclusive of Dvaita but the reverse is not implied.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Again, I beg to differ. The chAndogya bhAshya reference to samAna nyAya admits only a parallel relationship, not inclusive and not exclusive ones between trivRtkaraNa and pancIkaraNa.



To explain this in detail will require quite some discussion, so I will postpone that till the weekend.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
