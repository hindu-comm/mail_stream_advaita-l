Dear Michael ji,



Let us not straightway slate that Trvrtkarana and Pancikarana are
‘apparently contradictory’ cosmological theories.  Considering the
teleological background of the Sruti and the Nyaya prasthana and its
bhasya-s we may have the following options with us to investigate upon.



   1. Trvrtkarana and Pancikarana are mutually inclusive and there is no
   scope for any contradiction at all
   2. Trvrtkarana alone fetches strong support from Sruti and hence
   Pancikarana is mere ‘logical extension’ and is dependent on the former.
   3. Trvrtkarana implies only Pancikarana and the latter alone is the
   consolidated view of Sruti.



The very desideratum of any speculation on the creation theory in the light
of above points, as I see it, is a commited attempt to insist on Advaita’s
commitment to vitalize the ‘concept of Vyavaharika satya’ in the paradigm of
realities being conceived. The multivalent variation in the Sruti,
especially between Chandogya and Taitiriya on the chosen cosmological issue
apparently calls for a responsible interpretation and essentially reminds us
about the ‘unreality’ of the same from an ultimate standpoint. After all
what all we speak is all about vyavaharika upon the plane of vyavaharika and
whatever we speak on vyavaharika must rationally be  ‘made’ harmonious with
the trans-rational Sruti.



With Narayana Smrti,

Devanathan.J
