You are at liberty to sneer if you wish. The illumination was presented as
from the Advaita Vedanta tradition; that's why i posted the question here.

 The contemplation that the 'elements' are at causal level more than a
reflection of their gross form seems to me too valuable a thought to a true
Advaitin, to be dismissed as some missionary-wallah's distortion of Hinduism
?

Dear Michael,

You can make mathematical permutations between any two models you are
comfortable with, and analyze your situation & express your observations
depending on whether you are below or above either one of the models or both
models. All models of advaita are eligible for samana nyayam. Not sure how
your version of three worlds resolves into advaita.

By who? What scripture? What you heard about "love" sounds more like a a
page from an upcoming Hinduized Bible. None of the Hindu systems of thought
entertain "love" the way you mentioned. I do admit Yajnavalkya taught
Maitreyi about sincere love when he said 'a wife loves her husband for one's
own sake', but his statement is equally true for other types of love - a
leech loves its source of blood for one's own sake, a colonialist loves his
subjects for one's own sake. Why only love, what is wrong with hate? An
Abrahamic or a Jihadist hates a pagan/sinner or kafir respectively for one's
own sake.

>I'd guess that it is invaluable in interpreting the Veda.


You decide.

Bhadraiah
