Please can anyone provide a reference for the 'table' of the appearance of
the five elements in the three worlds ?

I was given it orally years ago -- and was so delighted with the statement
that 'water' is love at the causal level, binds at the subtle level, and
flows at the physical level... that I failed to remember the rest of the
table !

I'd guess that it is invaluable in interpreting the Veda.
