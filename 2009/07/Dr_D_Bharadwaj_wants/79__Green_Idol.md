Hey,

I've just joined the Green Idol campaign and told Prime Minister Manmohan  
Singh that he has no time to lose.

If he's serious about fighting climate change – as he should be – then he  
MUST have a Renewable Energy Law in place by 2010. That's next year!

I know he's not going to do it just because I asked him to. But if he starts  
getting hundreds of thousands of other Indian citizens asking him too,  
he’ll have no option.

Do what I’ve done. Save the climate. Be a Green Idol! Tell Dr. Manmohan  
Singh now at

Thanks a million,
Dr D Bharadwaj
