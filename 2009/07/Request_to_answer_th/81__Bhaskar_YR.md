Though the statement is convincing as it gives a practical example, how 
does one explain the different levels of suffering for different 
individuals? I mean, though everyone is the same, we all suffer 
differently. So we are bound to have anger, greed etc,.

How same electricity (power) appears as revolving force in fan and heating 
element in stove, cooling gadget   in refrigerator??  I think answer lies 
there...Due to nAma rUpa (name & form) upAdhi (limited adjuncts) 
sambandha, it appears that jeeva is suffering differently in different 
compartments of body, mind & intellect...but jeeva is neither sufferer, 
nor enjoyer, nor doer...thinking that I am doer, sufferer, enjoyer is the 
basic ignorance that vedanta asks us to get rid off through sAdhana....

HariHari Hari Bol!!!
