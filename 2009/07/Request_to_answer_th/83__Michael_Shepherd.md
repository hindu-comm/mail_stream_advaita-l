Murali ji,

I can guess what my guru would say to this  :
 'Speak only to the perfect self in them : that is not only the best thing
you can do for them; it is the only thing you can 'do' for them..'

To which he might add if he were in acerbic mood, 'Why burden them with your
compassion...?' !

Namasthe,
Michael

Namasthe all,

Which is a more appropriate way  for a vedantist to respond/behave while
dealing with pains / sufferings of others ?

Do they attribute the situation to law of karma, explain the hidden rational
and help the sufferer realise?  Or do they practise to consider this
suffering as aspect of maya and opt to move on with
a prayer to reduce/remove  the suffering ?  Or do they opt to own the
responsibility and "act" to reduce the suffering out of the unconditional
love ?  What are the guildlines on this as per the shashtras?
Thankyou,
Murali
