Namaste

Shantananda said once -- to my surprise -- that compassion is a natural
emanation from atman. (Perhaps reason should not have been surprised...)For
me, that simplifies the process of 'caring'.

Namaste,

Swami Vivekananda says that the sufferings of people are due to their past
karma but we should make it our karma to help those who suffer.

Sincerely,

Namasthe all,

Which is a more appropriate way for a vedantist to respond/behave while
dealing with pains / sufferings of others ?

Do they attribute the situation to law of karma, explain the hidden rational
and help the sufferer realise? Or do they practise to consider this
suffering as aspect of maya and opt to move on with
a prayer to reduce/remove the suffering ? Or do they opt to own the
responsibility and "act" to reduce the suffering out of the unconditional
love ? What are the guildlines on this as per the shashtras?
Thankyou,
Murali
