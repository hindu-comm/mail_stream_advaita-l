Yes. We have toremember that the sufferings are due to our own karma and we have also to bear the sufferingskeeping in mind thatthese are at the physical level and being transient these will go away. While allowing the past karma to fade away this way one has to lead the life in such a way that fresh karmawould not affect one and that is possible by doing work for the Lordand notfor one's self-interest.This is sound advice no doubt. 

We can also surrender toLord and seek help. Some Buddhistsprobably pray to Lord Amitava Buddha or the Medicine Buddha for help.Lord will help us through His agencies.He will not spoon-feed us but surrendering toLordwill help us work with optimism and in the right spirit.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

The suffering is not at the soul (atman )level, it is at the physical level.
mAtra sparShAstu kaunteya shItOShNa sukha dukhadAH - the dualities like
heat and cold or happiness and sorrow are due to interaction of sense organs
with sense objects - gIta (2-14). Different people have different levels of
threshold for pain and suffering and it has nothing to do with suffering
itself. Practice of titIkSha - abilty to endure pain and suffering. This
comes by practice and carried by the subtle body over multiple physical 
bodies (births)

Anger and greed are independent of suffering. They are inversely
proportional to titIkSha.

Regards,
Ramakrishna.

Dear Sirs,
 
 Namaste.Recently, I read in a book that 

"Our soul is like electricity- a form of energy which can neither be created
nor be destroyed but can be transferred from one form to another. The
electricity (source)is the same, but it manifests in different forms
(individuals) - as air from fan, as light from a bulb etc. So, if we
understand that the same energy is manifesting in different individuals,
there will be no room for anger, greed, jealousy etc."

 Though the statement is convincing as it gives a practical
example, how does one explain the different levels of suffering for
different individuals? I mean, though everyone is the same, we all suffer
differently. So we are bound to have anger, greed etc,.

Thank you

Yours sincerely,
N s Jayaram
