Sri Srinivas,
Namaste.

 Thanks for the heads-up about the Shankara volumes. We just might rustle up
a few orders from the UK for such a treasure..

Michael

Subject: [Advaita-l] Complete works of Shankaracharya



I received email from Samata publishers asking for help. They are selling
original Sanskrit "Complete Works of Shankaracharya" a 10-volume series for
4000 rupees (NOT including shipping charges). In the past I paid 12,000
rupees for the same plus Fedex international priority to USA. I read
portions of some of those books; I can say every penny of the money I spent
is well spent. These books are reprint of original "Vani Vilas Press"
version. In my opinion, even if you are not very proficient in Sanskrit
right now, I would say seize this opportunity and obtain these books.
Consider it a rare privilege to possess these books. In a few years, there
won't be any publisher able to or willing to print these books. If you can
afford, please pay as much money as you can (more than 4000 rupees I mean),
to the publisher, for these books.

I am enclosing the email I received from the publisher. Note that I have NO
financial interest in this whole thing.

For all queries please contact the publisher at samatabooks at gmail.com
