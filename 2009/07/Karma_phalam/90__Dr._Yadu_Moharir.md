Namaste:

Can scholars educate us is the thoughts expressed really fit into Shankar's advaita ?

Could the mentionedthinking of leaving for "Lord" to resolve may have made propelled India in becoming niShakriiya and more reliant of mysticism?

If I am integral part of that 'iishavara" than is it not my responsibility to create ":haevenm on this Earth and change the perspective of general population? IMO - That is exactly why Acharya tries to do by encompassing all the five essential deities into "pa~nchaayata puujaa". That way vaiShaNaa, shaivaa, gaaNapatya, shakti uaasakaawould be together than being apart of the same !?.

I can totally relate to the20 % probability function expresses in giitaa.

Dear members
Karma is one which can not be avoided by a jeeva.It always gives its phala-both good and bad as per our scales.Our scriptures therefore advocate bear your karma phala silently till it gets exhausted and avoid doing karmas which bind you further.This is possible if the karmas -whtevermay be the type-kamya,nithya,nymithika,nishkamya-are done for their sake with the attitude of -I am not the doer-that is egoless-.I think that the attitude with which we do our acts counts.As for us the duty or the expectation of the society at large is to express their solidarity with the sufferer to alleviate the sufferings as grief shared is grief halved.In Hindu way of life one is ordained to participate more in grief situations than in happy situations.R.Krishnamoorthy.
