Would you put 'Om Namah Shivaya' beyond the bounds of surrender or Advaita ?
If so, I'm sorry for you, in my Abrahmanic way.. :)

Subject: *** SPAM ***[Advaita-l] praNava






The quotation "pravaNayati iti praNava:" may be authentic than "praNAmayati
iti praNava:".



Here is a reference from vaikhasana agama, but I have seen this elsewhere in
a brahmana also:



http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/bhakti-list/135901-monographs-vaikhanasa-
agama.html



Tai Pr. xviii says one of the forms of praNava can also be a circumflex
which is anyway a pravaNa (slide).



The extrapolation to bowing andbent knees is a needless (Abrahamic?)
extrapolation. praNava is

surely a symbol of offering, but at the time of offer the offerer merges
into the offered deity through

bhakti and achieves oneness with the deity; only then the offering is
complete. I do admit a number of

bhaktas on this and other boards talk about "surrendering" to Lord but this
is clearly a dvaita word,

if not Abrahamic. There is no bowing or surrendering in advaita. I would
rather be a surEnder (indra)

than surrender :-)



Regards

Bhadraiah
