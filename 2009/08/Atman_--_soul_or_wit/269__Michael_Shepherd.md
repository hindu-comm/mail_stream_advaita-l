Savithri

That reminds me of the smrti :

I am the vault and the vaulter;
I am the ground and the spring;
I am the bar and the transcendence..

Michael :)

Absolutely, sruti tells us that brahman and atma are one and the same, and
that we don't have to look elsewhere.Sruti iscalled antya pramaNa
becauseit clearly tells us what atma is not (not this, not this..., you are
that, etc.) and negates that last vestige of doership, our intellect, that
was used as a pole(pole-vaulting). This knowledge thatwe are always
atman/brahman here and now and forever (purusha) should give us the
conviction to act(vastu tantra)in the right spirit until we have eliminated
the dusty sheaths that have prevented us from realizing this so far. This is
how I would reconcile vastu/purusha tantra aspects into sadhana.
Regards,
Savithri

Namaste Savithri

I'm sure you're right, and good luck !

Though I do think that the mahavakya encourage us to work through 'this-here
atman' ! Doesn't that resolve the purusa/vastu ?

Namaste Michael-

How indeed do welive the truth of "atmanis brahman" - this is the billion
dollar question.

"Atma as the eternal witness" is not something we can practice, or something
we can repeat to gain the experience of this statement - it is at best an
inference from examining the three states and analyzing our experiences
based on sruti. In eachexperience we believe we are the witnessing
consciousness, I think we are deluding ourselves because consciousness is
objectified is all these experiences andit is no more the eternal witness
then. We really can't wilfully be the eternal witness.
In other words, it is not exactly a purusha-tantra sadhana to realize the
pure consciousness. Many Sruti vaakyas havespecified that realization
isvastu-tantra, not purusha-tantra.

When this exact question was raised, the answer from swamis livingin
austerities has been the same - perform nishkaama karma, clean the mind off
of its dull and dross and leave the rest.

In my opinion, theonly practical thing to do would be to perform our nitya
and naimittika karmas without attachment, and operate in the transactional
world from a place of fullnessfully believing we arethe infinite and lack
nothing, until this becomes our nature effortlessly.

my 2 cents,
Savithri

The mahavakya all remind us of the shared identity of atman and Brahman.

But how do we personally enter the truth of this ?

Some teachers and gurus emphasise the practicality of atman as eternal
witness, whom we can invite to witness every thought, every word, every
action; as a means to unite with Brahman in the simplest possible manner.

But I note that 'atman as witness' doesn't seem to figure much in classical
texts. Or am I wrong ? Is this more implied than stated outright ?

I'd appreciate comment.

Michael
