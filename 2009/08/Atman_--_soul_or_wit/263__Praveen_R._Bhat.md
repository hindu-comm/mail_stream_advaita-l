sAkSin is never seen. The very idea of sAkSin is that It sees everything.
The moment you try to see *It*, you take the role of a fake sAkSin who sort
of claims to be the sAkSin ad-infinitum, which as you say is really part of
the antahkaraNa.

I do hope that you are using Self as another word for the sAkSin, or did you
mean it to be different. If so, in which way would you differentiate sAksin
from the Self?

The effectiveness of Bhagavan Ramana's teaching is in its directness, albeit
difficult. Any other approach was not really encouraged by him, IMHO,
although he never negated anyone's following when mentioned. On a related
note, I am, perhaps, one of the few who consider Maharshi's real/ core
teaching as "Be as you are" (Summa iru) than "Who am I?" (Naan yaar)
