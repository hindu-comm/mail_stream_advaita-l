The term "veda trayii" indeed refers to the 3 types of vaidika
mantra-s - R^ik, yajush and saaman.

As the names of the first 3 Veda-s are associated with the mantra type
dominant in them, there has arisen a misconception that the term term
"veda trayii" excludes the Atharvaveda but it is not so. It is
actually a reference to the 3 types of vaidika mantra-s rather than 3
Veda-s per se.

<< Two Upanishads from the Atharvanaveda - Mundaka and Prasna - are
included in the list of Ten Upanishads commentated by Sri
Sankaracharya. >>

Add the Mandukya too.
