Hari Om,

I'd voiced my assumption initially that this particular thread would go on
painfully distasteful lines, be it for some like me, and be it for whatever
reasons. When it involves a definition of varNa, I reckon, it generally
brings out people's biases and some preferred versions of histories. Well,
for each his own...

Just like most of us, I too prefer one version myself and for those who like
the description opposite to "lifeless pillars" for brAhmaNas during various
troubled times of India (and God knows there have been many), I recommend
listening to Marathi discourse(s) by Shri Wa Na Utpat of Pandharpur, called
"garv se kaho hum brAhmaNa hai".

Apologies in advance if this adds fuel to the ongoing (risk of) fire.

Ta,
--Praveen R. Bhat
