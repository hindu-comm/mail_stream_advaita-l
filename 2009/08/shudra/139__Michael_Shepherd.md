Praveenji,

Personal apologies... some of us arrive with warm and very personal
questions which call for a live response.. and sometimes we do get around to
referring to the archives... if offered the coutesy of a precise reference
there; rather than read of old arguments..

Michael

Hari Om,

For some reason, this particular topic never seems to die off. It keeps on
coming up every year or so in some form, runs in circles, no one agreeing to
a common ground, getting repetitive, and eventually forcing the moderators
to voice and close the thread. I wonder why people tend to not search
archives for the same.

Apologies, just a loud thought!

praNAm,
