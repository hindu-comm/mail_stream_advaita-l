'Asathoma sat gamaya' is a vedic prayer and not a statement nor a dictum.
This prayer is for those who think that the Being is unknowing!
Sunilji, if you get something that you didn't already posses it will be
lost.  So getting is useless.  If you know you already got it what is the
need to 'get' it?  So all you are talking about is "I don't know that I
already got it."  So much so, would not knowing make a difference?
