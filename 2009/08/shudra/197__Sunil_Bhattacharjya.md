Namaste,

Probably I should have made the statementlike this. The Muslims could completelyroute the Zarastrianism and Buddhism from the places wherever they went but then why could they not do so to Hinduism? The conspicuously-robed Buddhist monks carried the torch of Buddhism. When Bakhtyar Khilji destroyed Nalanda university,killedits 10,000 students and teachers/monks,destroyed the library with innumerable books and destroyed thousands of Buddha-viharas wherever he went the Buddhism practically vanished from India. So much so that even the Diamond sutra and the Heart sutra had to be back-translated from the Chinese language to Sanskrit. But the Hindu Brahmins succesfully preserved the important texts and the knowledge despite the vicious environment. It is regretteble that by wearing the critic's cap you lost the balance or else you would have realised this sterling contribution of the Brahmins.

Any scientist will tell you or even common sense should tell you that statistically it is not possible that all the Brahmins to be Brahma-jnani at any time. Secondly apart from the highly scholastic work the priesthood was also part of the Brahmanic duty and some Brahmins had to take specialised training for the rituals etc. Then how can you expect the priests of the Somnath temple tofight the well-trained army ofMuhammad Ghoriof Ghazni wit their bare hands? Do you think that their ladles used for pouring Havih to the fire would have been adequate to repulse the weapons of the enemy. Again you seem to have lost your balance here.

Thirdly you have not quoted any authentic record to prove thatthat the Brahmins only prayed to the Lord instead of fighting the army of Mahammad Ghori with their barehands orwith the ladle used for pouring habih in the havan.You also conveniently seem to have forgotten about the duties of Kshatriyas.

You don't evenseem to care forbalanced criticism. You have not really countered the structure of the language for whichthe Sanskrit language has been giventhe credit that it is great for the computers. I think you have to do a lot of reading before publicly criticising such issues.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Namaste:

Yes, Hinduism survived but that is purely academic as Brahmin's remained as lifeless pillars that supported the roof.

When Mohd.. Gajhani attacked Somanath temple Brahmins recited"Mahaarudra" and requested Shiva to open his "third" eye. The third for Shiva is supposed to be "j~naana chakhsu" to burn ignorance. When are we going to admit that it was the "Blind-Faith" on deities and Brahmin's that wanted to keep their importance in the society were primarily responsible for loss of our vedic knowledge as they remain the donkeys carryiong the weight of sandlewood.

The number of Moron Sadhu's visiting US are hiding behind the the term "shaddhaa" and propagate Mysticism to line their own pockets for profit.

I have absolute no regard to the folks who promote recitation instead of understanding.

We rather remain slaves than become Gods and create heaven on this Earth. The concept for preferroing to remain "daasa" is clearly found in R^igveda as we want someone (deities)else to make us rich by remaining "daasa" (shuudra).

The latest fashion is that Sanskrit is great for Computers, but does anyone seriously think whether programmers are ever going to learn Sanskrit before programming ? This is just a feel good thing !? So much for Brahmin's. 

I know all of us though born in Brahman families and have undergone upanayana samskaraara, did sandhyaavadanama,doclean toilets in USneed to be classified as"shudra" !!

How about the scholars opinion that Hinduism survived the onslaught of the Muslim invasions and rule because of the Brahmins?

It means you ought to study the impact of Buddhism instead of being biased
in its favour!
If a condition in India gave rise to Buddhism, then there are two resulting
situations considering that Buddhism declined in India.

One is that the need gets fulfilled and Buddhism served its purpose. Did
it?

The other is like a condition that gives rise to the weed in a field which
condition gets rectified and the weeds are out. Here Buddhism is compared
to the weed.

You have to determine which one of this was the result.

Under Buddhism the role of Brahmins as an entity was unneeded as much as it
is under Hinduism. When something is not needed it will not exist.
