Hari Om,

For some reason, this particular topic never seems to die off. It keeps on
coming up every year or so in some form, runs in circles, no one agreeing to
a common ground, getting repetitive, and eventually forcing the moderators
to voice and close the thread. I wonder why people tend to not search
archives for the same.

Apologies, just a loud thought!

praNAm,
