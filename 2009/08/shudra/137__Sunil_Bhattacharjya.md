Yes. The past karma does haveits role to decide where one takes his birth. Did not Lord Krishna say that a Yogi takes birth in a family of Yogis? A boy born in a brahmin family grows upwith the austere food habits and in austere life-style, which areconducive to Brahmanical activities. So he is naturally predisoposed towards Brahmanical studies and activities. Even today, in general, a businessman's son prefers to go for business, sooner or later.

Dear Michaelji,

Everybody is Shudra at birth. Bhagavad Gita (18.41) says that the activities
of the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras are differentiated in
harmony with their aptitude and nature. --------

Everyone is a shUdra by birth is not to be read literally. The intended 
Meaning is that the responsibilities and obligations of a brAhmaNa before
the upanayana samskAra (initiation to the study of scriptures) and that of a
ShUdra are not different. What really differentiates between a brAhmaNa and
shUdra in the pre-initiation period is that a brAhmaNa is qualified to
receive upanayana, where as the shUdra is not; the growth and evolution
Of the individual jIva in the previous life/lives is what determines this
qualification and accordingly he is born to a brAhmaNa or shUdra (or for
that matter a kshatriya or vaishya) parents.

Regards,
K. Ramakrishna.
