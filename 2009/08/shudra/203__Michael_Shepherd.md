Anbuji,

I'm a somewhat 'liberated' poet. I write something down; then try to
understand what I've written..

What I was implying was : we are all the self, complete. Nothing is not
known to us. We may be born, or designated, sudra, vaisya, kshatriya,
brahmin. Yet every day most of us are required to fulfil the role
of --obedient service under instruction; exchanging our goods and services;
commanding and defending others; and even, some of us, finding time to study
the scriptures (or at least, studying ourselves, aided by that wonderful
atman...).

So the varna have their realities and actualities, and we experience them. I
would even dare to suggest (remembering my own suffering while trying to
find the 'right place in society' ... I want to know the truth, think from
the truth, act from the truth, etc.) -- that a happy man knows all varna;
while at that moment, acting out one role or another... and knowing that
they are roles...

I don't know whether that helps. Probably not !

Michael

Michaelji,
I wish to understand you more clearly when you say: " we pass through all
varna from
sudra to brahmana in a single working day !"
