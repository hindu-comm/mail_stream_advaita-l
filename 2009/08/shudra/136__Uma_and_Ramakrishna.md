Dear Michaelji,

Everybody is Shudra at birth. Bhagavad Gita (18.41) says that the activities
of the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras are differentiated in
harmony with their aptitude and nature. --------

---------------------------

Everyone is a shUdra by birth is not to be read literally. The intended 
Meaning is that the responsibilities and obligations of a brAhmaNa before
the upanayana samskAra (initiation to the study of scriptures) and that of a
ShUdra are not different. What really differentiates between a brAhmaNa and
shUdra in the pre-initiation period is that a brAhmaNa is qualified to
receive upanayana, where as the shUdra is not; the growth and evolution
Of the individual jIva in the previous life/lives is what determines this
qualification and accordingly he is born to a brAhmaNa or shUdra (or for
that matter a kshatriya or vaishya) parents.

Regards,
K. Ramakrishna.
