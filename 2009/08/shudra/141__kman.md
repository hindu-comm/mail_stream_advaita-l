Thanks Michael for your enlightened discussion of this uncomfortable
subject.
I agree with your line of thought. Lord Krishna is a Yadav. even though
people will say
otherwise just to give credence to their age old biases and Veda Vyasa was a
fisherman by birth.
I find the following statement very amusing in this day and age where food
and
work habits worldwide have eveolved proving karma has nothing to do with
where and to whom you are born. I think Varna and  Advaita is an oximoron.

" However the food
habits (or rather the food requirements for) people of different professions
were different. The brahmins had austere food-habits and austere life-style
and thus the profession-wise distances grew up in the course of time."
