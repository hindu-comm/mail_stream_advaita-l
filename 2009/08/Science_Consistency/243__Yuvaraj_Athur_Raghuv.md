Hello,

Science as I know it is largely consistent. However there are
paradoxes (like EPR, Schrodinger's cat, etc) which are indications of
potential inconsistencies in the theories so far proposed. Paradoxes
pushes understanding further since that is when new theories replace
older ones to explain  the observed phenomena.

However, from my understanding of Goedel's work in logic, a consistent
logical system cannot prove all true statements. This means that there
can exist statements that are true but not provably true. To me,
scientific explaination is at the level of proof. And thus in a
consistent scientific theory, I would expect incompleteness.

Hope this helps,
Yuva
