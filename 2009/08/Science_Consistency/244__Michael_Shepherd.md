Nice question to ponder !

Since 'science' means 'knowing', I suggest that all the sciences must be of
their nature, analogous to sadhana : indriya under the witness of atman lead
to chid-abhaasa and to chit, which however needs constant refreshment from
chid...

Donald Rumsfeld was laughed at for this -- but he spoke truth :

'There are things we know we know; and things we know we don't know; and
things we don't know we don't know...'

Could be a definition of sadhana ? :)

Hello,

Science as I know it is largely consistent. However there are
paradoxes (like EPR, Schrodinger's cat, etc) which are indications of
potential inconsistencies in the theories so far proposed. Paradoxes
pushes understanding further since that is when new theories replace
older ones to explain  the observed phenomena.

However, from my understanding of Goedel's work in logic, a consistent
logical system cannot prove all true statements. This means that there
can exist statements that are true but not provably true. To me,
scientific explaination is at the level of proof. And thus in a
consistent scientific theory, I would expect incompleteness.

Hope this helps,
Yuva
