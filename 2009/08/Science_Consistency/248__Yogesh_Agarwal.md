> Is science logically consistent?

Hello,

Some game of words in my neurons, they are never sufficient :-(
Something consistent may not be truth , but logical consistency should have
been a must for truth [I donÂ’t know if this particular thought is
hypothesis, perception or intuition] , so true science should be logically
consistent, any science which is not true can just be discarded of its being
science ..

Yogesh

Namaste:

IMO: Yes, the spirituality of science is desire to look for the truth.

The phrase "neti-neti" which is commonly used the Vedanta is a the answer to
the question, is this the truth. So the journey for finding the truth
continues.

Science starts with ahypothesis, designs an experimental model, conducts
the experiment, observes the results and arrives at the conclusion. If
conclusion "superimposes" with hypothesis then one finds the truth. If this
does not match then the scientist refines his hypothesis and repeats his
experiment. IMO - This the utilization of "neti-neti" concept and thus
science and spiritual concepts have a direct consistent relationship.

Kind Regards,

DR. Yadu

Hmm perhaps this question might get a better answer in a philosophy of
science list but my understanding is this. While the fundemental
underpinnings of science aren't 100% settled yet, most scientists have hope
that they can be.

Or I have heard it put this way: All of biology is a branch of chemistry,
all of chemistry is a branch of physics, and all of physics is a branch of
mathematics!
