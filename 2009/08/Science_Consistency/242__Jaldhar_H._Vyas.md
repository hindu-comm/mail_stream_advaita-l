Hmm perhaps this question might get a better answer in a philosophy of 
science list but my understanding is this.  While the fundemental 
underpinnings of science aren't 100% settled yet, most scientists have 
hope that they can be.

Or I have heard it put this way: All of biology is a branch of chemistry, all 
of chemistry is a branch of physics, and all of physics is a branch of 
mathematics!
