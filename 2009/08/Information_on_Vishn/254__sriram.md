Dear Members
The Vishnu Sahasranamam is set on anushtup chandhas-that is after each 8 
letters another set of eight letters will follow which will enable us do the 
padhaschedam properly -this is my understanding.But differences do exist in 
segregating the namas by Sri Sankara,Sri Ramanuja and Sri
Madhwa.But they are all unanimous in the total number of namas as thousand 
only.R.Krishnamoorthy.
