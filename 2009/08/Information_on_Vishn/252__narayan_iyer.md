Namaste,

I would like any of the learned members to clarify the following:

Before reciting Sri Vishnu Sahasranamam, we begin:

" Sri Veda VyasO Bhagavan Rishi, Anushtub chanda: Sri Mahavishnu Paramaathmaa Sriman NaarayaNo devataâ€¦."

I understand the chandas metre to be of 32 letters. Which sloka has 32 letters in VS? Is it dhyana sloka or any other sloka/mantra in VS?
There are many slokas of different letter-counts. Do they also belong to Anushtub chandas?

I learnt on the net that anushtub chandas (32 letters) is used for narration and thrishtub (44 letters) is used for praise/to express the song of devotion etc. Is the information correct?

Are all sahasranamams composed in Anushtub chandas? 

Thanks in advance for any information

With regards,

narayan
