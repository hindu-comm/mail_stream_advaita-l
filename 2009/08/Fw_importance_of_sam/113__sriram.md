Dear Members
The lines I have used are from my memory and these were told by a pravachana kartha in my younger days.He gave a story also telling during the gurukul days the students used to be served with a drop of castor oil in the place of ghee and when a student says something is wrong with the smell the guru used to cull him out.Perhaps it was coined by the pravachana kartha to make his point that students should concentrate on studies only.I stand corrected.R.Krishnamoorthy.
