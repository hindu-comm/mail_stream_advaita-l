Please note that at the very beginning of rudram (namakam), the word "manyu"
comes. It is one of the names of Siva.
The name is used for any other *manifestation* of Him (Siva = Narayana =
paramaatma = parabrahma) signified by power, energy, passion,
mission-orientedness, etc.
Hence, *manyusUktam* is used for worshipping (*abhishEkam*) to Siva (as
rudra), narasimha and AnjanEya. Moreover, it is preferably to be used when
we are in "need" of this expressive/active/ferocious (didn't want to use
this word due to fear of misinterpretation) form of the "divine energy."
That is why, though it is listed in pancha-sUktas, it has to be used with
proper initiation and with due 'care.' Otherwise, it is difficult to
stand/sustain the energy. In short: Be properly initiated, advised and
guided.
