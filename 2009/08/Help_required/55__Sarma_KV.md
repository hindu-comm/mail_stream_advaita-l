Anjana,

Compare the leadership styles of "Rama" and "Ravana" also.
Even if y you see sundarakaanDa, when Hanuman destroys Asoka-vana, Ravana
sends first soldiers, then military leaders, then ministers' sons, then his
sons etc.. all of them get killed, till Hanuman Himself decides to "obey"
the brahma-astra fired at him by Meghanaatha. Even this is not defeat, but
it is Hanuman's self-decided 'cease-fire.' Hanuman does this to meet His
original objective of seeing/assessing Ravana and his strength. This clearly
shows the flaw in Ravana's leadership.

Best Regards,
-Sarma KV
