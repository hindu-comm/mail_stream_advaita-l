Dear members,

I am currently researching Hindu texts addressing the theme of 'leadership' , the most obvious one being the Mahabharatha. This is for an MBA dissertation and the theme is a comparison of leadership styles in Hindu texts with modern 'western' concepts.

I was hoping that someone could suggest some useful texts handling this topic or provide some ideas as to how to approach the subject matter.

Your assistance is greatly appreciated, anjana
