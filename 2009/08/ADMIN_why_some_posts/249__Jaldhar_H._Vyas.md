A number of you have written messages to advaita-l which have not appeared 
on the list.  The reason is that you have responded to the digest and not 
trimmed out excess material.  This causes your emails to be very large and 
the list server software rejects them out of hand as a security measure.

Readers, whether you subscribe to the digest or not, when you respond to 
an email only quote the bits you are responding to and delete the rest.
