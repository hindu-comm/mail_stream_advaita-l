I fully agree with your Vedanta teacher, and my humblenamaskarams to Him or Her.

Who told you that in our sampradaya we do not question the teacher - in fact we are very muchencouraged to - nay, we are specifically instructed to question the teacher till our doubts get resolved - this is exactly what shravanam and mananam entails - atmavare shrotavya mantavya...this degree of freedom of questioning I would say is almost unique to our sampradaya - doubt is encouraged provided it is encompassedby abroader matrixof shraddha - in both the teacher and the teaching. Only then can learning take place.

These were2posts writtenby me on the "advaitin" list-forum in response to a discussion on a related topic and I am reproducing it here for what its worth. Some of the points raised are relevant only to what was being discussed atthe time,but I have chosen not to edit those sections in the interest of continuity of the post.

As far as Namasmarana and Kaliyuga is concerned consider that statementto be eulogistic at best - albeit certainly a wonderful means to achieving chittashuddhi and chitta-naischalyam, (like with everything else)when adopted with the right attitude and devotion.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Importance of Sampradaya



Dear all,

My Vedanta teacher often reiterates the importance of traditional Sampradaya
teaching methods as the ONLY way to self-knowledge....

A few doubts arise in my mind regarding this although Sampradaya asks that
we do not question the teacher! what about all those masters who achieved
moksha through following the non-hindu religions? what about the concept of
constant Namasmarana being the easiest way to achieve liberation in the Kali
Yuga?

i would appreciate your views on this..anjana
