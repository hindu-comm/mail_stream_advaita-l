It is always a delight to read or hear subhAShitas (wise sayings). In this connection, there is a subhAShita:



bhAShAsu mukhyA madhurA divyA gIrvANabhAratI |



tasmAddhi kAvyaM madhuraM tasmAdapi subhAShitam.h ||



Among languages, Sanskrit is eminent, sweet, and divine. Sweeter is Sanskrit poetry

 (kAvya); even sweeter is subhAShita. 





And,



saMsArakaTuvR^ikShasya dve phale hyamR^itopame |



subhAShitarasAsvAdaH saMgatiH sujane jane            ||



In the bitter tree called saMsAra (worldly life) there are two fruits as sweet as nectar.

Tasting the rasa of subhAShitas and the company of good people.
