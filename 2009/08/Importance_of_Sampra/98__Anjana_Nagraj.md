Dear all,

My Vedanta teacher often reiterates the importance of traditional Sampradaya teaching methods as the ONLY way to self-knowledge....

A few doubts arise in my mind regarding this although Sampradaya asks that we do not question the teacher! what about all those masters who achieved moksha through following the non-hindu religions? what about the concept of constant Namasmarana being the easiest way to achieve liberation in the Kali Yuga?

i would appreciate your views on this..anjana
