Whether the Shudra were a tribe subjected to servitude by their conquerors,
and thus seen in Puranic times as sorrowful in their plight (as also with
the Dasa tribe), is one question fully annotated in his book on Shudra by
the great Professor Sharma -- who must be nearing 90 now ?

Subject: [Advaita-l] Discussion on "Shudra"



With reference to the above discussion,the word "Shudra",has different
meanings.In Vedic parlance,this means "one who is in sorrow"(vide,Raikva
episode).The Vedanta has only one aim.Its purpose is to eliminate sorrow
whoever it is.
