Professor Sharma in his book on Sudra pp 42-43 goes into the matter of Cha.
Up. 4.2.3. and Shankara's bhasya and Badarayana's derivation, and whether
Janasruti was in fact a king of the Sudra tribe -- already in subjection by
that time.

With reference to the reply on the above,I would like Sri.satish to go
through the discussion in Chandogya Upanishad on Janusruthi and raikva
dialogue.We are talking about Brahmajnana,and not common place issues.
                                                        N.Srikanta.
