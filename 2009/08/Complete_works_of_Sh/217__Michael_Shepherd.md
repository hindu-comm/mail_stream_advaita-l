Thanks for the reminder about Samata's plight -- and treasures. I have high
hopes of several orders from the UK for the Complete Works of Shankaracharya
very soon !

Thanks for alerting us to this.  In these tough economic times, many
publishers are struggling.  I can't help but feel a little personally
responsible too.  The ready availability of even the most esoteric
information on the Internet is also affecting publishers.  I plan to start
publishing some books on Vedanta myself (more info soon) and that will
also mean competition for publishers.  Then again I remind myself that
despite having access to all these websites I still keep buying books.
(Including this set of complete works of Shankaracharya.)  So I am not
as pessimistic about the ability of people like Samata to survive.  I urge
all readers who can to buy this series.  Another book they publish which I
recommend is called "Essence of Yogavasishtha"  which is an English
translation of Yogavasishthasarasangrah, an abridgement of Yogavasishtha
Ramayana  by Swami Jnananada Bharati.
