I asked Mr Krishna if he would set up PayPal, as this is in my experience
the safest and simplest payment method now. (It's been taken over by eBay.)
I believe he has now done this.

In fact one of my friends paid 'on the spot' in a Delhi bookshop with the
aid of his laptop and  a PayPal account !

Mr. Satzinger

Why don't you talk to Mr. Krishna directly? His number is +91-94440 1070
(GMT+05:30).

International wire transfers into India are quite a tedious affair. To my
knowledge Axis Bank does not have a direct SWIFT code; it would use a
correspondent bank in New York; once the money is credited to Axis Bank's
account in NY, it is transferred (manually, I suspect) to its Mumbai account
and from there to wherever Mr. Krishna's account is (again, manually). The
whole process might take three days, and more frustratingly multiple
attempts (I had to do visit the bank - BoA - thrice in Fremont, CA to wire
transfer some money to Hyderabad).

I had bought the set of complete works from him (ten volumes in Sanskrit,
Devanagari lipi) and found Mr. Krishna courteous and reliable. I am marking
a copy to Mr. Krishna so that he might respond immediately.

Best regards
N. Siva Senani

Greetings and salutations.
The publishers pay pal feature would not allow me to order with it. I
chatted with the owner of the book store.  He gave me his bank name and
particulars with respect to the exchange rate of $/Rs. I sent the required
amount in $ to his bank, but have not heard back yet. I intend to e-mail him
to inquire about his bank's receipt of my cheque.  Allow me to inform him
that others are interested, and I will report again.  I do not suppose it
would be out of order to post his e-mail address here:
samatabooks at gmail.com My intention was to have him send  "Complete Works of
Shankaracharya" also.
