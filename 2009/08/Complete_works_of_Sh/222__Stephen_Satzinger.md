Greetings and salutations.
The publishers pay pal feature would not allow me to order with it. I
chatted with the owner of the book store.  He gave me his bank name and
particulars with respect to the exchange rate of $/Rs. I sent the required
amount in $ to his bank, but have not heard back yet. I intend to e-mail him
to inquire about his bank's receipt of my cheque.  Allow me to inform him
that others are interested, and I will report again.  I do not suppose it
would be out of order to post his e-mail address here:
samatabooks at gmail.com My intention was to have him send  "Complete Works of
Shankaracharya" also.
