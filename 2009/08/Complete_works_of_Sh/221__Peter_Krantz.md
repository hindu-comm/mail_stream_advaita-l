Hari Om,

We placed our order a few weeks ago, and within a day, received directions
for direct transfer of funds to Samata Books' bank account.  Having thus
paid, Samata Books subsequently advised that the books are on their way to
us, by our requested airmail.

Jai Shree Krishna.

Hari Om,

Apologies for having replied to myself, but did anyone hear back from Samata
books?

I tried to order complete works and 2 other books online, but it asked for
paypal account and so, I'd to shelve the order. Instead I wrote to them and
am waiting for their directions on ordering the same. Of course, its been
just 3-4 days and may be its just a routine process taking its time.

Thanks,
