Dear Anjana,
If you know Kananda, I have some material in Kannada.
Regards,
K. Ramakrishna

Subject: [Advaita-l] Leadership in Ancient Indian texts

Thank you all for the useful information regarding my research

I am planning to focus on Western theories of leadership such as
transformational, charismatic, spiritual and servant styles and contrast
these with ancient icons from the Itihasas and other relevant texts.

Unfortunately, I am still in the process of learning Sanskrit, so would
require the texts to be available in English.

Kindest regards, 

Anjana
