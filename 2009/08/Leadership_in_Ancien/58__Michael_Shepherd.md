Anjanaji,

I have little to offer to you -- but since you mention Western theories,
then, on the spiritual side, I think one of the few Western models worthy of
attention is the monastic system : which so closely mirrors the Bhagavad
Gita in the inculcation of real spiritual leadership..

Michael

Subject: [Advaita-l] Leadership in Ancient Indian texts



Thank you all for the useful information regarding my research

I am planning to focus on Western theories of leadership such as
transformational, charismatic, spiritual and servant styles and contrast
these with ancient icons from the Itihasas and other relevant texts.

Unfortunately, I am still in the process of learning Sanskrit, so would
require the texts to be available in English.

Kindest regards,

Anjana
