Thank you all for the useful information regarding my research

I am planning to focus on Western theories of leadership such as transformational, charismatic, spiritual and servant styles and contrast these with ancient icons from the Itihasas and other relevant texts.

Unfortunately, I am still in the process of learning Sanskrit, so would require the texts to be available in English.

Kindest regards, 

Anjana
