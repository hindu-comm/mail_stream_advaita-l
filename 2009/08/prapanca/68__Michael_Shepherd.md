PS The Panchadasi chapter Two spells all this out, incorporating the 3 v 5
aspect.. I'm still reading it.

Thank you, Sunil and Chekakara and Naresh..

I've just whizzed through the Siddhantabindu where there is noted 'The mind
is the sattvika portion of the five elements'.. so this quintuplication
seems to be the clue..

Prapanca is usually defined as 'the phenomenal world' and viswa and sarva
are usually taken to be 'the All'. So it's open to question whether they can
be described as synonymous. From the mahavakya, I suspect not..

So this does seem to connect all the meanings offered : and it does seem, as
the sages say, that we can and should resist the proliferation in our mind;
as Advaita and vyati-reka support. I'm happy to have passed through the
'either-or' aspect of prapanca -- though obviously, there's more to
understand there..

Thanks to all.

Michael

Friends,

Yes "pra' prefix is for reinforcing or emphasising. For example in
"Pranava"the prefix of "pra"is added to"nava" ie new and the word
"Pranava" means the Eternal or ever new or ageless or beyond timeie. the
Brahman.

As regards the "vyaktikarana" how do you like the alternative explanation?
The "Avyakta" became Vyakta, through the process of vyaktikarana (ie
appeared through the five Sukshmabhutas and transforming them to the five
Mahabhutas) andthis is whatthe Prapanca implies.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

I consulted with bRuhaddhAtu and my dictionary regarding prapa~ncha and here
is what I found:

pa~nch dhAtu (verb root) has two meanings: vyaktee-karaNam (showing
differences) and vistAravachanam (denoting expanse). [Technically, pachi
vyaktee-karaNe, pachi vistaara-vachane.]
The prefix pra reinforces the meaning in either case. In sense of showing
difference prapa~ncha could be taken to mean something that shows
vareity/differences.
In the sense of highlighting differences, it also means samsaara (filled
with differences, etc.). Prapancha in the sense of denoting something big /
expansive is another meaning.

At any rate, none of my sources try to justify prapancha in the sense of
pa~nchan = five.

Moreover if one takes pa~ncha = five, then the pra won't be an upasarga at
all. Pra operates as an upsarga (verb prefix) only when it comes before
action words. Otherwise, pra may be termed an avyaya. But Dr. Yadu's remark
about pra being an upasarga is correct, but for the wrong reasons :)
Because pa~nch is a dhAtu, pra becomes an upasarga. Not because pa~ncha =
five.

Now we can construct words like aShTakam (e.g., toTakAShTakam). So
pa~nchakam would be a set of five. In that sense, perhaps we can use
prapa~nchakam as some important set of five elements.
