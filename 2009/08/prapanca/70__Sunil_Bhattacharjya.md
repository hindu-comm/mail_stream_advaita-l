Friends,

I think a five yard cloth piece used for wearing is also popularly called a Pancha.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Members
Pancha in sanskrit also has a meaning -a thing which has a broad 
mouth/opening.-Pancha patram means a vessel having a broad mouth.This is 
used for keeping water to do all rituals including Sandhya 
Vandhanam.Prapancham may therefore denote an expanse which is 
immeasurable.In all languages there are words which have different meanings 
and it is for us to fix the intended meaning which is more 
appropriate.Krishnamoorthy.
