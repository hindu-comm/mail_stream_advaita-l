Dear  Chelakara,

Thanks for that. I've found a brief reference to it in Banerji's book list
of tantra treatises.

Michael

Dear Michael:

To understand this term further one needs to did a litter deeper.

by trying to understand the meaning ofupasarga "pra" or sound "pra".

To me the sound "pra" suggests the meaning as -"The leading edge of
beginning"

If we take the abovemeaning and then try to analyze the suggested meaning
of various words our doubts get clarified.

To express a big project Sanskrit uses a term - "prakalpa" that defines the
scope of the project.

Take some more examples of uopasarga "pra": pra-vaasa, pra-Naya, pra-maaNa,
pratyaksha, pra-vachana ......... etc.Another word for OM is praNava.As
expressed by our ancestors OM was the beginning of everything including
understanding. "ometi pratipaaddyate etatviyajuH"

Incidental even in English language the sound"pra" seems to convey the same
meaning. Example: pre-fix, premier, prime-minister, pre-university,
preacher,

The second of the term"pra~nca" you are trying to understand is
straightforward, which suggests the five essential elements (tattva) for any
manifestation.

Hope this helps.

Kind Regards,

Dr. Yadu

'Pra-panca' is normally equated with the 'phenomenal appearance' of the
world. None of my immediate reference books give consideration to the
possibility that it implies it as being the appearance via the five
senses/elements.

Can anyone offer further references ?

Michael
