Maneesh Vyas

Dear Friend, born in Jaipur in 1971, I now live and work in Moscow in a CRO.
looking for suggestions and advice on discovering oneself with advaita -
vedanta dogmas.


Rajeev Kumar

Greetings !!!

I am Rajeev Kumar of age 36 yrs, married and with a child of 4 Yrs. Working
as a senior manager in an IT company and happy with my life in general.

I need to understand the basic concept of Adavaita. I am quite confused
after reading some of the article on Wikipedia.

Some of my basic thoughts which I will like to get addressed are

1. What actually Sankaracharaya meant by Gagat Mithya and Maya ?
2. Is there a God as per Advaita. Looking at the Wikipedia I am confused what
     Sankarachara view points were

3. Born in a Hindu family I am Hindu. But, should I worship all the Gods as
    being practiced in modern Hinduism ? Is there some thoughts from Advaita for
    home dwellers? As a family man what should be my conduct/religious
    practices.

    I certainly have more questions, but I guess this should be a good starting
    point and depending upon the responses I will receive I will post my further
    questions

    Will be very appreciative of any guidance provided on my above questions.

    Sincerely,

    Rajeev
