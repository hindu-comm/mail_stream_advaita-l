Good point, Sri Anbu.

Your interpretation of Bhagawan Ramana's SlOkam to support varNa vyavastha
is wonderful. This shows how universally applicable, the words of
brahma-jnaani-s are!!
(There was a question in another thread whether scientific theories are
universally applicable, incidentally :-) )

Elaborating what you said..
We should look at the fact that occupation is just one transient aspect of
life. Being born as a braamhaNa is a much fundamental, largely unchanging,
aspect and for that reason one should stick to the vihita-karma-anushThaana
to the extent possible. Birth is a chance given by God to "advance" towards
chitta-Sudhdhi. The jeeva "progresses" in this path not by occupation but by
vihita-karma-anushThaana with vairaagyam (which cleanses and erazes
karma-bandham.)

Best Regards,
-Sarma KV
