Besides the point, Sir, we're hardly discussing other religions and
conversions here!
At least not me. In any case, studies in other religions do not interest me,
since in my
lifetime, I find myself short of learning and following my svadharma.
Moreover,
(most) people in other religions themselves would not be interested in how
Vedas
define their varNa, would they?

This is, as usual, half the story told, AFAIK. The varNas indicate the
distinctness
among them, alright. But from where do they get such distinctive features?
By birth,
I suppose, since you say these features manifest within. Now, isn't that
prArabdha
due to purva karma? I understand so, and precisely the reason that such a
distinctive
feature is seen in a respective distinctive varNa's family where the person
is born.

You may well subscribe to that view, I do not please. Even within Hinduism,
I hold
the traditional viewpoint that a person born in a Brahmin family becomes a
dvija
only after the upanayana saMskAra and remains so as long as he follows his
svadharma.

No, sorry, I do not. To me, varNa binds me to dharma and with that, there
must
be dharma in varNa, thats where svadharma comes from!


PS: I'm not sure which mail of mine you replied this too, I'd merely quoted
the
great Paramacharya of Kanchi.

Thanks much,
