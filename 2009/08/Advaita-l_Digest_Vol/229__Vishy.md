Dear Shankar


You are right, but with one correction.... All of us are not shdhrs as theyaim is said to besaid to be only serving the society without bargaining for anything inreturn, but all all of us can be branded (including those who are born shudras) as vysyas whoo trade sell some thing inreturn .... ya, we sell ourselves(in the name of services) for negotiated price (call it cooli / salary/ wage whatever).

In that way if we look in there are no Brakmanas, Kshatriyas or shudras anymore 
anywhere

Yes, we are and I believe everyone in this era are so. since very few are
following there respective varna dharma.

Most of work and get paid for livelihood. and do get alms for the same.
Hence I assume we are all shudras.

Shankar.
