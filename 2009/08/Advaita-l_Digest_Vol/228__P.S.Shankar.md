Dr.Yadu Moharir -  Wrote >>>

"I know all of us though born in Brahman families and have undergone
upanayana samskaraara, did sandhyaavadanama,?do?clean toilets in US?need to
be classified as?"shudra" !!

Yes, we are and I believe everyone in this era are so. since very few are
following there respective varna dharma.

Most of work and get paid for livelihood. and do  get alms for the same.
Hence I assume we are all shudras.

Shankar.
