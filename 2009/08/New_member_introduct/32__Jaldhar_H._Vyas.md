Kaustubh

I am pursuing Masters in Mechanical Engineering at the University of
Florida, Gainesville, FL USA. I hail from India.

I am 26. All these years I had been interested in the nature of life and
gradually I was drawn towards knowing it through the Sanatan Dharma.
I have been exploring on the different philosophies and trying to trace back
their developments. I stopped tracing back when I learned that these are
basically two philosophies, Advaita Vedanta and others. These days I am
trying to read as much possible about Vedanta, esp. Advaita. Also I am
seeking learned individuals who can guide my in this journey.
