The word pranava has different spelling in Sanskrit.Na has to be pronounced 
with a thick na and not with  the tip of the tongue touching the upper 
teeth.Like phana denoting a snake.A small difference in pronounciation will 
alter the meaning differently.Navam also means 9.Let us not indulge in 
distortion of the intended meanings.One more point beejaksharas have no 
meaning in the sense that words carry meaning.they are original sounds 
emanated from the Divine is the belief of the forefathers.Pada chedham or 
separating the vowels and consonats also may vary.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Subject: [Advaita-l] praNava


Namaste,

Shri Bhattacharjya's interpretation of praNava = pra + nava is very 
interesting.
Any more comments/ references on this?

Regards,
Shrinivas

Friends,

Yes "pra' prefix is for reinforcing or emphasising. For example in "Pranava" 
the prefix of "pra" is added to
"nava" ie new and the word "Pranava" means the Eternal or ever new or 
ageless or beyond time ie.
the Brahman.
