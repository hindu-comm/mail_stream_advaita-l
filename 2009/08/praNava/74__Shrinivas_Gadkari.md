Namaste,

Shri Bhattacharjya's interpretation of praNava = pra + nava is very interesting.
Any more comments/ references on this?

Regards,
Shrinivas

Friends,

Yes "pra' prefix is for reinforcing or emphasising. For example in "Pranava" the prefix of "pra" is added to 
"nava" ie new and the word "Pranava" means the Eternal or ever new or ageless or beyond time ie. 
the Brahman.
