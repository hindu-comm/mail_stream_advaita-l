In pra + nava the na changes to Na (Na as in karNa). The basic rule is that
this change is effected when there is a "ra" or "Sha" (as in ShaShThI)
sound. But there are several corollaries to this. Way out of the scope of
the list. Interested readers may refer "Natva-Nijantam" published by
Samskrita Bharati.


Secondly I think we need to be a little careful in trying to derive words
because it sounds like something. After all "pronoun" sounds like praNava :)
