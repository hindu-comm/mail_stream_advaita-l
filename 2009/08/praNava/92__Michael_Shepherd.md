Namaste,

My own feeling, every time I meet the suffixes pra- or para- , is that their
'intention' is to point towards that which is unsayable.

So they sometimes appear almost unnecessary : e.g. how can a 'paramatman'
exist when atman is ultimate in itself ?

So whether 'full of' or 'beyond' or 'pointing towards', the verbal intention
is transcendent.

This may be a very personal interpretation; but I find it practical; so that
when saying, for instance, Om paramatmane namah, I don't have to try to
engage my imagination over 'paramatman' !

Michael

Namaste,

Until now we have three additional interpretations of praNava as being
derived from:
1. pra + nava
2. pra + nu (praise)
3. pravaNa - to slide towars something
4. praNAma - surrender

To pin down the most relevant meaning, we also need to consider that
praNava and prANa are closely related.

To inquire from another angle, how do we dervive the meaning of prANa?

Regards,
Shrinivas

Namaste,

Shri Bhattacharjya's interpretation of praNava = pra + nava is very
interesting.
Any more comments/ references on this?

Regards,
Shrinivas

Friends,

Yes "pra' prefix is for reinforcing or emphasising. For example in "Pranava"
the prefix of "pra" is added to
"nava" ie new and the word "Pranava" means the Eternal or ever new or
ageless or beyond time ie.
the Brahman.
