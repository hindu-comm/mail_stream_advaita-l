Namaste Sunil-Ji:

If one looks bhakti asan extension of the "aham brahmaashi".

Then this becomes the equilliser "we and theGod"are the same. 

So by serving the concept of "God / Ishvra" we the Human beings will not abuse the nature or other beings and that would be the real Ishaara seva.

Through this we will be making our own place better not only for ourselves but for the society (immediate community or Nation)we live in.

Then "we" the individual citizens automatically become the "Bharata bhaagya vidhtaa" rather than "George the 4th".

Bhakti has lead us to remain harbour serving mentality in our personal and professional lives. The current understanding of bhakti is extremely selfish for personal benefits only. Where the upasaka desires / wishes for "individual salvation / liberation" rather than liberating the whole community / Nation. That is what is meant or needs to to realized from thephrase "pradubhotosiraaShTesmin kirtiR^iddhi dadhaatu me" (shri suukta).

Just something to think about !!

Kind regards,

Dr. Yadu

Dear Yaduji,

"Undivided in the Divided" is Sattvic knowledge. It is the true Jnana or Knowledge alright. But I am a bit cautious about the use of the term Bhakti in the ultimate state as it will mean thatthe Lord loves Himself (the Lord).Another way of looking atbhakti isthat bhakti is a state of the mind and it belongs to Prakriti. It propels us to reach the Lord and then it becomes redundant or it is left behind.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Sada-Ji:

Thanks, my memory often fails with a block.

I am also having the same problem. I do not get the postings I have to go the web site to view. May be we need to ask Jaldhar-ji for advise.

This concept of "avibhaktam vibhakteShu" is probably my most favorite concept of applying advaita in daily life as explained in "raamacharti manas".

Just imagine if one starts applying this principle as an individual bhakta and serving the society and environment as bhagavan? Would that not make a heaven on this Earth ?

Kind regards,

Yadunath
