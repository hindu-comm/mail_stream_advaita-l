Namaste,

I should have mentioned this point in my earlier posts.
Your observation that praNava has sound N and
not n is correct. I am no expert on Sanskrit grammar.
However, being a part of this email list has enabled
me to pick up some grammar rules. One such rule
changes a "n" to "N" when preceded by "r" sound.
So praNava = pra + nava is a valid break up.

Can someone explain this rule in more details?

Also on bIja akshara-s, I firmly believe that by prolonged
contemplation on individual sounds making up the 
bIja akshara-s we can start to understand the meaning
latent in them.

Regards,
Shrinivas

The word pranava has different spelling in Sanskrit.Na has to be pronounced 
with a thick na and not with the tip of the tongue touching the upper 
teeth.Like phana denoting a snake.A small difference in pronounciation will 
alter the meaning differently.Navam also means 9.Let us not indulge in 
distortion of the intended meanings.One more point beejaksharas have no 
meaning in the sense that words carry meaning.they are original sounds 
emanated from the Divine is the belief of the forefathers.Pada chedham or 
separating the vowels and consonats also may vary.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Namaste,
Shri Bhattacharjya's interpretation of praNava = pra + nava is very 
interesting.
Any more comments/ references on this?
Regards,
Shrinivas
