Namaste,

Until now we have three additional interpretations of praNava as being
derived from:
1. pra + nava
2. pra + nu (praise)
3. pravaNa - to slide towars something
4. praNAma - surrender

To pin down the most relevant meaning, we also need to consider that
praNava and prANa are closely related. 

To inquire from another angle, how do we dervive the meaning of prANa?

Regards,
Shrinivas

Namaste,

Shri Bhattacharjya's interpretation of praNava = pra + nava is very interesting.
Any more comments/ references on this?

Regards,
Shrinivas

Friends,

Yes "pra' prefix is for reinforcing or emphasising. For example in "Pranava" the prefix of "pra" is added to 
"nava" ie new and the word "Pranava" means the Eternal or ever new or ageless or beyond time ie. 
the Brahman.
