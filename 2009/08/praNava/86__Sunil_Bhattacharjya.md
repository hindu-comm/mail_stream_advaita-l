Dear Yaduji,

"Undivided in the Divided" is Sattvic knowledge. It is the true Jnana or Knowledge alright. But I am a bit cautious about the use of the term Bhakti in the ultimate state as it will mean thatthe Lord loves Himself (the Lord).Another way of looking atbhakti isthat bhakti is a state of the mind and it belongs to Prakriti. It propels us to reach the Lord and then it becomes redundant or it is left behind.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Sada-Ji:

Thanks, my memory often fails with a block.

I am also having the same problem. I do not get the postings I have to go the web site to view. May be we need to ask Jaldhar-ji for advise.

This concept of "avibhaktam vibhakteShu" is probably my most favorite concept of applying advaita in daily life as explained in "raamacharti manas".

Just imagine if one starts applying this principle as an individual bhakta and serving the society and environment as bhagavan? Would that not make a heaven on this Earth ?

Kind regards,

Yadunath

Yaduji - PraNAms


avibhaktam vibhakteShu occurs in Giita 18-20 as part of saatvika guNa.

Hari Om!
