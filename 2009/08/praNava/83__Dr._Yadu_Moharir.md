Namste Sunil-Ji:

The concept of"avibhakta.n vibhakteshhu"is relevent here from advaitic point of view.

As I recall, the reference you have mentioned is from discssion between Rama and Hanumana

There is a dohaa in Tulsidaasaa's "raamacharita manasa" that pertains to the concept of "ananya bhakti"

so ananya jaake.n asi mati na Tarai hanuma.nta |
mai sevaka sa caraacara ruupa svaami bhagava.nta || kiShkindhaakaaNDa 3 ||

Regards,

Dr. Yadu

Dear friends,

Dvaitya is Saameepya Mukti and Advaita is Saayujya Mukti, even when we talk in terms of the Saguna Brahman. Remember the reported statement of Hanuman that as an embodied beinghe is the servant of Lord Rama (the Dvaita concept), as aJiva he is a part of the Lord (yet separate, ie the Visistadvaita concept) and from theangle of realisationofthe Atman he is the Lord Himself (the Advaita concept).

Any comment?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

I fail to understand your question. Om Namah Shivaya is dvaita, though traditionally dvaitists are vaishnavites. In dvaita jivatma is separate from paramatma, and at the time of kaivalyam it merges into Vishnu or Shiva. That is my understanding. Abrahamic surrender does not lead to such merger (I have heard of bent knees in case when a king conquers the world, but not in case of dealing with paramatma). I like to learn from list members if that is not the case. 



Regards

Bhadraiah
