Namaste,

The common derivation for pranava as synonymous (more or less...) for omkara
or udgitha is from the dhatu nu, to praise.

It has acquired a subsidiary dictionary definition as pranava 'mutter the
omkara'..

Perhaps Nareshcould help here ?

Michael

Namaste,

Shri Bhattacharjya's interpretation of praNava = pra + nava is very
interesting.
Any more comments/ references on this?

Regards,
Shrinivas

Friends,

Yes "pra' prefix is for reinforcing or emphasising. For example in "Pranava"
the prefix of "pra" is added to
"nava" ie new and the word "Pranava" means the Eternal or ever new or
ageless or beyond time ie.
the Brahman.
