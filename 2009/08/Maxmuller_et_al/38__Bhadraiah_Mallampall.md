Dear Michael,



If you have read Mahabharata, you will realize that Maxmuller is no different from any other kuru warrior. Assuming he was a good hearted person and all documentation against him (or for that matter McCaulay) was fabricated, he was still working for an evil establishment. The western systems have their own "architecture" in which many good persons are employed to achieve an ultimate adharmic goal.  



On deeper inquiry it is not appropriate to compare Maxmuller with kuru warriors. Bhishma at one time honesly suggested to Dhrtarashtra that Duryodhana be executed for the conspiracy to kill pandavas. Maxmuller may not have taught clergy, but he knew his research could be used for other purposes, and somebody else did followed up based on his research. Secularism - separation of faith and administration - is only on paper to make sure same person is not publicly involved in conflicing activities. As in the case of Shrouta, in cases like this you have to weave through the infrastructure to realize the truth. 



Regards

Bhadraiah
