Dear Michaelji,

Namaste,

Yes in the Vedatrayee there is yajna and the priests are differently called in each of the three vedas. In the fourth Veda ie. the Atharva Veda where Lord Brhma himself is the priest. In the fifth veda, ie. in the puranas, there is, of course, no priest. May be some of the scholarts of our forum may like to throw more light on this.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Krishna,

Namaste. While yajna is defined as 'worship, sacrifice', extended to the
five great obligatory sacrifices of the dvija, the prime definition of homa
is 'pouring into the fire'. The older, more formal ceremony of offering
oblations as in the RgVeda was the 'hotra' with its designated classes of
priest.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Yajna and Homa



Dear members,

I have a question.

What is the difference between a yajna and a homa? Is it the scale? Or is
it the type of offering (gheeversus others)or the mantras or purpose
(kaamya karma versus loka kalyana)? Yajna seems to have a broader meaning
than fire ritual, but homa is strictly a fire ritual.

If this has been discussed before, can you please forward me the link?

With regards,
Krishna
