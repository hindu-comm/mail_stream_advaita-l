Dear Jaldharji,

Kindly permit me to quote my own statement:

Quote

 In the fourth Veda ie. the Atharva Veda where Lord Brahma himself is the priest.

Unquote

How will you then rewrite the above? Is it done on behalf of Lord Brahmaa, the Saguna Brahman?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Actually it is the other way round. It is the Yajna with Vashatkara which makes up the shrauta sacrifices which require atleast 4 Brahmanas.

The homas with svahakar are typically less elaborate and are either auxilliaries of the shrauta rites or make up the grhya or "household" rites which require either one Brahmana or are done by the sacrificer himself. (And to add to the confusion these include the panchamahayajnas you mentioned.)

Brahma or brAhmaNa in this context has nothing to do with brahma prajApati. Perhaps it should be translated as "wielder" or "director" of sacred speech.
