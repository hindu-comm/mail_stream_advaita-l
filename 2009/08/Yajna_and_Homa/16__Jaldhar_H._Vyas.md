Sorry for the late response but I wanted to add one more thing.  It is a 
bit of a stretch to say yajnas neccessarily were public and for the 
collective good.  As you point out there are counter-examples.  The 
dividing line between the Shrauta and Grhya rituals is that the former 
were performed by kings and other wealthy people while the latter, as 
their name suggests, were domestic and performed by the ordinary people. 
Our culture stresses the importance of hospitality so if a rich man was to 
perform a a yajna it might have tended to become a public event for that 
reason even if the letter of the rules did not absolutely require it.
