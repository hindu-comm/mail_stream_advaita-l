I'm not sure I understand the question.  Mantras in all four vedas are 
addressed to different devatas including to Prajapati.  Whether to see 
those devatas as many or aspects of one depends on the mentality of the 
viewer.  Advaita Vedanta definitely encourages the latter view.  None of 
this has anything to do with the priests employed in a shrauta yajna as 
far as I can tell.
