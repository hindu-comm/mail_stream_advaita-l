Krishna,

Namaste. While yajna is defined as 'worship, sacrifice', extended to the
five great obligatory sacrifices of the dvija, the prime definition of homa
is 'pouring into the fire'. The older, more formal ceremony of offering
oblations as in the RgVeda was the 'hotra' with its designated classes of
priest.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Yajna and Homa



Dear members,

I have a question.

What is the difference between a yajna and a homa? Is it the scale? Or is
it the type of offering (gheeversus others)or the mantras or purpose
(kaamya karma versus loka kalyana)? Yajna seems to have a broader meaning
than fire ritual, but homa is strictly a fire ritual.

If this has been discussed before, can you please forward me the link?

With regards,
Krishna
