Dear members,

I have a question. 

What is the difference between a yajna and a homa? Is it the scale? Or is it the type of offering (gheeversus others)or the mantras or purpose (kaamya karma versus loka kalyana)? Yajna seems to have a broader meaning than fire ritual, but homa is strictly a fire ritual.

If this has been discussed before, can you please forward me the link?

With regards, 
Krishna
