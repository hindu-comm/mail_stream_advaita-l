Actually it is the other way round.  It is the Yajna with Vashatkara which 
makes up the shrauta sacrifices which require atleast 4 Brahmanas.

The homas with svahakar are typically less elaborate and are either 
auxilliaries of the shrauta rites or make up the grhya or "household" 
rites which require either one Brahmana or are done by the sacrificer 
himself.  (And to add to the confusion these include the panchamahayajnas 
you mentioned.)

Brahma or brAhmaNa in this context has nothing to do with brahma 
prajApati.  Perhaps it should be translated as "wielder" or "director" of 
sacred speech.
