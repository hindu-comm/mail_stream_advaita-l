Dear Dr Yadu,

devatoddeshena dravyatyaagaH

Brilliant exposition.

But the meaning of dravya in the passage quoted
above is not [ at least may not be ] money,
it is just any 'material'
that is qualified to be/marked for an offering.





SrIramaNArpaNamastu





sarvE bhavanthu sukhinah
sarvE santhu niraamayaah
sarve bhadrANi pasyanthu
maa kaschit duhkhabhAg bhavEt.
