Mihaelji,

Yes, Prakashananda Saraswatijisays in page 491 of that book, as follows:

Quote

Shankaracharya, after establishing the main four maths and spreading the greatness of Sanatana Dharm, came back to South india and for the last four to six years of his life helived in Kanchi Kamakoti. Thus, Kanchi Kamakoti is also called the fifth math.

Unquote

This is my perception too. Adi Sankaracharya reportedly called Sureshwaracharya to take care of and guide the young initiate, who was put in charge of the Kanchi Kamakoti math just beforehis death.This also suggests that initially Kanchi Kamakoti math was more like a branch of the Sringeri math, till they had to sever the tie when the political relationship of the two zones of location of the two maths deteriorated. Then the Kanchi kamakoti math had to declare independence and subsequently due to some political troublte the math had to be shifted to Kumbhakonam for quite a long time, till it returned to Kanchi Kamakoti.Thus it may be a fact that the Samadhi (ie. the burial place)of Shri Sureshvaracharyaisin Kanchi Kamakoti.But has this been corroborated by the record of the Sringeri math ordoes the Sringeri math have any alternative location for the Samadhi-sthal of Shri Sureshvaracharya?

Secondly everybody agrees that Shri suraeshvaracharya was appointed as the pontiff of the Sringeri math. Why then the Kudali-Sringeri claims that it is the real Sringeri and that Swami Vidyasankara was also the Mathadhipati of that math? When a Muslim general attacked the region then Vidyasankara swamihad to leaveKudali Sringeri and there is a monument (not samadhi) therein memory of him. The Sringeri math toohas a monumentin memory of Vidyasankara Swami but not his samadhi-sthal. The big question is where is the Samadhi-sthal of Vidyasankara Swami located?

The Sringeri record regarding the Samadhi-sthals of Shri Sureshvaracharya and Vidyasankara swami will unravel these mysteries.

Sunil ji,

Prakashanand Saraswati has done his best to assemble the evidence or lack of
it in his 2001 book 'The true history and the religion of India'. Some of
the relevant section can be googled onscreen...

Dear friends,

Apart from the rival claims of two places for having the burial place of Adi
Sankaracharya there seems to be some confusion regarding the affiliated
Muttsof the two later great Advaita Acharyas. Hope this will be of
interest to you all the members of the list.

Firstly it is about Shri Sureshvaracharya. He was the first pontiff of the
Sringeri Mutt, apointed by Adi Sankaracharya himself. I also understand the
the Sringeri Mutt has the details of theburial-places ofall the past
Mathadhipatis.Then the Kudali Mutt (also called the Kudali-Sringeri
Mutt)claims to have had him with that Mutt. The Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt even
went further to claim that they have the burialplace of Shri
Sureshvaracharya inKanchi and the place is still preserved. Has any of the
learned members thought about this confusion as to where exactly is the real
burial place of Shri Sureshvaracharya?

Similarly both the Sringeri and the Kudali Mutts claim to have had
Vidyasankara Swami with them and there are monuments dedicated to him in
both the places.How can that happen?Is any learned member aware of any
research done on this?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharya
