Dear friends,

Apart from the rival claims of two places for having the burial place of Adi Sankaracharya there seems to be some confusion regarding the affiliated Muttsof the two later great Advaita Acharyas. Hope this will be of interest to you all the members of the list.

Firstly it is about Shri Sureshvaracharya. He was the first pontiff of the Sringeri Mutt, apointed by Adi Sankaracharya himself. I also understand the the Sringeri Mutt has the details of theburial-places ofall the past Mathadhipatis.Then the Kudali Mutt (also called the Kudali-Sringeri Mutt)claims to have had him with that Mutt. The Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt even went further to claim that they have the burialplace of Shri Sureshvaracharya inKanchi and the place is still preserved. Has any of the learned members thought about this confusion as to where exactly is the real burial place of Shri Sureshvaracharya? 

Similarly both the Sringeri and the Kudali Mutts claim to have had Vidyasankara Swami with them and there are monuments dedicated to him in both the places.How can that happen?Is any learned member aware of any research done on this?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharya
