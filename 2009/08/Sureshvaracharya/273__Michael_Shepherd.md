Sunil ji,

Prakashanand Saraswati has done his best to assemble the evidence or lack of
it in his 2001 book 'The true history and the religion of India'. Some of
the relevant section can be googled onscreen...

Michael

Dear friends,

Apart from the rival claims of two places for having the burial place of Adi
Sankaracharya there seems to be some confusion regarding the affiliated
Muttsof the two later great Advaita Acharyas. Hope this will be of
interest to you all the members of the list.

Firstly it is about Shri Sureshvaracharya. He was the first pontiff of the
Sringeri Mutt, apointed by Adi Sankaracharya himself. I also understand the
the Sringeri Mutt has the details of theburial-places ofall the past
Mathadhipatis.Then the Kudali Mutt (also called the Kudali-Sringeri
Mutt)claims to have had him with that Mutt. The Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt even
went further to claim that they have the burialplace of Shri
Sureshvaracharya inKanchi and the place is still preserved. Has any of the
learned members thought about this confusion as to where exactly is the real
burial place of Shri Sureshvaracharya?

Similarly both the Sringeri and the Kudali Mutts claim to have had
Vidyasankara Swami with them and there are monuments dedicated to him in
both the places.How can that happen?Is any learned member aware of any
research done on this?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharya
