You raised this question about Mercury in this forum and others, a couple of years back and I gave an exact quotation from the rasa hR^idaya tantra showing that the ancients are quite aware of the toxic qualities of Hg.

That is followed by a warning of the effects of coming in touch with it without taking proper precautions. Because of its toxic properties house holders are not supposed to worship a Mercury linga, atleast in one of my teacher's tradition.

I belong to a smArta sAmpradAya, my teachers being smArta-s and I am notconnected to any tAntrIka tradition.

So the blame is shifted to kShatriya's now. :)
