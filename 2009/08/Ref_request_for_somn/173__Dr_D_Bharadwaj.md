Dr Yadu's post was deplorable. Besides personal prejudice and
bitterness, Brahmana bashing is a fashion these days. So much for the
scholarship and 'understanding'!!

One cannot claim that there is an unopposed universal agreement that the
mind's understanding is more important than the vibratory event of reciting
in the right manner. A lot can be said about the importance of overcoming
the ignorant, arrogant, limited, sense-imprisoned, semi blind mind and
its overbearing claim to 'understanding' what is beyond it.

In the first place, it has not been established with finality that the
understanding is more important.How is the 'understanding', that is limited
to kAla and dESa, unquestionably more important than the vibratory essence
of pristine recitation? According to whom? What is the pramANa for the
claim? If there is a authenticated premise, it may worthy of further
discussion. If it is just the reason -buttressed kalpana  of the mind of the
learned member without any valid pramANa, then the same may be ignored.

Secondly, even if we grant for the moment that the understanding is more
important, how does it follow that the   brahmana is inferior for that
reason? Is there a class or a varga of people other than the brahmana that
excelled in the 'understanding' better than the merely reciting brahmana??

Thirdly, even the 'other-than-a-brahmana', all poised to surpass in the
superior act of 'understanding', is obliged to depend on the inferior
indispensible reciting individual, brahmana or not. How many of these
members of the superior class, varga have contributed till now to the
survival of the Dharma with their important understanding?? Who are they?
What was the contribution?? What was their uniquely important
'understanding'?? If the reciting brahmanas are 'dead pillars' then what are
they?? Some other structure that can replace a pillars, dead or live?
