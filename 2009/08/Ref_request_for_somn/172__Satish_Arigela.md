Do you have a reference for this? Like perhaps a chronicle or maybe some later day write up on this event? Or is this your imagination? You talk as if you were there in the temple during the invasion.

Nowhere through out the history of India did vaidika-s or tAntrika-s are known to display the kind of mentality you mention. Rites of ward off calamities were performed, but in all the historical cases that I am aware of, where such rites were performed, they are followed(or in parallel)up by military(or other required)action.

Why do you frequently indulge in this brAhmaNa bashing on various forums? I will bluntly say that it is a very ugly habit.

Against many odds the brAhmaNa-s did what they could and preserved what they can...one can be eitherthankful or just keep mum.

When resources are not available to understand..simply learning to recite is enough.. ofcourse understanding(which is equally imp)would be an added advantage.

Namaste:

Yes, Hinduism survived but that is purely academic as Brahmin's remained as lifeless pillars that supported the roof.

When Mohd.. Gajhani attacked Somanath temple Brahmins recited"Mahaarudra" and requested Shiva to open his "third" eye. The third for Shiva is supposed to be "j~naana chakhsu" to burn ignorance. When are we going to admit that it was the "Blind-Faith" on deities and Brahmin's that wanted to keep their importance in the society were primarily responsible for loss of our vedic knowledge as they remain the donkeys carryiong the weight of sandlewood.

The number of Moron Sadhu's visiting US are hiding behind the the term "shaddhaa" and propagate Mysticism to line their own pockets for profit.

I have absolute no regard to the folks who promote recitation instead of understanding.

We rather remain slaves than become Gods and create heaven on this Earth. The concept for preferroing to remain "daasa" is clearly found in R^igveda as we want someone (deities)else to make us rich by remaining "daasa" (shuudra).

The latest fashion is that Sanskrit is great for Computers, but does anyone seriously think whether programmers are ever going to learn Sanskrit before programming ? This is just a feel good thing !? So much for Brahmin's. 

I know all of us though born in Brahman families and have undergone upanayana samskaraara, did sandhyaavadanama,doclean toilets in USneed to be classified as"shudra" !!

How about the scholars opinion that Hinduism survived the onslaught of the Muslim invasions and rule because of the Brahmins?

It means you ought to study the impact of Buddhism instead of being biased
in its favour!
If a condition in India gave rise to Buddhism, then there are two resulting
situations considering that Buddhism declined in India.

One is that the need gets fulfilled and Buddhism served its purpose. Did
it?

The other is like a condition that gives rise to the weed in a field which
condition gets rectified and the weeds are out. Here Buddhism is compared
to the weed.

You have to determine which one of this was the result.

Under Buddhism the role of Brahmins as an entity was unneeded as much as it
is under Hinduism. When something is not needed it will not exist.
