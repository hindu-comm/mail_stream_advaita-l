NamastePraveenji,

Parashuarama's exterminating the kshatriyas some twenty one times isnot to be taken literally. Heleda number of expeditions against the kshatriyas to control their unruly behaviour. King Kartaviryarjuna became a megalomaniac and he needed to be disciplined. Yet he (Parashurama acceptedthe Shantanu-nandan Bhishma, who was a kshatriya and taught him all that he knew about the use weapons.

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Did Parashuram, about whom and his lineage is said "shApAdapi sharAdapi",
destroy kshatriyAs in a different way the 21st time than the earlier 20
times? I guess not, because there were still Kshatriyas after it. Even then,
he was troubled that he couldn't win over Rama and went to Dattatraya to
learn what has come about as Tripura Rahasya, a wonderful teaching indeed!

Is that the fault that lies solely with Brahmins or is it of those
Kshatriyas that survived after the 21st assault of Parashuram? Somehow, from
talking of "lifeless pillars" that Brahmins were quoted to be, you seem to
attack a wider range of ancestors now!

If our ancestors were napu~sakas, there wouldn't have been a language for
even Westerners to study...

... let alone sampradAya to "hide behind"! Perhaps a better approach for
most of us would be to stop this self-pity of a past no one seems to agree
upon, thankless to the rich Indian culture that is somehow preserved with so
many pains that our ancestors took, and walk on the traditional path
instead, inasmuch as is possible.

I assume these were other than those ancestors that you indicated.

I don't think neti-neti helps in "utility the real purpose" or has
"implication to larger masses"? Am I wrong in finding it contradictory here?
