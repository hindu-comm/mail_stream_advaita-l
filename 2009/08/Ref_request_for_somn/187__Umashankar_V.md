Dear Dr.Yadu,
I want to re-iterate one another fact and bring it to your notice. There is
a technical matter involved in why the Brahmins must not fight.

Brahmins invoke the Divine and do a lot of practices everyday to this
effect. They recite "Loka Samastha Sukhino Bhavatu". They are there to
invoke Grace for whole society and thats the original Brahmin dharma
according to Varnasrama dharma. Given that as the true basis, Brahmins have
certain stringent adherences. They should not lose their equanimity and must
win over their senses. This is not because of any dogma of rule, but this
happens to them as their way of life, naturally. That's how the beautiful
Vedic society was defined and the Varnasrama dharma was setup.

Such a Brahmin, if he slips into emotions , the power of his anushtanas will
also be with him and anything he does in a state on emotion will, he will
unleash all that power. He then becomes a fallen "brashta" Brahmana. A good
Brahmin is like a cow, very Divine. A fallen one is worse than the worst as
he carries all his power with the bad that he accompanies it.

The wrath of a true Brahmin is much worse than the most deadliest weapons of
a great Kshatriya. This the brahmin knows. It is a fall from his state of
equanimity (equanimity is a Brahmin's dharma) to be shaken by outward
movements.

So, in the interest of the world and himself, given his spiritual pursuit,
it is only dharmic and right rather to be rooted deeply in Self, to have
nerves of steel and invoke the Grace of The Lord. It is not an ordinary and
an easy task to do when seeing his most favourite deity to be attacked, but
thats what by far the best a Brahmin can do and must do - invoke the Grace
of the Divine and NOT fall by taking up ARMS!!

*Remember *- It is a Brahmin who taught the Pandavas
*Remember* - Chanakya is a Brahmin
*Remember *- It is a Brahma Jnani who taught Sri Rama and a Brahma Jnani who
was kula-guru for entire Ikshvaku dynasty
*Remember* - It was a brahmin, a Rshi who taught Astra Vidya to Bheeshma and
Karna
*Remember *- A Brahmana+Kshatriya - Sri Rama  manifested to Kill Ravana. A
power of highest order was necessary to do that and the kshatriya had to be
a Brahma Jnani to do it.
*Remember* - Sri Janaka maharaja a Brahma Jnani fathered Mother Sita.
*Remember* - It was a simple and a humble brahmin - Sri Vasishta ganapati
Muni, who accidentally unleashed an astra ina fit of anger which ahd to be
contained by a Brahma Jnani, Sri Ramana Maharshi.

Still want Brahmins to take up ARMS!!??  Only fools can think so!

It is very easy to throw tantrums and run about in fear or anger and act
like a fool in 'Rajas'. Given the place-principle-role awareness, what the
Brahmins did is only right, *even if it had actually happened. *

Also, I request not to take such gory and extreme instances, for the purpose
of winning arguments, as they can only be reconciled in one's Soul
temperament and may not find any resolution through mere intellectual
discussions. These are painful instances in the history of earth. Do not
revisit them unless there is a solid positive outcome. Wielding or weaving
such arguments shows to what extent human ego can go. Everyone needs the
Grace of The Lord. Everyone gets it. Lets become more and  more deserving of
it in the right way.

"Go Brahmanesya Shubhamastu Nityam" - this is true whether or not the
brahmin has intellectual understanding or not whether the Go-mata is in a
shed, well taken care, or left to roam the streets. Today, the Brahmins have
been let loose to fend for themselves like a cow that is let loose on
streets, which deserves to be taken care and can only serve itself and the
world better when done so...

If we all can identify our swadharma according to our soul temperament and
follow it, there is no bigger help we can do to the world.

Sri Gurubhyo Namaha!
