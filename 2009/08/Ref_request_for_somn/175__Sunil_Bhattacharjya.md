Namaste,

Let us take the example of mercury that you have given. Mercury has been used in the Ayurvedic medicines after proper processing and thatwas the practice for the good cause of saving life and not for poisoning. Secondly the use of mercury for making Shivalinga requires some special care such that the mercury does not spill. Can you please elaborate as to why you highlighted only the negative and hypothetical side? 

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Namste:

Thank you for answering your own question.

Your are correct our jaTapaaTha, ghanapaaTha, rekhipaaThaa and other methodologies were used by various original texts to preserve and that credit must go to Brahmin's. That is where their utility ends as written text has become available. I have highest regards for them for their efforts.

adnyebhyo granthinaH shreShThaa granthibhyo dhaariNo varaaH |
dhaaribhyo dnyaaninaH shreShThaa dnyaanibhyo vyavasaayinaH || manusmR^iti 12.103 ||

Meaning - One who learns a little is better than the one who have not learned at all. One who memorizes are better than who have learned a little (at least they are faithful to the original works). One who knows the meanings are better than the ones who just memorize.The ones who use that knowledge are the superior ones.

Brahmins being the pillars supporting the roof is Saayanaacharya's statement and fully agree with.

Now we just want follow the mystiques rather than trying to understand the utility behind the that knowledge.

nagnataH kaiirtirastiiha na vittaM na punaH prajaaH |
indrovR^itravadhenaiva mahedraH samapadyataH || ma. bhaa. 15.15 ||

Meaing -A king who does not kill his enemy will never gain popularity, affluence (dhana) and this subjects will never enjoy safety. Indra became mahendrs only after destroying vR^itraasuraa ! 

Just imagine our history would be totally different if Pruthiraj had not spared the life of ghori !? Does this not mean that he had not understood the the core principle from mahaabhaarta as quoted above !

Further discussion will go beyond the scope of this list.

If you rather believe the H1N1 Virus is avakR^ipaa of devi but that is your choice. As a tantrik you can propagate eating Mercury and worshiping Mercury Shiva Lingbut to me that is a total "andha-shrddhaa" that because toxicity of mercury does not discriminate between a bhakta or an innocent by stander and remains true to its properties (guNadharma). 

If you wish to remain ignorant or find an excuse to academic Brahmins than that is your prerogative.

Best wishes

Dr,. Yadu

Against many odds the brAhmaNa-s did what they could and preserved what they can...one can be eitherthankful or just keep mum.

When resources are not available to understand..simply learning to recite is enough.. ofcourse understanding(which is equally imp)would be an added advantage.

Namaste:

Yes, Hinduism survived but that is purely academic as Brahmin's remained as lifeless pillars that supported the roof.

sthaaNur ayam bhaara-haaraH kilaabhuud, adhiitya veda.m navidnyaanaati yo.artham ||. saayaNaacaarya ||.

When Mohd.. Gajhani attacked Somanath temple Brahmins recited"Mahaarudra" and requested Shiva to open his "third" eye. The third for Shiva is supposed to be "j~naana chakhsu" to burn ignorance. When are we going to admit that it was the "Blind-Faith" on deities and Brahmin's that wanted to keep their importance in the society were primarily responsible for loss of our vedic knowledge as they remain the donkeys carryiong the weight of sandlewood.

tathaa hi vipraH shruti-shaastra-puuraaNaH, dnyaanena hiinaH pashubhiH samaanaH || Uttara giitaa ||

The number of Moron Sadhu's visiting US are hiding behind the the term "shaddhaa" and propagate Mysticism to line their own pockets for profit.

I have absolute no regard to the folks who promote recitation instead of understanding.

We rather remain slaves than become Gods and create heaven on this Earth. The concept for preferroing to remain "daasa" is clearly found in R^igveda as we want someone (deities)else to make us rich by remaining "daasa" (shuudra).

The latest fashion is that Sanskrit is great for Computers, but does anyone seriously think whether programmers are ever going to learn Sanskrit before programming ? This is just a feel good thing !? So much for Brahmin's. 

I know all of us though born in Brahman families and have undergone upanayana samskaraara, did sandhyaavadanama,doclean toilets in USneed to be classified as"shudra" !!

Regards,

Dr. Yadu

How about the scholars opinion that Hinduism survived the onslaught of the Muslim invasions and rule because of the Brahmins?

It means you ought to study the impact of Buddhism instead of being biased
in its favour!
If a condition in India gave rise to Buddhism, then there are two resulting
situations considering that Buddhism declined in India.

One is that the need gets fulfilled and Buddhism served its purpose. Did
it?

The other is like a condition that gives rise to the weed in a field which
condition gets rectified and the weeds are out. Here Buddhism is compared
to the weed.

You have to determine which one of this was the result.

Under Buddhism the role of Brahmins as an entity was unneeded as much as it
is under Hinduism. When something is not needed it will not exist.
