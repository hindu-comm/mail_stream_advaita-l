Dr. Yadu,

Just wanted to answer about paraSuraama.

paraSuraama was the only brahmin who did what you said. It is more symbolic
than factual. paraSuraama avataara was for "corrective" purpose. It is a one
time deed and He or anyone else advised any braahmaNa or others to "follow"
him in the kshatriya-obliteration.

More, later.
