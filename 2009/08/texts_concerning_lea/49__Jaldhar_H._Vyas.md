Probably the most relevant would be the Arthashastra of Chanakya called 
Kautilya.  He helped Chandragupta Maurya become ruler of Magadha and from 
thence emperor of most of India.  The Arthashastra was written to advise 
Chandragupta on running that empire.

Then there is the genre known as nitishastra.  Viduraniti in the 
Mahabharata is one of the most popular ones; there is also 
Kamandakyanitisara and Bhartrahari's Nitishataka.  These are not about 
management per se but interpersonal relationships and ethical conduct 
which are surely related topics.
