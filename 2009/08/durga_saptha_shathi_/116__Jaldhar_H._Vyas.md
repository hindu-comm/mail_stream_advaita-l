Why do you assume that he wants to learn the mantras for some material 
purpose?  Narayani (Durga) is not different from Narayana (Govinda) you 
know.

Suresh,

I would echo the advice others have given of finding a vidvan guru to 
learn about this (and your other questions.)  The Durga Saptashati being 
part of the puranas (Markandeya purana) is a "public" work and can be read 
or heard by anyone who is devoted to Mataji but for siddhi whether for 
dharma, artha, kama, or moksha, it requires special training.
