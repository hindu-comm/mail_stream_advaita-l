Dear Sri Suresh,

As I understand, may be incorrectly, reciting durga saptha shathi etc.
requires initiation.

You are requested to search the archives of Ambaa-l group or www.ambaa.org
as the members of the said group are exclusively into Shakthi and Siva
upasana marg. There, I am sure you will find the required information,
including PDF files of Devi Mahatmayam, which is nothing but Durga
Sapthashathi.

Regards,

narayan
