Dear Readers of Adwaita lists,
In the ICPR(Indian council for Philosophical Research) journal of April
2007 issue,there has been an article"Sadasadvilakshna-An Ontological gap
in Adwaita?"by prof.Srinivasa Rao.He has raised many interesting points on
the "sadasadvilakhana".I request the learned readers and subscribers to
the Adwaita lists to send their discussions and comments to enlighten on
this.
                                                             Regards,
                                                             N.Srikanta.
