Adi Sankaracharya wrote Padabhashya for all the major upanishads including Kena but for Kena he wrote an additional Vakyabhashya.

Ifthe Vakyabhashya of Adi Sankaracharyawas based on the onesuch written earlier by Brahmanadin, then the question arisesas to the possibility ofsome disagreement of Adi Sankaracharya's viewswith those of the views expressed in that lost work of Brahmanandinon Kena and also thathis own earlier Padabhashya on Kena could not alone stand in front of the Vakyabhashya of Brahmanandin..Whetherhewrotethe Vakyabhashyato challenge the views of Brahmanadin orwrote it withoutreferring tothe Vakyabhashyaof Brahmanandinthere must have beensome justifiable reason for Adi Sankarcharya, such asthe need to convey some additional messages throughanother Vakyabhashyaon top ofwhathe conveyedthrough his Pada bhashya on Kena.Secondly it can also be that much after penning the Padabhashya Adi Sankaracharyarealized some additional features of Kena, which made him feel the necessity of writng a Vakyabhashya on that.

Either way, ie.whatever the case might have been out of the above two possibilities, has anybody done any comaparative study of the two bhashyas on Kena?
