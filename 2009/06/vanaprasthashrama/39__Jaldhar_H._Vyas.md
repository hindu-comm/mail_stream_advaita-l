The vanaprastha ashrama has always been rather ill-defined.  We have 
volumes of dharmashastra about the duties and rituals of the brahmachari, 
grhastha, and sannyasi but next to nothing about the vanaprastha.  The 
Nirnayasindhu goes as far as to suggest that the vanaprastha ashrama 
doesn't exist in the Kaliyuga.  Certainly historical practice shows that 
people went directly from grhastha to sannyasa without any intermediate 
stage.
