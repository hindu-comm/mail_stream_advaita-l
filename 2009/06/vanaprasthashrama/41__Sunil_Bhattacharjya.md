Yes, Bharadwajji,

To my knowledge, in the GavardhanMath, established by Adi Sankaracharya in Puri, there have been cases of appointment of Grihasthi-turned-Sanyashis as Mathadhipatis. Even Sureshvaracharya, the first Mathadhipati in Sringeri was a Grihasthi-turned-Sanyashi.

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Very good observation Jaldharbhai.

Sant Thyagaraja was given a prior intimation by Lord Rama, in a dream
experience, that he was to shed his physical sheath in 10 days' time.

On waking and finishing his ablutions, Thyagaraja goes directly to his elder
brother's house, seeks and obtains his permission to take up sanyas. On the
very same day he takes up Sanyas Diksha.

There was no marked vaanaprastha phase in exemplary the life of this man of
Dharma too.

I know instances where the mahaswami of Kanchi had given permission for
sanyas diksha directly from the grihasthaashrama.

sarvE bhavanthu sukhinah
sarvE santhu niraamayaah
sarve bhadrANi pasyanthu
maa kaschit duhkhabhAg bhavEt.
