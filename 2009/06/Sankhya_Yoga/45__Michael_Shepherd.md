Geeta, namaskar --

Thanks for the compliment -- but not as unusual as might be thought; and
not, alas, as detailed..

In fact I know of many English people who have a working knowledge of
Sanskrit and who study Advaita Vedanta; from the angle of 'practical
philosophy'; which means that jnana, yoga and ayurveda may come into the
picture.

There is a tradition of non-dualism to be discovered in European culture if
looked for, especially in the 'mystics' of around the 14th century CE; and
also the Catholic Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa around 1400-1430, who said
"There is no 'other' ".. and "Wherever you look, you see the face of God"...

Yes, we're not all Bharata-destroying two-world Abrahmanic colonialists from
wicked anti-Vedic Oxford of 1852...       ;¬)

Michael

Dear Bhadraiah,

Not so. The Vedic inheritance is full of nirguna admonitions.  And in no way
connected with Abrahmanic cultures.

Dear Michael,



>Indeed it could be seen as the mark of a greater >devotion to God, never to
attempt to speak of Him.. >belief unquestioned and unbruised !


This is a needless extrapolation, probably caused by your own past
associations with Abrahamic culture.



Hara is not mentioned out of fear due to his being bhUtapati and rudra (one
who makes relatives weep due to loss of life), but becoming Hara is the last
necessary stage before realizing Brahman. Also, for the same reason rudra
owns whatever is left at place of yajna.



Conversely Vishnu is the first deva who comes into the yajna, so he is the
first deva who allowed the  existence of individual jiva. Without knowing
him there is no knowledge of Brahman either.



Will Abrahamic God permit someone becoming equal to him?



Devotion to a deva is fine, but one should also realize that thinking of
that deva as some one other than one self, and fearing that deva forever is
another form of ignorance. Fear is tamas caused by an unfit mind, and the
first casualty of fear is loss of expansion of chest, which leads to an
unfit body, and so goes down the spiral.



Regards

Bhadraiah
