PraNams to all

The saddarshanam talks during the Memorial Day camp are uploaded by Jay in the web site <www.advaitaforum.org>. One can listen to them. Note that if the video freezes, the Lord is indicating that it is time to do silence meditation of who that I am that is trying to listen to the talks and the silence that followed.

Any questions related to the topic can be raised on the list but with no guarantee that they will be answered in the way you want them to be answered. 


Hari Om!
Sadananda
