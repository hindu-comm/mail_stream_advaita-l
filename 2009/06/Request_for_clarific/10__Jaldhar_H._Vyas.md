The purpose of this illustration is to show how nothing is really ever 
created or destroyed only transformed from one state with a designated 
name and form to another.

What is called 'jar' is really just an arbitrary boundary around space. 
In the case of the human body it is the ahamkara which arbitrarily makes a

the ahamakara ceases but so too is jivanmukti.
