I would like to ask the spiritual authorities for the concept of attention
rested -- unconsciously or deliberately -- on those locations in the
physical body -- navel, heart, throat, tongue -- said to correspond to
spiritual states. These can often be recognised in the voice of speakers.

In particular, resting the attention on para is said to bring health to the
body. It is practised by singers, and has an immediate effect on breathing
which becomes slower and deeper.

The recommendation to rest attention deliberately on para suggests that,
unconsciously, the attention is resting in some less effective place, or
even an inappropriate place, most of the time !

This seems to be an important aspect of Advaita not often discussed, and I
would ask for the relevant teachings on this.
