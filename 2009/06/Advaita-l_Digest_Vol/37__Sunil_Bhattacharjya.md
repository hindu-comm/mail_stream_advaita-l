Dear Sankarji,

Interersting angle. It would be more useful if you can trace the sourcefrom which you wrote. To my knowledge if one had taken care of one's family wellduring the grihasthashrama and made provision in the form household wealth, for the old age,then one does not have to worry about sustenance for oneself and spouse according to the Hindu law of inheritance. The rule of law did prevail in ancient India and it was incumbent upon the younger generation to look after the older generation and it was also the duty of the ksatriyas to see that the rule of law prevailed. One could not get rid of the old people just like that. According rto the Dharmashastras it is the duty of the grihasthashramis to take care of all the four Ashramas.

Some of the people in the Vanaprastha stage could opt for teaching but to be an acharya one need not have to wait till the advanced age. The Aranyakas have been linked to the Vanaprasthis and the Upanishads have been linked to the Sanyashis but there was really not so hard and fast rule on this. Probably only those people who went to the forest were the brahmins so that they could do their meditations quietly and study and discuss the shastras together. Naimisharanya was one such place where such people came together.

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Sir,

I remember having read that the practice of "vaanaprasthham" might
have started as a means of marginalising, without much cruelty,
unproductive old people who were unable to work in the agricultural
field. It was said that the old people were taken to the forest and
left there with a certain stock of foodgrains, clothes etc., in a hut
there and they were thereafter not supposed to come back to their
family or the village seeking sustenance. Over centuries, the old
people, especially of the two higher castes - Brahmins and Kshathrias
- themselves retired to the forests, not to return,so that the younger
members of their families were saved of the embarrassment and the
moral guilt of having driven out their parents. This was all the more
so in the case of kings who had to settle the question of succession
among feuding family members as also rich brahmins whose assets were a
bone of contention for the younger members of the family.

Some of the more knowledgeable people who were in the vaanaprasthha
stage, naturally, introspected about life and its vagaries and it is
said that the "aaranyakas" reflect, to a certain extent, their
thinking and ways of life.

sankar
