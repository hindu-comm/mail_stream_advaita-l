Coud some one tell me whether the introductory verse of the chandala in the Manisha panchakam of Sankara is original, found in all the manuscripts or only in some manuscripts. Some publications do not include them. If found in any purana or vijayas which is its earliest date? Similarly the end verse? Thank you Nagaswamy
