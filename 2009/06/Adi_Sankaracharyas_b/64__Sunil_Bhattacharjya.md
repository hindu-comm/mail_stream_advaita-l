To my knowledge Chitsukhacharya had mentioned the number 16. If we can consider both the bhashyas of Kena as one then I thought we could include Sanatsujatiya bhashya in the list of 16.

> Dear friends,  To my understanding Adi Sankaracharya wrotesixteen bhashyas, the first being on the Vishnu Sahasranama and the last being on the Lalita Trishati. The second and the thrid were on the Bhagavad gita andthe Sarirakasutra rsepectively and the rest of the twelve included the eleven pada-bhashyas and one vakya-bhshya on the eleven Upanishads. Any comments from thelearned scholars?  Regards,  Sunil K. Bhattacharjya  

Please see http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/texts/shankara_works.html for a complete list.
