Sunilji,

This is not a response from a learned scholar --  but from one who has
wrestled with the opinions of a multitude of scholars...:

Two facts about Adi Shankara's writings are incontrovertible :

1) There is no conclusive proof that Adi Shankara wrote any of the bhashya
attributed to him;

2) There is no conclusive proof that Adi Shankara did not write any of the
bhashya attributed to him..

Michael :)

Dear friends,

To my understanding Adi Sankaracharya wrotesixteen bhashyas, the first
being on the Vishnu Sahasranama and the last being on the Lalita Trishati.
The second and the thrid were on the Bhagavad gita andthe Sarirakasutra
rsepectively and the rest of the twelve included the eleven pada-bhashyas
and one vakya-bhshya on the eleven Upanishads. Any comments from thelearned
scholars?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
