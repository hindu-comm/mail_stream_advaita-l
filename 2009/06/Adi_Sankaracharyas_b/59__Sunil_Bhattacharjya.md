Dear friends,

To my understanding Adi Sankaracharya wrotesixteen bhashyas, the first being on the Vishnu Sahasranama and the last being on the Lalita Trishati. The second and the thrid were on the Bhagavad gita andthe Sarirakasutra rsepectively and the rest of the twelve included the eleven pada-bhashyas and one vakya-bhshya on the eleven Upanishads. Any comments from thelearned scholars?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
