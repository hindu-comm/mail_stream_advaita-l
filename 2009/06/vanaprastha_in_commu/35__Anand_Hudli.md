Taking up Vanaprastha is forbidden in the Kali Yuga according to standard texts on Dharma 

such as the Dharma Sindhu. Other such "niShedhas" in the Kali Yuga include the ashvamedha 

yajna, the drinking of liquor by brAhmaNas, even as part of yajnas such as the 

sautrAmaNi, the usage of meat in shrAddha ceremonies, the killing of animals for the

madhuparka, etc. Please see the section titled 'kaliyuge niShiddhAni" in the third parichchheda

 (pUrva bhAga).
