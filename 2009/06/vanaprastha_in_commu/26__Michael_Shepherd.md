Sunilji,

Thank you for your prompt response. In practice, does the  vanaprasthi
remain in the family home, but 'retired' -- like a Western gentleman in his
'study' room ?

Michael

Dear Michaelji,

Vanaprastha is thestage ofretirement from the household responsibilities
andis the stage of trying to understand the spiritual aspects of whatever
Vaidic karmaone has been doingas a householder, studying the sacred
texts, having spiritual discussions with the Guru and the other
Vanaprasthis. Vanaprasthis do not have to give up the fire rituals etc.
Only in the next stage of Sanyasha that one gives upthe familyand the
samsara as well as the fire rituals andone cannot stay in one place for
long.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Months without questions, and now two at once !

Q: does the tradition speak of vanaprastha as entirely to do with personal
moksha; or is there a wider view of it ? i.e. does the prescribed
dissociation with institutions or organizations, still have a spiritual or
social connection with the community ?

The idea of vanaprastha as social isolation feels to me as lacking something
vital..

I hope this question makes some sense..

Michael
