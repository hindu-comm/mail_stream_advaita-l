Dear Members
The four systems of living -known as varnashrama dharma- were prescribed by 
our ancient Rishis to suit the needs of people of different inclinations but 
by no means these were compulsorily enforced.A brahmachari can be a 
brahmacharin till his last and so on. But the ashramite should strictly 
observe the codes of conduct prescribed as long as he/she is in that way of 
life.
At the same time one can also graduate to these 4 ashrams -way of living as 
and when he/she feels that he /she has acquired the necessary mental 
firmness not to slip away from that once that ashram -stage of life -is 
embraced.All these are purely voluntary.In our culture we attach more 
importance in the life here after than the present life time and all our 
scriptures prepare us for the same so that there is no fear of death.In our 
system there is no retirement as such as understood in the western culture 
and contributions from all the ashramites were always forthcoming towards 
the general weal.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Dear Michaelji,

AS I have understood ancient Varnashram System, there are four ashram 
vyavastha(syatem) establish and accepted by the society in ancient period 
i.e. Bhramcharyashram(age of studing vedas etc.),Grhusthashram(age when 
student get married and started marriage life),Vanaprasthashram(person 
satisfactorily completed family life and retired from household duty)and 
sanyashram(person who has left society for spiritual 
development-samyak+nyasa i.e.with understanding left family and social 
life).Now here the backbone of the social systam is Vanprasrtha as having 
experienced of family life and also earn livelihood for family and social 
life for so many years, used all that expert knowledge gain for teaching to 
the student of Gurukula staying with them and also donting to the Gurukula 
for his staying.So he is helping Gurukula by sharing his experienced and by 
way of donatoin with graefulness as he thinks that he has been gained from 
Gurukulas so as to return by
this way.Vanprastha as has been understood by westerner,a retire person is 
absolutely wrong understanding.I shall be thankful to the group allowing me 
to express my view and hoping comment from them.
Thanks,
Chandrakant Popat

Months without questions, and now two at once !

Q: does the tradition speak of vanaprastha as entirely to do with personal
moksha; or is there a wider view of it ? i.e. does the prescribed
dissociation with institutions or organizations, still have a spiritual or
social connection with the community ?

The idea of vanaprastha as social isolation feels to me as lacking something
vital..

I hope this question makes some sense..

Michael
