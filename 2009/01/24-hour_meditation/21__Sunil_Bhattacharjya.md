> Dear Vyasji,  This reminds me of what King Janaka told Rishi Ashtavakra
that while he was busy in all the mundane activities his mind was always in the
Brahman. That I understand is the 24-hour meditation. Are you referring to this
concept of 24-hour meditation? 

I am just forwarding the views of new member V. Ramani.  This question should
be addressed to him.
