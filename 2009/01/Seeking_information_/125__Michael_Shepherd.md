Michael

Rathna sanu sarasanam, rajathadri srunga nikethanam, Sinchini krutha pannageswarachyuthahana sayakam, Kshipra dhagdha pura thrayam thri divalayairabhi vanditham, Chandra shekaramasraye mama kim karishyathi vai yama. I seek refuge in Him, who has the moon, Who made the mountain of jewels in to his bow, Who resides on the mountain of silver, Who made the serpent Vasuki as rope, Who made Lord Vishnu as arrows, And quickly destroyed the three cities, And who is saluted by the three worlds, And so what can the God of death do to me? Pancha paada pa pushpa gandhambhuja dwaya shobitham, Phala lochana jatha pavaka dagdha manmatha vigraham, Basma digdha kalebharam, bhava nasanam, bhava mavyayam, Chandra shekaramasraye mama kim karishyathi vai yama. I seek refuge in Him, who has the moon, Who shines with the pair of his lotus like feet, Which are worshipped by the scented flowers of five kalpaka trees, Who burnt the body of God of love, Using the fire from the eyes on his forehead, Who applies ash all over his body, Who destroys the sorrow of life, And who does not have destruction, And so what can the God of death do to me? Matha varana mukhya charma kruthothareeya mahoharam, Pankajasana padma lochana poojithangri saroruham, Deva sindhu tharanga seekara siktha jatadharam, Chandra shekaramasraye mama kim karishyathi vai yama. I seek refuge in Him, who has the moon, Who is the stealer of minds because of his upper cloth, Made of the skin of the ferocious elephant, Who has lotus like feet which are worshipped, By Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu, And who has matted hair drenched by drops, Of the waves of the holy river Ganga, And so what can God of death do to me? Yaksha raja sakham bhagaksha haram bhujanga bhooshanam, Shila raje suthaa parish krutha charu vama kalebharam, Kshweda neela galam praswadha dharinam mruga dharinam, Chandra shekaramasraye mama kim karishyathi vai yama. I seek refuge in Him, who has the moon, Who is friend of Lord Khubhera, Who destroyed the eyes of Bhaga, Who wears serpent as ornament, Whose left part of the body is decorated, By the daughter of the king of mountain, Whose neck is blue because of the poison, Who is armed with an axe, And who carries a deer with Him, Lyrics & translation credit: VEDANTA SPIRITUAL LIBRARY.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I have been looking for English translations of certain Shiva prayers, such
as Chandrashekhara Ashtakam. And have been unable. Could you direct me to
some site if you are aware of one?

Sincerely, rohni.
