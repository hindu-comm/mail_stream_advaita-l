Pranam.

Mentors may kindly advise me as to whether an event Bhagavatham to be held in New Delhi (Feb 16-23, 2009), can be notified for the listed members and invite those who are interested and living nearby to attend the same.

If more details are required, I will provide the same please.

Looking forward to being elucidated.

With highest regards,

Sincerely,



R. Venkateswaran
