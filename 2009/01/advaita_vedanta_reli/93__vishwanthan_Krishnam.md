>>According to me religious practices help one to be disciplined and
allow one to contemplate on the why of everything leading to
enlightenment
Thats a very broad sweeping statement is it not? there should be a qualifier, religious practices or any other activity within the realms of dharma 

any adharmic actions even if sanctioned by a religion will not lead to enlightenment

Vishwam

Dear members 
Religious practice without dogmatism certainly helps in getting clear understanding of the Advaitic philosophy which is based on Vedas.In my view religion is not at all an impediment but an enabling one to realise the Truth.SriRamana Maharishi`s advice to all westerners was to practice their respective religion.According to me religious practices help one to be disciplined and allow one to contemplate on the why of everything leading to enlightenment.R.Krishnamoorthy.
