Shri Ramaniji,

Let us not misunderstand each other !

Your answer is self-sufficient.. : if we contemplate the Absolute grace by
which teachers of mankind manifest in human form, it does appear that they
tend to manifest 'when misery overflows in Creation, and bad influences
enter mankind'...rather than when all is going well under divine law..

So they address simultaneously, both the situation of the times, and the
universal situation, with their wonderful and astonishing 'help' ?

Regards,
Michael
