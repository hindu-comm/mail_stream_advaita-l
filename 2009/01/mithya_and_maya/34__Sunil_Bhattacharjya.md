Dear Michael,

There are two ways of looking at Maya. One is Maya as the Lord has used to create the world and He understands it fully andthe Sattva gunis can have glimpse of that. The other is Avidya or ignorance of the people who, have predominance of Rajas and Tamas. They are very involved in themselves as individual with identity separate from the rest of the world and God. Probably this concept needs more elaboration and even then the words are inadequate to explain it fully. There is in reality no substitute for learningthese higher conceptsfrom a guru by sitting next to him.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

I'm curious to understand how maayaa, as the magic of Creation, should have
come, in time,  to be regarded as a veil, an obstacle, in 'seeing through
mithya'.. why did the 'wonder' disappear from maayaa ?!

Some commentators on Shankara seem to blame him for making maayaa seem like
this, an obstacle to be overcome by jnana rather than by bhakta..

Could you explain how this misunderstanding was inevitable in some minds ?
