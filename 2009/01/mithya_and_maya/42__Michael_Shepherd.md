Sadanandaji --

Your answer makes it all beautifully simple for me : the bhakti looks
'outward' and sees the whole Creation as the Self; the jnani looks 'within'
and finds the Self there too. Someone could change from one to the other in
a moment ! Or even be both at the same time ?

We do get caught up in words. Obviously, there are pitfalls for either path.
And each path needs the other -- is that right ?

Michael
