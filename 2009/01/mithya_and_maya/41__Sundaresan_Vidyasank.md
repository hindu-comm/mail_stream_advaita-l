Well, to extend the magician-audience analogy for mAyA, the magician
does not have the same sense of wonder that his audience does. More
likely, he is merely amused.

>From the perspective of realization, when I see through the nature of
things and the jnAna dawns that I am indeed the magician, the sense of
wonder also vanishes. It is not as if the wonder is an obstacle to be
consciously overcome, but it is that it just ceases to operate.
