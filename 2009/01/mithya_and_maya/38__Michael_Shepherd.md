Sadanandaji --

Thank for another graceful answer.

But may I press this question ? Maybe it is just a weakness of the Western
mind..

The jnani in me accepts maayaa as anirvacaniyam.

But the rather starved Western bhakti in me would like to see it also as the
sparkling rainbow of the magic of Creation !

Am I missing some connection ? I think I may be !
