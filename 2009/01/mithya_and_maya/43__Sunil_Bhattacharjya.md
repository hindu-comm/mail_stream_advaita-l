Dear Michaelji,

"Seeing the whole creation as the Self" itself is Jnana. Bhakti is desire to know this reality. Bhakti belongs to mind and hence to Prakriti. Bhakti is desire to escape from the bonds of Prakriti and realise the Purusha, the self , who is not different from the Supreme self.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Sadanandaji --

Your answer makes it all beautifully simple for me : the bhakti looks
'outward' and sees the whole Creation as the Self; the jnani looks
'within'
and finds the Self there too. Someone could change from one to the other in
a moment ! Or even be both at the same time ?

We do get caught up in words. Obviously, there are pitfalls for either path.
And each path needs the other -- is that right ?

Michael
