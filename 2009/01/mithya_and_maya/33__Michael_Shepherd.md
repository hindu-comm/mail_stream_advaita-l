I'm curious to understand how maayaa, as the magic of Creation, should have
come, in time,  to be regarded as a veil, an obstacle, in 'seeing through
mithya'.. why did the 'wonder' disappear from maayaa ?!

Some commentators on Shankara seem to blame him for making maayaa seem like
this, an obstacle to be overcome by jnana rather than by bhakta..

Could you explain how this misunderstanding was inevitable in some minds ?
