Dear Sadanandaji,

One can see through Mithya only when one has the right knowledge. When one has the knowledge then and then onlyone can really take Mithya as mithya otherwise it will like learningby a parrot.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

>From my understanding:

maayaa is the power by which one appears to be many. The locus of the power is
Iswara. Krishna says - diivam .. mama maayaa - this maaya of mine is divine
origin. 
maaya makes impossible possible - aghaTita ghaTanaa paTiiyasii maayaa - just as
one mind projects multitude of plurality - movable and immovable in the dream
state. That power because of which one appears to be many is maaya. Scripture
equates it to prakRiti - maayantu prakRitin vidyaat - says swetaasvatara
upanishad.

mithyaa is the product of maaya. what I see or perceive is mithyaa - it is
neither sat nor asat - Sat is that which never changes and asat is that which
has no locus for existence.  Whatever I see is changing therefore not sat but
since it is experienced it is not asat. It is called mithyaa - like ring in
comparison to gold, as a worldly example. The whole world is mithyaa since it is
experienced and continuously changing. The power because of which it is seen and
seen as changing is maaya. Taking mityaa as real is delusion. Taking mithyaa as
mithyaa or apparent but not really real is knowledge. 

Hope this helps.

Hari Om!
Sadananda

A respectful request to relate the terms 'mithya' and 'maya' in
relation to
'illusion'..

Which term has the more ancient history in Advaita-Vedanta ?

Do they both have an universal and an individual aspect ?

Personally, I try to 'look through' illusion, and learn from
iignorance...
but it would be good to hear from the wiser !
