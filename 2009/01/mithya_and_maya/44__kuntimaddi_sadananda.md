Michael - Yes indeed - jnaanam is to recognize both inside and outside - is nothing notions in the mind - In deep sleep where is inside and what is outside - Sat - Chit - Ananda is all pervading reality that you are - jiiva-jagat-Iswara - all rise in one, sustained by the one and goes back into one - that you are - tat tvam asi - says upanishad. NaarayaNa is inside as well as out side - antarbahischa tat sarvam vyaapya naaraayana sthitaH| 

Hence Krishna says -
yo maam pasyati sarvatra sarvanca mayi pasyati - who sees Me everywhere and everything in Me, he is never away from me and I am never away from him.  That is from Bhakti point.

>From jnaana point he also says - just one previous sloka 

sarvabhutastam aatmaanam sarva bhuutanica aatmani} who sees all beings in him and he in all beings - he is jnaani.

Hence jnaana leads to true bhakti and true bhakti leads to jnaana. They are two sides of the same coin.

The self realization is actually very simple and direct - The preconceived notions about oneself, about the world and about the Lord - they forms the barriers for direct knowledge. Hence purification of the mind to get rid of the wrong notions is what is required. All yogas are meant for that. 
Otherwise there is nothing to realize other than dropping all the wrong notions about yourself where you take yourself as not the self that you are. Even the notion that I have to realize itself forms the last  block for realization since the very notion that I have to realize establishes the goal away from yourself that you are. But that longing will not go until one drops all the notions about oneself.

Sadanandaji --

Your answer makes it all beautifully simple for me : the bhakti looks
'outward' and sees the whole Creation as the Self; the jnani looks 'within'
and finds the Self there too. Someone could change from one to the other in
a moment ! Or even be both at the same time ?

We do get caught up in words. Obviously, there are pitfalls for either path.
And each path needs the other -- is that right ?

Michael
