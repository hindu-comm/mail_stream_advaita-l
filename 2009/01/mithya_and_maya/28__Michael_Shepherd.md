A respectful request to relate the terms 'mithya' and 'maya' in relation to
'illusion'..

Which term has the more ancient history in Advaita-Vedanta ?

Do they both have an universal and an individual aspect ?

Personally, I try to 'look through' illusion, and learn from iignorance...
but it would be good to hear from the wiser !
