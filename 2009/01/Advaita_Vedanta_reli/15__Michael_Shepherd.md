Oh by the way, I've heard the 'scientific method' expanded to four supports
: shruti, paramatman (in the sense of living sage or guru or teacher),
reason, and experience..

I too would be glad to know more of the references for the validity of
certain smritis to certain yugaa..

I would like to clarify my personal stance : Michael Shepherd, thanks to the
grace of Advaita, does not entertain 'doubts', knowing that there is only
one true answer to be found in atmabrahma..

My comments related to a previous posting on this thread, in respect of Adi
Shankara's sever remarks about Jainism, Buddhism, Sankya, etc.

I recalled comments said to have been made by the late Shri Shankaracharya
Shantananda Saraswati, about the timely arrival in a divided world of such
as Adi Shankara..

As to interpretation -- this is a personal matter. And I fully support the
'scientific' method of shruti, reason, and experience in accordance. I've
looked at the Wikipedia entry on 'scientific method' -- the problem is that
'scientists' still believe the physical world to be the only one, thus
revealed by scientists... I think you would have to rewrite the whole entry
to get the idea of 'three worlds' across.. and that might cause a spiritual
flutter among the scientific pigeons, so to speak...

Pranam to all.

I read with much interest Shri Sunil Bhattacharya's clarifications to Shri
Michael Shepherd's doubts.  I wish to seek further clarification.

Shri Bhattacharya ji has mentioned that some of the smritis are meant for
certain yugas.  Will it possible to give references of the texts from where
these references have been found?

I thank all in advance for their consideration and help in elucidating me.

With highest regards,

Sincerely,


R. Venkateswaran
