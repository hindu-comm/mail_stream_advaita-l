Sorry, I have mis-stated Sankara's position about rejection of the n-world
theories (Ch.U.VI.2.1-4).  

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe01/sbe01120.htm

Sankara's rejection was only with regard to getting fixated on a particular
n-world theory or a particular sequence of the creation of the components
of this world. Sankara knows that Shruti can not be rejected outright,
because the particular story (such as above) is true for that situation. 
A different number of elements or sequence may be present elsewhere
which needs a different interpretation. These stories have to be
understood in the respective contexts and the path for liberation is decided
by exact method of unwinding the model. 

Regards
Bhadraiah
