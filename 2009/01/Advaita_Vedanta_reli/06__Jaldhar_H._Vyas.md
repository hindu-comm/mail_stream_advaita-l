We must take exception to the notion that being a pure advaiti is in 
anyway the same as "not believ[ing] in any religion."  Advaita Vedanta is 
grounded in one particular religion -- that of the Vedas and the shastras 
dependent on them.  All teachers of Advaita Vedanta from Gaudapadacharya 
and Shankaracharya to the paramacharya who advised you have believed this.

Brahman can be realized by everyone in this world _right_now_.  The very 
reason it is is possible is that it is _not_ dependent on the body or 
other externalities.  I look forward to scientific progress too but not 
because it will help the pursuit of jnana at all.
