Namaste Shrinivas,

I searched the archives but could not find anything as relevant as your
starting-point. So may I try your patience a little further with what is
my crude understanding of your five points ?

A pair of laboratories devoted to first-year science students :

In the chemistry lab., two students are watching the teacher make water out
of hydrogen and oxygen.. one student (who wonders why the teacher bothers
with a well-known fact) makes notes and closes his notebook. The other
student is filled with wonder that two gases combine to make a liquid
 what
other wonders are to be revealed ?.. Their notebooks contain much the same
notes however.

In the biology lab., two students are dissecting frogs. One checks the
details with the textbook. The other is filled with wonder 
 feels no
different from the frog
 what other wonders are to be discovered, he
wonders
goes away with his advaitika sense strengthened that Brahman is to
be seen in all the worlds wonders


In the objective, physical world  no difference. But the subjective mental
world is more likely to turn up two future researchers out of the four !

And then, if they pursue their studies, they will eventually come to that
connection between science and the mental world.. which you say may be seen
in quantum physics.

If its not too much to ask, would you suggest how your point 4 may begin to
be revealed ?

Best wishes,

Michael
