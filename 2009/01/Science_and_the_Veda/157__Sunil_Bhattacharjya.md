Dear Michaelji,

While Sriniwasji will reply to you I will draw your attention to the fact that all the creation is of Adi Shakti or Prakriti. The ancient seers visualised Adi Shakti (Durga) with the ten hands representing the ten dimensions. Compare this with the proposed string thory with the ten dimensions.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Namaste Shrinivas,

In the light of your replies, am I too bold or too precipitous or too
superficial, in suggesting that Stephen Hawking's Grand Unification Theory
of the 'four forces of the universe' (strong force, weak force,
electro-magneticism, gravity) may indeed be prefigured in the language of
the Veda as read through Advaita ?

Namaste Shri Bhattacharjya,

(Please address me simply as Gadkari or Shrinivas)
Yes Modern Science does show that all matter is connected intricately -
perhaps the EPR Paradox
and recent experiments that test Bell's Inequalities highlight this.
See eg. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test_experiments

Next step is to realize that in all such experiments, the key factor is
interaction of the observer.
Then ask if the observer is made of "matter" or something different
from
matter. If the observer is
made of matter there should be no reason for matter to behave fundamentally
differently in presence
or absence of an observer.

Regards,
Shrinivas

Namaste gadkariji,

If it is not out of place I may add the following to your first point.
Modern science exclusively deals with the Physical world or can we say the
material world. While the gross physical world obeys a set of mathematical
/ physical laws and that at the atomic / subatomic level has somewhat
different sets of laws finally coming to the equivalence of mass and energy
and the wave nature of matter. Finally this shows uniformity in the ultimate
constitution of the physical world or can we say that no mater is really
essentially separate in the ultimate sense.

Regards,

Sunil Kumar Bhattacharjya
