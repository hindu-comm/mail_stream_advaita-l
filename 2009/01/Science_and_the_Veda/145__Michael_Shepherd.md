With respect :

Here is a simple proposition which those more knowledgeable in Advaita
Vedanta might like to discuss and correct :

Brahman is Advaita by nature. Therefore there can be no disparity between
the Veda and science, except through misunderstanding.

Science, which in the West was originally connected with all worlds in the
advaitic viewpoint by being called natural science, has become concerned
only with the material world.

Such scientists cannot cope therefore with the concept eternal by dint of
their closed minds.

Thus the main stumbling block  and also the spur to research in maya  of
evolution should be seen in relation to the eternal Days and nights of
Brahma  the universe which shrinks to a material nothing; sleeps; and
awakens again to expand.

Chance  the essence of natural selection and survival of the fittest
  is the genius, the grace, of Brahman; as is entropy  the godly
creation, sustenance, and withdrawal of all created things (but not, of
course, of things eternal..)

The world of the 'sub-atomic' will be found to be infinitely intricate in
the material world until its laws are seen to be those of the divine mind in
Creation.

I think thats enough for the esteemed and distinguished members of this
invaluable website to deal with, from this humble seeker after truth..
