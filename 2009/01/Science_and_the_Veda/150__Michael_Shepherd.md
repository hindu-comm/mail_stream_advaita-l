Namaste Shrinivasji,

Apologies -- I looked for an earlier discussion but did not find it. Nor did I know the term 'M-science'.. are there other such terms ?

I appreciate your answer, for which thanks; questions can refine questions !

I have always understood that the 'three worlds' have their own laws. I shall search for the previous discussion and hope to pass on the answers there to others with the same questions.

Thank you again.

Michael

Subject: [Advaita-l] Science and the Veda


Namaste Michael,

This topic has been discussed in quite some details in the past on
this list please go through the archives.

Without repeating what has been written before, here is a starting
point into this inquiry:
1. By Science let us mean "Modern Science", which exclusively deals
   with the physical world.
2. Let us not attempt the astronomic feat of trying to connect Science
   with Advaita in a single step.
3. Since Science deals with the physical world, consider "M-Science" 
   which we define to be the knowledge that deals with the Mental world 
   - the world of ideas, thoughts, emotions ... everything that we loosely
   associate with the Mind. 
4. Now try to find connections between Science and M-Science (Quantum 
   physics is the connection point)
5. From M-Science connect Veda and ultimately Advaita.
Best wishes.

Regards,
Shrinivas

[Advaita-l] Science and the Veda

With respect :
Here is a simple proposition which those more knowledgeable in Advaita
Vedanta might like to discuss and correct :
Brahman is Advaita by nature. Therefore there can be no disparity between
the Veda and science, except through misunderstanding.
‘Science’, which in the West was originally connected with all worlds in the
advaitic viewpoint by being called ‘natural science’, has become concerned
only with the material world.
Such scientists cannot cope therefore with the concept ‘eternal’ by dint of
their closed minds.
Thus the main stumbling block – and also the spur to research in maya – of
‘evolution’ should be seen in relation to the eternal ‘Days and nights of
Brahma’ – the universe which shrinks to a material ‘nothing’; sleeps; and
awakens again to expand.
‘Chance’ – the essence of ‘natural selection’ and ‘survival of the fittest
 – is the genius, the grace, of Brahman; as is ‘entropy’ – the godly
creation, sustenance, and withdrawal of all created things (but not, of
course, of things eternal..)
The world of the 'sub-atomic' will be found to be infinitely intricate in
the material world until its laws are seen to be those of the divine mind in
Creation.
*
I think that’s enough for the esteemed and distinguished members of this
invaluable website to deal with, from this humble seeker after truth..
