Ok good point.  However I should point out that "transitoriness" or 
"ephemerality" are just particular instances of the idea of mithyatva 
in the dimensions of time and space.  The scope of mithyatva is not 
exhausted by them.

perhaps we can say it like this.  Satya is the unshakable objective notion 
of truth.  Its manifestation is jnana.  Mithya is the unstable, subjective 
notions which is always liable to revision.  The outward manifestation of 
mithyatva is in various types of illusion or delusion

What do you think?
