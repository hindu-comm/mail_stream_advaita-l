Dear Sri Vyas
I think the definition conceptual error will be more appropriate for maya 
than mithyathva.Maya is of varying degrees and its veiling power varies from 
individual to individual.But mithya is same for all -it is just mistaking 
one thing for the other and it is in a lower level and stops with sensory 
perception.Life is mithya is same for all.But living is maya.The same life 
experience may be painful or enjoyable according to one`s concept of what is 
happiness or sadness.Mithya can be held equivalent to transitory or 
ephimeral.R.Krishnamoorthy.
