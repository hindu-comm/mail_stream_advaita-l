Recently I am reading a book 'Sthita Prajna Vaibhavamu' in Telugu. The book is very good.
The book is written by Sri Sri Sri Ramakrishnaananda Swamy, 
published by Sri Bhoomaanandaashram, Gandi Kshetram, Veeranna Gattu Palle Post 516329, Cuddappah District, Andhra Pradesh.

Appreciate if any one can give more information about  Swamiji and Ashram

Thanks and regards
-- Durga
