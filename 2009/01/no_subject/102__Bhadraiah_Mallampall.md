Dear Shri Bhattacharya,   I was just exploring how to evaluate Shakya culture from karma point of view.
Events in all our puranas have their own cause-effect chains.  

It is possible Shakyas may have a different culture and traditions and 
they may see Vedic people from their own view point. As you hear these days 
the Himalayan kingdoms of Nepal have other tribes who may not agree with 
Bhagawatgita, and communists are meddling to create divisions. 
Traditions are a matter of negotiation between tribes. 

If Buddha indeed had vedic learning I would inquire into the background of the Rajguru.  
The more you discuss the better. 

Lord Buddha's contributions are indispensable for his time, but we move on with times.  

Regards
Bhadraiah
