Yes I was aware of that fact. I was just explaining further about my own
post.

Yes I already confirmed what you said, unless there was a typo or a
missing comma. There was no dispute with you. 

My argument was something else, about the devayana marga being
qualified as brahmajnana. 

I now want to tag on pitryana marga also as qualified as brahmanjana,
provided shrti gives extremely detailed instructions for meditation as well! If
such a rare Shruti is to be every found which has instructions for doing the
yajna as well as for meditation (re; knowledge of devas), simply following
the prescribed the rites prescribed by such a shurti would qualify as
brahmajnana.  

Taking this further (to ridiculous levels?) even non-performance is
brahmajnana when a guru standing before this person explains how deep
this person fell due to such non-performance and then provides a detailed
instructions for rites which include meditation methods. Logically this is
same as your akarma or nishkama karma.

Bhadraiah
