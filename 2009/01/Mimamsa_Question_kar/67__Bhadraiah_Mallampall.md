I do not see any reason why an individual variation of any sort in the vidhis by time, place, causation
or guru/rishi ceases to be apaurusheya as long as the individual variation of the yajna mirrors the yajna 
that is going on within the individual. 

It is always a good idea to find common approaches to the vidhis by consensus. But if some of them are 
conditionally wrong so be it. It all depends on the knowledgeable persons being present at that time.
The process by which one person learns is similar to how another person learns, but there are also 
differences, so there would always be different archetypes. 

When there is a disconnect between the vidhis and the real yajna within, the vidhis cease to be
apaurusheya... unless expiation is done which puts yajna back on track. The vidhis demand that 
the performers' minds be also synchronized, don't they? The catch is only people with brahmajnanam
can recognize this. If at least the person doing expiation doesn't have brahmajnanam that may trigger
another expiation and so on going into a loop and we are thrown out of the yajna. A person with the
brahmajnanam will anyway occupy the right place before the yajna starts. So we may be fine. 
Any comments? 

Regards
Bhadraiah
