Sir, 

>>here to say only text is apaurusheya but practicals of these contents are> not apaurusheya...Does it not mean
to >>say texts/sentences that denote the> brahma jnAna is apaurusheya but brahma jnAna itself NOT
apaurusheya??
>This does not follow, because of the same reason as above. Moreover, brahma
>jnAna is not action.

What is seen as brahma jnAna at "gross" level is actually translatable into interactions between
the devas and Rtviks at "finer" level. The ritual & actions done on the vedi are only symbolic of the interactions
between the devas and Rtviks (within the body/mind/cosmos). From this view point the ritual portions and the corresponding actions are very much apaurusheya as per purva mimamsa. 

Regards
Bhadraiah
