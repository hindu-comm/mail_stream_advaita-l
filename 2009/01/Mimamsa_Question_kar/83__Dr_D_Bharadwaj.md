Thank you Sri Rama,

There was a similar sensible appeal from Sri Vidyasankar . I am pasting a
copy of it here so that a copy will be there on this thread too...:

May I request members to not engage in prolonged discussions of issues that
are at best peripheral to advaita vedAnta?
Also, please note that the authority of Wikipedia is only as good as the
authors
who contribute to articles in it. If you do not like or do not agree with
some article,
you are free to become an author on Wikipedia and get involved. There is no
purpose served by discussing Wikipedia articles on the scientific method or
Gautama
the Buddha on this list.
Thanks,
Vidyasankar


I as a new member to the Group am interested in the enlightening
quality discussions on the fundamental/ core issues.

Regards,
Dr. D. Bharadwaj
