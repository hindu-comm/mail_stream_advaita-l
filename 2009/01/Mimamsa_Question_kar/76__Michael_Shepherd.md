Surely mass = energy is no problem to any deva worth the name ?

>Science has established the equivalence of mass and energy.

Equivalence of mass and energy is at very high level, like saying Devadatta
has attained brahmajnanam. When sub atomic particles are mentioned by
name they have to explained how and why thery are relevant or
convertible to energy. We haven't so far seen the electron itself being
converted into energy. The nuclear energy that we know is merely release
of the binding forces when big atoms are split into small ones; and
accounts for some minor variations in masses of electrons and protons
themselves when they are within or outside of an atom. When individual
devas and their actions are mentioned these statements must be resolved
before brahmajnanam can be confirmed. That is the challenge before purva
mimamsakas.
