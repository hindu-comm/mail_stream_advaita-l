What exactly do you mean by apaurusheya here? And what is the yajna that
goes on within the individual?

So, everything is left to chance or to some mysterious providence? The authority
of the veda does not work that way.

This makes absolutely no sense. A fault in the performance of a yajna calls
for expiation. It has no bearing whatsoever on the apaurusheyatva of the
vedic injunction that underpins that yajna.

A person with brahmajnAna does not initiate or participate ritually in any yajna.
The only right place for a brahmajnAnI in a yajna is to be a witness to it. In fact,
only one who is not a brahmajnAnI is a performer of any act, including yajna-s.
