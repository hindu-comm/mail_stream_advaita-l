Firstly you did not mention that science proved the equivalence of mass and energy and when that was pointed out, now you say that it is at a high level. Do you want us to point the inaccuracies time and again to you so that you can just brushthem aside as unimportant. I think you have to brush up your knowledge of nuclear science if you have read that subject at all in depth. Also have you read the book on occult Chemistry, wherepeople used yogic power tofind the quarks much before the modern science discovered the sub-atomic particles? You read the books by Prof. Arnikar and others.

Equivalence of mass and energy is at very high level, like saying Devadatta
has attained brahmajnanam. When sub atomic particles are mentioned by
name they have to explained how and why thery are relevant or
convertible to energy. We haven't so far seen the electron itself being
converted into energy. The nuclear energy that we know is merely release
of the binding forces when big atoms are split into small ones; and
accounts for some minor variations in masses of electrons and protons
themselves when they are within or outside of an atom. When individual
devas and their actions are mentioned these statements must be resolved
before brahmajnanam can be confirmed. That is the challenge before purva
mimamsakas.
