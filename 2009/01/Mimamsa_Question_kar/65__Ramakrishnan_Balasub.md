Late-reply - sorry I have been incredibly busy of late.

Sorry, I misunderstood your question  "Is
it the case that there exists an a-priori set of polymorphic forms of agnihotra
(for example), and the specific recension just captures what is sufficient to
it? or".

Let me first admit that my understanding comes from reading texts like
mImA.msA paribhASha, mImA.msA nyAya prakAsa and explanations of
concepts by Shankara and Sureshvara in their pUrvapakSha arguments.
One particular example is the case of sandhyAvandanam. The karmotpatti
vidhi can be found in the 2nd prashna of the taittirIya AraNyaka among
other places, but the actual procedure can vary quite a bit. The
regional variances are significant. Even a simple karma like the
puNyAhavAcanam have some regional differences in the mantras employed.

It's possible that the text is talking about agnihotra in particular -
perhaps there is no variation between these various texts? I am aware
of the texts in the taittirIya shakha and the general procedure for
the agnihotra (though I don't do it), but have no knowledge of the
texts from the other shAkhas. I may also have some quotes from
Shankara on this topic of karma - but I need to verify and hunt them
down.

I am more than a little puzzled here - how does the kArIrI iShTi
figure in the agnihotra discussion?

The argument is understood easily by noting the acceptance of the
apauruSheyatva of all the shAkhas. If a text by a human author
repeated the same thing in two or more places, that is repetitious.
When there is a set of texts, all of them aparuSheya, the only
repetition can be if two aparuSheya texts talking about the same
subject are used by the same person - which is not the case - since
different shAkhas use different texts. A set of aparuSheya texts
cannot be restricted in subject matter or scope, beyond the fact that
they need to inform us what is not known by the other means of
knowing. Other than that, they are what they are.
