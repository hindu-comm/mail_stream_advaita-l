>Surely mass = energy is no problem to any deva worth the name ?

This is old hat. The five elements space, fire/light, air, water earth form a
complete model; and it is well known there would interactions and
convertibility between them like it happens to any n-element model in
Shruti. Science only cares about mass, enegrgy and space or mass and
space or space only depending on what subject in science you are talking
about. Convertibility aspect is not very different between science and
veda, though specifics of how the elements are actually treated is on
different lines.

As for devas go, they are very much mapped on to nature, if you pick up
any upanishat. Yes a lot of research is pending on cosmological
representation of devas.

Bhadraiah
