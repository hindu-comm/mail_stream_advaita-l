Science works at the level of matter and energy alone .Our ancient rishis went to other different subtle levels also.When a person dies he leaves the material body and is left with the astral body or preta-deha. Daily rituals are performed after the person's death so that the preta-deha is gradually replaced by a pitri-deha. Similar is the creation of Divyadeha. Bhishma got his Divyadeha on the Bhashmashtami and he returned to the Vasu-Loka. All these are beyond the realm of science.

As regards Space, the rishis found that it is the sublest of the five elements of nature. Modern science is yet to achieve this level. The ancient rishisnever said that the universe is expanding. Today the modern cosmologists are realising that the Big bang theory, with its expanding-universe model, ison its way out and the day is not far when they will realise that the world was created from space and it can return to space as spaceis the storehouse of the creation or the Avyakta prakriti.

>Surely mass = energy is no problem to any deva worth the name ?

This is old hat. The five elements space, fire/light, air, water earth form a
complete model; and it is well known there would interactions and
convertibility between them like it happens to any n-element model in
Shruti. Science only cares about mass, enegrgy and space or mass and
space or space only depending on what subject in science you are talking
about. Convertibility aspect is not very different between science and
veda, though specifics of how the elements are actually treated is on
different lines.

As for devas go, they are very much mapped on to nature, if you pick up
any upanishat. Yes a lot of research is pending on cosmological
representation of devas.

Bhadraiah
