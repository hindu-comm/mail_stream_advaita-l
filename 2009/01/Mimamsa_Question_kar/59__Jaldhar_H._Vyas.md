No I think that is too much of a stretch.  It is true that Jaimini is 
mentioned by name more often than Badarayana but as the "default" position 
of the Brahmasutras is that of Badarayana that hardly means anything.  The 
sutra genre prizes brevity above all so it would be pointless to mention 
the authors name unless absolutely needed to prevent ambiguity.  Also 
while Jaiminis views are mentioned as siddhanta in some cases, they are 
refuted in others.  See 1.3.26-33 for an example.

So there is reason enough to consider Vedanta and Purva Mimamsa as two 
seperate darshans but one cannot take it too far in the other direction. 
They are two very closely related darshans.
