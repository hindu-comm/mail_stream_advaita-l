I have a small doubt here about apaurusheyatva of 'text' of
shruti-s...whether text ( here if it means manuscript of the shruti) itself
has the *apaurusheya* status or the jnAna that is embedded in these texts
has the apaurusheya status??  If the wordings (text) of the scriptures
itself has the apaurusheya status then we have to say these wordings which
denote certain acts should also have to have the status of apaurusheya.
Otherwise we have to say these prayOga-s/karma-s have been *first*
theoritically explained in apaurusheya shruti-s, later on some karmi-s (say
pUrva mImAmsaka-s)  have implemented and followed the rituals/prayoga-s
*practically*...I am unable to understand which would be the ideal scenario
here to say only text is apaurusheya but practicals of these contents are
not apaurusheya...Does it not mean to say texts/sentences  that denote the
brahma jnAna is apaurusheya but brahma jnAna itself NOT apaurusheya??
Kindly clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
