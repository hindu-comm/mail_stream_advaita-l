Kamau Moyenda

For the first time there is difficulty in describing anything about 
"myself"
since There was introduction to none-duality teaching. A few years ago,
there was understanding that 'I' was not who 'I' thought i was. There have
been many experiences to confirm this! So Geting established in all that I
am require constant awareness, constant attention. Dhyana meditation,
contemplation and many hours of sitting has been my teacher.
