V Ramani

I am interested in realising the brahman in and around us. This is a very 
simple and understandable philosophy. I am trying to understand the 
teaching of Shri Adi Shankara. I do not believe in any religion and a pure 
advaiti. What is remaining for me is the realisation of Brahman. As 
advised by Paramacharya I am doing 24 hours meditation for the past 20 
years. The truth of Advaita is to be understood with Biology and all the 
sciences, society etc. As brahman is eternal, life of human can also be 
eternal by upcoming sciences such as nano technology. Once man becomes 
immortal brahman can be realised by everyone in this world.
