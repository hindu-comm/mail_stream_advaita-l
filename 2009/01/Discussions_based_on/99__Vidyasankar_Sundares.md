May I request members to not engage in prolonged discussions of issues that
are at best peripheral to advaita vedAnta?

Also, please note that the authority of Wikipedia is only as good as the authors
who contribute to articles in it. If you do not like or do not agree with some article,
you are free to become an author on Wikipedia and get involved. There is no
purpose served by discussing Wikipedia articles on the scientific method or Gautama
the Buddha on this list.

Thanks,
Vidyasankar
