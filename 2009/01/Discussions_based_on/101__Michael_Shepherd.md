Dear Bhadraiah,

Michael did not say anything of the sort. He maintains that (in his humble
opinion) Adi Shankara manifested at just the right time to re-assert eternal
truth and its laws..in the society of the time and for all time and beyond
time..

Perhaps you were misled : we use 'lay down the law' in English to mean
're-state the truth'... and of course, rather hope that it will be
followed..

Michael

Apologies. I got involved because Shri Michael posted that Sankara possibly
used laws and other means
instead of logical discussion. Sankara used a generalized scientific method
that not only solved worldly
problems but also adhyatmic problems.

Bhadraiah
