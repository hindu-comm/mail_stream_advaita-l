Namaste,

The Ishvara of patanjali is same as akSara puruSa of gitA.
And Ishvara praNidhAna is no different from highest form of
bhakti.

This is assuming one wants to use yoga sutras in an integrated and
constructive manner with gitA, vedanta - take what you feel is 
useful and leave out complicated themes like kaivalya (if it
is taken to mean a final goal in itself).

Regards,
Shrinivas

pata~njali in his sUtra-s advocates Ishvara, thereby setting his
school marginally apart from the nirIshvaravAdin sAMkhya philosophy.
I would like to know whether this Ishvara in the classical yoga
darshana is merely a sAkShI (a sort of super puruSha among the many
puruSha-s of the sAMkhya school) or also a sRShTi-kartA.
