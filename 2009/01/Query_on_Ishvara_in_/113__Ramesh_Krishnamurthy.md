pata~njali in his sUtra-s advocates Ishvara, thereby setting his
school marginally apart from the nirIshvaravAdin sAMkhya philosophy.

I would like to know whether this Ishvara in the classical yoga
darshana is merely a sAkShI (a sort of super puruSha among the many
puruSha-s of the sAMkhya school) or also a sRShTi-kartA.
