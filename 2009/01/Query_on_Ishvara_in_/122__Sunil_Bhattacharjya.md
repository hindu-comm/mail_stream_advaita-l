Dear Shri ramesh Krishnamurthyji,

Yoga's Ishvara is where the purusha's are anchored to separate itself from the Prakriti but that there is no difference between the purusha and the Ishvara or Brahman is told in Vedanta. Sankhya is Nirishvara but to the advanced students of Sankhya the Svetasvatara upanishad talks about Brahman.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

pata~njali in his sUtra-s advocates Ishvara, thereby setting his
school marginally apart from the nirIshvaravAdin sAMkhya philosophy.

I would like to know whether this Ishvara in the classical yoga
darshana is merely a sAkShI (a sort of super puruSha among the many
puruSha-s of the sAMkhya school) or also a sRShTi-kartA.
