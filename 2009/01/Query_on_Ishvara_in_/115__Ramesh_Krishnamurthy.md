No, I am not talking about integration with gItA or vedAnta but
specifically the position of the classical yoga darshana on Ishvara.
By classical yoga darshana, I mean the system represented collectively
by the yogasUtra-s, the vyAsabhAShya and perhaps the tattvavaishAradI
of vAchaspati mishra.

According to the above system, which of the following are true for Ishvara:
1) sAkShI
2) karmaphaladAtA
3) sRShTi kartA
