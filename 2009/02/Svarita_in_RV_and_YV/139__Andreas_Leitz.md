Dear Sir,
the question you picked up and the discussion is very interesting. How has the svarita to sound? When I asked this my music pandit in Kolkata, he answered, the svarita has always to please the ear. So we have to answer the question, what pleases the ear? When the svarita is sung in tune.The north and south Rv And YV differs, so the sound of svarita should different,too.  I didnŽt find any text dealing with this difficult question, but it might be there are texts. The most important here is the text, not so much the sound.If we ask 5 pandits we will get 5 different answers. 
I am very interested in this subject. If you know or find any Indian text on this, please let me know. Each singer has different voice and tune.Some singers might have hit never the right tune. What is tune in Indian music?
I know for sure, this answer didnŽt satisfy you, but I am loking for a better answer myself. 

With respect and greetings
DR. Andreas Leitz
