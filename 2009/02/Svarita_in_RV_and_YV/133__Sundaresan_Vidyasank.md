Around the beginning of the 20th century, when musicological conferences
became very common, a famous and extremely highly respected musician
dismissed the effort with a remark, "Oh, now they're giving up singing,
so
they can talk about music, huh?"

Trying to verbally describe all the tonal variations in vedic recitation
is a bit
like that! As we got into this topic on this list, I realized that a lot
more
explanation will be needed for many things that are taken for granted
with
respect to terms like svarita. And without an audio demonstration, any
such
explanation will still remain incomplete, not to mention the differences
of
opinion about what a svarita should sound like. This is partly why I
haven't
pursued this thread more vigorously.

Any suggestions from list members will be welcome.
