I completely acknowledge that the general south Indian RV tradition
renders a dIrgha svarita in specific cases where the general south
Indian taittirIya YV tradition renders regular svarita. I do not know
about traditions from other regions, including Kerala.

However, what I am highlighting is that this is NOT a fundamental change
of the tone. It is only a change in the STYLE of rendition of the
svarita. In a regular svarita, as recited in practice, the tone of the
sound directly rises above that of udAtta. In a dIrgha svarita, the
first half of the sound perceptibly stays at the udAtta and the second
half rises above that of udAtta. For all practical purposes, you can
view the dIrgha svarita as a special case of the svarita. It is not a
completely different tone.

Thanks a lot for your clarification...infact I was referring to deergha
svarita in RV  in place regural svarita in YV in some of the maNtra-s where
text (maNtra) donot change....This is where exactly a R^igvedi finds it
difficult to catch up with YV style of  recitation...However, still I am in
dilemma with regard to tone & style which you are talking about...Perhaps,
a practial/personal hearing of these RV & YV maNtra-s from your goodself
would solve my problem...

Thanks onceagain for your time prabhuji

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
