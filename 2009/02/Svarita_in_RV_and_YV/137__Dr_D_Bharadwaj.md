Sri Ramakrishnan,

Namaste
Sorry, there were mistakes in my earlier post. I am reposting it with the
corrections.

You are absolutely right. What is learnt from the right guru,
has been coming down from generations of scholars
who lerant the same way and dedicated themselves to
the practice of this as well as the aspects of the science and art of
traditional recitation. Such a practice, learnt in the right  manner [ i.e.,
according to vidhi], is the final. What is learnt *from the muhka* of the
guru, is the final pramaana in the apaurusheya trdition.

Comparisions with other ways of rendering, which may be 'right' in their own
tradition, is indeed 'meaningless' for the 'practical' purpose of actually
reciting.

May be such a comparitive study may help in the compilation of treatises to
serve some purely intellectual purposes that may, as such, have some passing
value in the present age.
