Dr. Bharadwajji,

Namaste,

Having selected a guru one has to learn the way the guru teaches. However one should not feel that the guru may be annoyed if clarifications are sought even in a polite and humble manner. Once the guru had accepted the disciple it is the duty of the guru also to clear the difficulties of the disciple like Lord Krishna cleared the doubts of Arjuna.

Secondly there are prescribed ways for selecting the right guru and one should follow these norms. One should not select a guru in desperation if one does not get a guru in time or in a nearby place. It is generally believed that right guru comes when the would-be disciple is ready. The would-be disciple may have to go far out to seek a guru and the great Adi Sankaracharya himself did like that.

Further one should be aware that it is also permissible to have more than one guru as and when necessary. If one has learnt what he wanted from a guru then one can go to other guru for the sake of further learning, if he wants to. Ramakrishna Paramhansa took lessons from Bhairavi as well as from other gurus at different times. That may also be one of the reasons why it is said that the advaita principle applies everywhere except in case of guru.

Regards,

SunilK. Bhattacharjya

Sri Ramakrishnan,

Namaste
Sorry, there were mistakes in my earlier post. I am reposting it with the
corrections.

You are absolutely right. What is learnt from the right guru,
has been coming down from generations of scholars
who lerant the same way and dedicated themselves to
the practice of this as well as the aspects of the science and art of
traditional recitation. Such a practice, learnt in the right  manner [ i.e.,
according to vidhi], is the final. What is learnt *from the muhka* of the
guru, is the final pramaana in the apaurusheya trdition.

Comparisions with other ways of rendering, which may be 'right' in
their own
tradition, is indeed 'meaningless' for the 'practical' purpose
of actually
reciting.

May be such a comparitive study may help in the compilation of treatises to
serve some purely intellectual purposes that may, as such, have some passing
value in the present age.
