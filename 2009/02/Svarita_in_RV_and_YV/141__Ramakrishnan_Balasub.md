I think there is a misunderstanding of my position - by a number of
people. The method of pronunciation and other rules are certainly
dictated by the grammar, but in the vedas they may or may not be
adhered to. They do adhere to them _most_ of the time. As Keith says
in his translation to the yajur veda, extremely gross grammatical
errors are also faithfully preserved by the pada-pATha. Surely there
were enough competent grammarians of great stature among the vedic
pundits to correct these. But no one corrected them and the same
uncorrected errors have been faithfully reproduced by pundits from
different geographical areas over a long time  - the reason is that is
what the mantra-draShTa saw, and the duty of the teacher is to only
faithfully reproduce that for his students and not question what the
draShTa saw. The mantra with "errors" has the inherent power, while
the "corrected" version will not. It's kind of a reverse situation
from the indra-Satru example - but these exceptions are known from
tradition only. And so it is with the SrI-sUktam or chanting mantras
in the navagraha-sUktam. It's certainly a good past-time to compare
some versions of recitation of some of the sUktams like the
SrI-sUktam, it's certainly a nicer of way of passing time than many
other ways, and I do that myself. But all I said was that going back
and trying to "correct" mantras based on some supposed ur-version does
not hold any water. Nor do R^ig veda versions have any more intrinsic
validity or "more genuine" than the yajur versions.

More on this later.
