This is an interesting discussion. I am glad this is continuing here
on the list rather than in private.

If I can interject a couple of questions --

What are hrasva and dIrgha svaritas? It would be good if someone can
give an example to illustrate the two. Is it simply a hrasva or dIrgha
svara with svarita intonation?

I was taught that the elongation in svAhA(A)   is a pluta (assuming
that this was intended as a double vertical bar in print).
