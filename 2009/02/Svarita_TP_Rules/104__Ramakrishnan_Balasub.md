I think we are talking at cross-purposes here. My entire mail was
about hrasva and dIrgha *svaritas* (for 1 upward and 2 upward strokes
above the syllable respectively) and not hrasva and dIrgha svaras. As
I mentioned, the word pluta means something quite different in the TP,
and has no connection to the svarita with 2 marks above the syllable.
I suggest going back to my mail and re-reading them.

In short, svara is NOT the same as svarita.
