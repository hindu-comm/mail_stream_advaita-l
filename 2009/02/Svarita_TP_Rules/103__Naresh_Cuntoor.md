Yes. No confusion between svaras in say, music and svaras in TP or in
the Paninian sense. And no confusion between accenting and duration
either.
What I meant was that the elongation at the end in svAhA(A), I thought
was a pluta. Unless I am misunderstanding, you referred to them as
dIrgha svarita (referrign to your comments below). My question was not
about the accent, which is svarita.

If the two upward strokes (eg., above the mI in agnimILe ) is called a
dIrgha, then it would be indistinguishable from the usual dIrgha svara
(which incidentally may be in udAtta/anudAtta). Eg., the dIrgha shI in
 sahasrashIrSha puruShaH.

At any rate, the mI in agnimILe is certainly longer in duration than dIrgha.
