Dear Friends,

I am wondering if there are books available that deal with both theory and practice (such as meditation etc.) of advaita. The reason I am asking is, most of the time the books seem to be full of neo-Vedanta stuff as opposed to advaita as taught by Sankara. It's frustrating. It'd help if someone could point to something more authentic (preferably ones which we can read online).

Hope to hear your thoughts on this.

Warmly,
Suresh
