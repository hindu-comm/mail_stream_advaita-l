Everyone has knowledge of Brahman, as Brahman can never be fully unknown. Most however have only indirect knowledge whereas the GYAnI has direct knowledge.

I've mentioned that although that is possible, there are a couple of reasons why it is more likely that the VC was influenced by the JMV rather than the other way around.

I just find it highly improbable that the author of the JMV would quote and give references to the precise verse numbers of the upadeshasAhasrii, naishhkarmya siddhi, etc. (besides several upanishhads and commentaries) but not provide a single reference to the VC, if the JMV was truly influenced by the VC.
