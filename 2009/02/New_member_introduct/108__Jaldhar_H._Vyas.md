I am a young German man, who studies the Indian music philosophy come down 
to us from oldest time. Found in Vedas, Upanishads and surely the 
different musical scripts we have. I know to read the texts in original 
scripts like Sanskrit and Tamil. My main interest is to understand the 
texts and to discuss them with learned people. I have Pandits for music in 
Kolkata and languages in Kolkata and Pondichery. I am interested in all 
kind of texts dealing with music and philosophy, may be some not well 
known texts. many texts of course I have in form of books or E-Texts at 
home. I know the Sanskrit Insitute of Chennai,but didn´t have the pleasure 
to join it till now. Usually when I stay in Pondichery, I visit the book 
shop and try to find books and texts.The texts I have include the 4 Vedas, 
15 Upanishads some Puranas,the music texts of Bharata Muni, Sarngadeva, 
Matanga, many others like Silappadikaram,texts on poetic like Ananda 
Vardanas Dvanyaloka.I couldn´t list here all the texts. The Texts of music 
and philosophy are very difficult to understand,so it is important to have 
people to discuss them. The Indian music is closed connected to the 
philosophy of Vedanta and Shiva and Shakti.
