Hari Om, this is Satchidananda here , a management professional from 
Bangalore. From childhood in Orissa, I have been inspired into Srimad 
Bhagavatam by my grandfather. Having got initiated in 2003 by my beloved 
Guru Bapuji, I am keen with a ascetic fervor to swim the ocean of Advaita 
to rejoice re-union with my ultimate truth & reality
