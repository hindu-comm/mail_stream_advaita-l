Suresh --

I'm not the wisest or best-informed here to answer your question in full...
but as a Westerner, I have suffered from the problems of Sanskrita in
English translation : 'illusion' suggests some divine deceit to make it more
difficult for humans to be human... the five-fold cosmic set-up includes a
quality more positively called as 'veiling' -- along with another,
'disclosing' -- which tends to be forgotten by more severe Advaitins IMHO...

Michael

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] How to control the mind (without meditation)?



Thanks everyone for all your replies.

The reason I view everything as an illusion is because, Isn't that the right
thing to do? I mean, that's what advaita is about? The world is mithya and
all that? So I assumed that would be the right form of meditation.

In this connection, I'd also like to understand the role of deities here.
Are they real, and if so, do they help us control our minds? If not, (if we
have to do all the work ourselves), what's the point in believing/worshiping
deities? Must they be abandoned as illusions too?

Regards,
Suresh
