Sri Balagopal Ramakrishnan,

Very well said, Sir. Being 'attentive' to the Self is, indeed, the key,
unmistakably and that is undoubtedly 'what' needs to be done. The 'how' is
the question to be discussed. Practices like meditation, calming the mind
etc., IMO, are the optional tools some may want to [ or are able to] do
without and some may choose to take to.






sarvE bhavanthu sukhinah
sarvE santhu niraamayaah
sarve bhadrANi pasyanthu
maa kaschit duhkhabhAg bhavEt.



Regards,
Dr. D. Bharadwaj
