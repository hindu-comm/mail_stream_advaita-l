Dear Shri Surershji,

Yogataravali doessay that mind can be controlled by Meditation (Dhyana). Whereas from Patanjali Yogasutra we know that one has topractise Yama, Niyama,Asana, Pranayama and Pratyahara before the step of Dharana, where one concentrate the mind, before going to the next step of dhyana.Thus it is a two way process.

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Subject: [Advaita-l] How to control the mind (without meditation)?

Dear Friends,

Mind control seems important. But is it possible to do this without meditation?
Because, first off, meditation isn't easy. Second, we need to be in control
at all times, not just during meditation. I normally try to view everything as
an illusion during the waking state, that's all I can do. Meditating on
Brahman is out of question, since Brahman cannot be imagined or thought of in
any form. 

What else can one do to control our thoughts, and not be swept away by this
current? It gets so hard sometimes, I am not exaggerating at all. All kinds of
thoughts come to one's mind, and it's especially hard when they're
emotions like hatred, violence etc. It's like you're a plaything in
their hands. 

Is there some method in advaita (not necessarily meditation, it could be
anything) that can help us conquer all this? I am not exactly the devotional
type either, so praying and bhakti are totally alien to me.

Warmly,
Suresh
