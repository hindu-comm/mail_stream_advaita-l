So there you are, Sureshji ! Because you have the Veda, that is, all
knowledge, within you, all you need is to stay with that eternal witness,
atman, your Self, and all will be revealed when you come out of what you are
not, into what you are !

You probably knew this as a baby; but as you grew up, forgot it; and so,
forgot to tell the rest of us ! So you have to be reminded of the
Kenopanishad and other wisdom...

So do you have the patience...?

With a smile,
Michael

Hari Om Shri Bharadwajji,  Pranaams!

pratibodha-viditaM matam . (Kena II.4)

na anyad dvAram antarAtmanaH vijnAnAya. ataH pratyaya-pratyagAtmatayA
viditaM brahma yadA, tadA tat mataM tat samyag-darshanam iti arthaH.

There is no other door to Its awareness. Therefore when Brahman is known as
the innermost Self (i.e. witness) of cognitions, then is It matam, known,
that is to say, then there is Its complete realization. (shankara-bhAshya
and translation by Sw. GambhIrAnandaji).


In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
