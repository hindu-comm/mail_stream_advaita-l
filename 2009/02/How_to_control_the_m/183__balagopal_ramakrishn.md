HARI AUM

For practical purposes 'mind' is 'self'. Controlling them has to be practised. 'gita' has elaborated this. Put it simply, one has to recognise the superiority of the 'SELF' over all others. This 'SELF', sitting within all, guides rightly. Be attentive and one can listen to 'him'. Letting 'him' taking control is the only  way to exercise effective 'CONTROL'.  To begin with Chapters 3 & 4 of 'gita' has more on this. Just check it out.
