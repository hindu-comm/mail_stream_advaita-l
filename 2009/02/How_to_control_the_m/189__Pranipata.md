Hari Om Shri Bharadwajji,  Pranaams!

There are equivalent upanishadic statements like 'brahmavid apnoti param', 
'yaH brahma veda saH brahma eva bhavati' ....

But 'pratibodha viditam matam' is distinct in the sense it never give room 
for further explanation like though attained, it is not impermanent, though 
become it is not that already you are not etc.

'trivAram satyam'. This statement uses 'bodha', 'vidita' & 'mata' and proves 
'samyag-vijnAna-darshanam'

In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
