Sureshji,

You have answered your own question by your experience. You are already way
ahead of so many people : you have actually seen the mind at its ceaseless
play ! And not wanted it to go on like that.

And it's painful.. but atman, the eternal watcher, is at hand as your
support.. Eventually, if you just stand back and watch the rubbish come and
go, your mind will slowly give up its games, and quieten..

If you're not inclined to use any other method of stilling the mind -- then
this will work -- in time !

Best,
Michael
