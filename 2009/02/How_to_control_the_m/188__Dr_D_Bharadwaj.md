Dear Sri Pranipata,

What more can one say in response to the
powerful upanishadic averment.

This is just to 'explain' terseness
in my earlier post, just in case
it seems unmannerly. :-)




sarvE bhavanthu sukhinah
sarvE santhu niraamayaah
sarve bhadrANi pasyanthu
maa kaschit duhkhabhAg bhavEt.



Regards,
Dr. D. Bharadwaj
