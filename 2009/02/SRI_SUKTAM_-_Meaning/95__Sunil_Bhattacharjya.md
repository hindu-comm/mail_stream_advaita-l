Dear Shri Subramanyaji,

Yes in "Mohamudgaram" also Adi Sankracharya says that emphasis on grammar (alone) will not help.

Best wishes,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear respected members,
There are  lot of hot discussions going on,  on the subject. Dr. Kamesh had
earlier given the meanings of Shiva ashtottara as well as Lakshmi Ashtottara
also.

As pointed
 out by Dr. Yadu, discussions are on the pronunciation, swaras , gm,
M , pluta, udatta, anudatta, swarita, dirgha swarita, etc.than on the meanings.

I am reminded of a stanza from the great advaita text "Viveka
chudamani"
"shabdajalam maharaNyam chittabhramaNa kAraNam, ataha prayatnA jnatavyam
tatvajnai tatvamAtmanah" -60.

Hence I request the members to examine whether the meanings given are correct,
convey the thought meant to be conveyed etc instead of getting stuck in the web
of shabdajalam.

Here I quote a few names where I doubt the translation, ( only a few quoted ,
just for example, there may be many).

Lakshmi Ashtottara
Indu sheetalya namah - pure like moon (  translation) where as sheetal means
cold like moon (Coolness like chandra- shila- read the last stanza of soundarya
lahari- chandropajalai arghya is quoted)
Preeta pushkarinye namaha -  Pushkarini doesnot mean eyes which Dr. K Rao
 has
given
Siddhiye namaha -  meaning given as 'protector' where as Siddhi means
achievements

Shiva Ashtottara:
Pinakine namaha - meaning given as lord who gaurds the path of dharma where as
it means one who is holding Pinaka in his hand.(Pinaka hasta)
Nila lohitaya namaha - you have given as lord - red as rising sun whereas nila
means blue hue.
lalatakshaya namaha-  meaning given as 'sports of creation' - Actually
it should be one who has eye on his forehead.

Sri Sukta
Ardra is given as wet; Though the verbatim meaning is correct, the same refers
to Goddess who is compassionate who liquifies (drava) for the devotees's
dukha.

May I request the learned members to discuss on the contents and meanings than
on the grammar, gm, M etc

However I appreciate Dr K Rao's efforts in translation. We can expect few
more translations from his stable like Purusha sukta, durga sukta, soura
 sukta,
navagraha sukta and other shlokas whose meanings are not available easily.
With regards
Subramanya UH
