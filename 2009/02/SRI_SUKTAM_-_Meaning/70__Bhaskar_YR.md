shrIsUktam as per rk samhitA mentions as pashUnAM only.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

When we are reciting Sri Suktam as per R^ig vEda saMhitA, we recite
'IshwareeM' sarva bhutAnAM ( not IshwareegaM)So pashunAM also correct way
of pronounciation as per R^ig vEda..Anyway, as we know *svara-s* change
from R^ig to yaju..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
