Pranams, 



I am curious to know if paSUnAM contains a plutam.



The cases that need a gm point to vyana. As per Ch.U

I.3.3 vyana is indicated by absence of inhaling or

exhaling. All guttural (should be same for glottal stop)

contraction of stomach muscles is a requirement. 



In case of plutam (triple svara) udana is involved,

because the word plutam is derived from the root

plavana (float). For udana also there is no inhaling or

exhaling (similar to vyana), but then this udana is

higher than vyana as it also involves expansion of

chest. So bringing down a plutam to vyana level is not

fair. 



If paSUnAM is a straight deerghaM (double the

svara) the above discussion is not relevant. 



Please advise what is appropriate, and if you see a

difference of opinion.  



Regards

Bhadraiah
