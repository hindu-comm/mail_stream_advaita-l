I am referring to the seven sUtras immediately following these three in
the taittirIya prAtiSAkhya - from tasyAdir uccaistarAm udAttAd antare
...
up to  ... pravaNa ity eke. I see a very clear application of these
rules in
the svaras used in a mantra such as tryambakaM yajAmahe, as also
in the construction of the vikRti pATha-s (jaTA, ghana etc.)

But all this gets to be too technical, so perhaps we can discuss
privately?
