Hari Om Shri Bhaskarji,  Pranaams!

The mantrapuShpam book of Ramakrishna Mission, shrIsUktam as per rk samhitA 
mentions as pashUnAM only.

I do not know whether we can say as a rule w.r.t. chhAndasa but we generally 
see the anusvAra when followed by UShmavarna(sibilants) / 
mahAprANa(aspirate), changes to gm

I also await comments/confirmation from this group.

In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
