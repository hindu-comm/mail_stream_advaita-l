Michael - PraNAms

Not sure if the above statement is correct either. Vedanta points to us- from  vyavahaarika to paramaarthika - from relative to absolute- the process of how and why have to be transcended along with cause-effect relations in 'going' from one to the other, since it is not a process that can be definable in terms of why or how, since descriptions falls short - yatho vaacho nivartante apraapya manasaa saha - the words and the mind cannot reach there. 
The transition is discontinuous; hence Shankara aptly calls that anirvacaniiyam, inexplicable - yet absolutely real.

Hari Om!
