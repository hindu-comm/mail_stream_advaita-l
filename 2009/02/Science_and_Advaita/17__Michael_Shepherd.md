Gentlemen,

I've recalled from earlier fruitless proofreading of the Encyclopaedia of
Hinduism : 'samshaya' is the Sanskrita for 'doubt' and there are said to be
five stages to it; it's neither true nor false; and in the Encyclopaedia
entry, it was related to the analogy of mind confronting snake/wood..

Michael

Dear Naresh,

Thank you also for those useful comments. Following you comment on vyaapti,
I'm now deep in reading about anumaana --- and not finding it easy going !
But I'm well aware that Sanskrit is a far subtler medium of thought than
Western languages..so I'll persevere..

Best wishes,
Michael

Words in Sanskrit tend to have a larger vyaapti (denotion?) than their
English counterparts.

kasmaat = why=for what reason. As is kimartham.
kasmaat, kutaH are also used to denote  'from where'.

Saying that kasmaat/kimartham denotes "for what reason", but does not
denote 'why' is nonsensical.

Incidentally, the English word 'why' is etymologically equivalent to
"for what purpose"!

Investigation, contemplation, etc. are prescribed in the Indian
systems as well. Eg., draShTavyaH, shrotavyaH, mantavyaH,
nididhyAsitavyaH.
