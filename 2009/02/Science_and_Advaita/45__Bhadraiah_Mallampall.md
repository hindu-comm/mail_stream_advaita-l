Dear list members

Some of you may have seen philo.demon.co.uk site which contained excellent commentaries on styles of discourse and other adhyatmic matters. This site was taken down couple of years ago, and I thought it was lost forever. 

You can check its archives at waybackmachine. 

http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://philo.demon.co.uk/Darshana.htm

You may see some interesting pages

http://web.archive.org/web/20041214133008/www.philo.demon.co.uk/verbal.htm

You can also check for other sites missing now, or versions thereof. 

Regards
Bhadraiah
