Dear Michael,

>How can Advaita be 'tedious' when it is the corner-stone of the universe,>present behind every thought?

Sorry my bad English, I meant rigorous. (Tedious means long and tiring but it can also mean boring.) Some of the typical lectures on Advaita can indeed be tedious (boring) when delivered by "professional speakers". You should really read it peacefully or discuss in small groups.  

Regards
Bhadraiah
