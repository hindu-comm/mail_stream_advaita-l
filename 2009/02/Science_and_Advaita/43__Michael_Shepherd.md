Dear Ramesh,

That's brilliant ! Thank you for the heads-up..

Such a system of writing and editing should help, both to pin down the
context and system, and also to widen the practical application -- as for
example with the 'Five stages of doubt': relating 'doubt' to Nyaya,
Shankara, and any other interpreter.. That breadth of mind is/was very
apparent in the (not many..) best essays submitted to the 'Encyclopaedia of
Hinduism' -- which hopefully may yet see print..

I hope the admirable John Grimes is asked to participate -- he has that
breadth of reference.

Michael

While Micheal has already gone into some detail on the 'Encyclopaedia
of Hinduism' project, there is also a new effort at producing an
online encyclopedia (hindupedia.com). The external format is somewhat
like wikipedia except that articles can be written/edited only by
people authorized to do so. As of now, a few sincere individuals are
involved but there is ample room for top notch scholars to contribute
and the existing team is actively looking out for high quality
contributors.

Ramesh
