While Micheal has already gone into some detail on the 'Encyclopaedia
of Hinduism' project, there is also a new effort at producing an
online encyclopedia (hindupedia.com). The external format is somewhat
like wikipedia except that articles can be written/edited only by
people authorized to do so. As of now, a few sincere individuals are
involved but there is ample room for top notch scholars to contribute
and the existing team is actively looking out for high quality
contributors.
