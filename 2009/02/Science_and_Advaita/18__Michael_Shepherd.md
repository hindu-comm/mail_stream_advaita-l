Dear Dr Bharadwaj,

Thank you for that lucid explanation -- with which I'm very happy...I
wouldn't seek to add complications of language to the discussion !

This may be my fantasy : but I can see that in an oral tradition stemming
from satsanga in the presence of the guru or the rishi, 'Please inform me
further..' is more appropriate and useful than a challenging  'Why do you
say that?' (which I guess Adi Shankara had to face quite frequently on his
travels ?...)

 I wouldn't want to defend Western 'doubt' which arises when considering
inadequate sources, or writings in place of the sattvic presence of the
guru; and above all from the conceited sense of separate identity..

But if I had to defend the place of 'doubt' in the scientific process, as
illusion confronted, i would say that the recognition of doubt is a first
step to removing it !

But I don't despair of the Western mind at its height : as a poet, I hold
those two principles mentioned, of the One in the many, and the magic of
Creation, at the front of my creative mind; and trust that there are
scientists as well as spiritual leaders who do the same !

Best wishes and thanks,
Michael

Dear Sri Michael,

<<Your comments on 'Why?' seem to contradict those of others here ?>>

There is no contradiction here if we closely see whatever is being said by
us. Anyway you had yourself inserted the word 'seem' there.

Ancient Indian mind, being absolutely clear, avoided the 'why'
in the usual Western sense of investigating the possible reasons within the
ambit of the ill lit mind, and instead used, sensibly, the words like 'what'
is the cause, 'what' is the purpose, from 'what'
[kasmaat] etc. As Sri Bhadriah rightly pointed out is as good as
'why'.....as in the English language there is no convention of using the
phrases  equivalents of kimartham and kutah/kasmat, the word 'why' is
passable, in discussions in English.

Let me explain the reason for my bringing up the absence of
a direct 'why' in the Deva Bhaasha.

Sanskrit being a language used by the ancient Indian Rshis, the drastas, the
seers, they were interested in seeing or witnessing 'what is' manifest [and
'is' but not manifest] and expressing at will [ or if when felt permission
to express].  They 'saw' and and gave expression, at wil, to the truth as it
'is' with finality and certainity.....not an investigating, groping,
trail-and-error-based, hypothetical 'could have beens' and 'would have
beens'.

In the West, truth is investigated by the ill lit mind
using the self proclaimed 'doubting' method.
They had apotheosized doubt. It is accorded highest place for getting
knowledge!  We can keep doubting, doubting
and doubting endlessly. The process of such an investigation can go on and
on to make one doubt the very existence of any truth.

Here in the East, at least in Ancient India, truth was 'seen'
by the people who had overcome or 'won over' the mind
and obtained deeper faculties and were 'certain'. Indian Shastra is
Rshiproktam. Shraddha is glorified here and accorded the highest place for
getting knowledge. Shraddha is is the opposite of samshaya.
