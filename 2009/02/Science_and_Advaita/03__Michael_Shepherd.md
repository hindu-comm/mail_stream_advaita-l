Dear Sadananda --

Point taken ! But questions take us on usefully to that point where words
'turn back',  can go no further !

Not sure if the above statement is correct either. Vedanta points to us-
from  vyavahaarika to paramaarthika - from relative to absolute- the process
of how and why have to be transcended along with cause-effect relations in
'going' from one to the other, since it is not a process that can be
definable in terms of why or how, since descriptions falls short - yatho
vaacho nivartante apraapya manasaa saha - the words and the mind cannot
reach there.
The transition is discontinuous; hence Shankara aptly calls that
anirvacaniiyam, inexplicable - yet absolutely real.

Hari Om!
