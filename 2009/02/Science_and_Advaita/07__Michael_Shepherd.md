Dear Dr  Bharadwaj,

Thank you for that. 'Kimartham' exactly expresses the real intention of the
question 'Why?' as e.g. the rishis ask in the Aitareya.

 Sanskrit is so polite -- 'By whose authority ?' 'Inform me further,
please..'

Michael

Sri Kuntimaddi,

Very well said. True, as a matter of fact there is no
'why' of things for the mind to know. It takes only the 'how'
and 'what'. Why is too deep, profound and inscrutable.

Indian vedantic spirituality is well aware of this fact.
There is no pursuit of 'why' at all....only the 'what' and the 'how'.
The 'what' and the 'how' are usually 'known' by
observation witnessing.... the 'why' can be known usually by research and
application of the 'mind' ...

The karya - karana explanations of 'nyaaya' are also an extended 'how' if we
look closely. They are the answers to kasmaat or kimartham.
Tarkam is NOT 'logic'.

Interestingly, Sanskrit language has no word for 'why' at all.
We use either kutah/ kasmaat [ from what] or kimartham [for what purpose].






Regards,
Dr. D. Bharadwaj
