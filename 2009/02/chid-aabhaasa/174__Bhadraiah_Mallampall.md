Theoretically nothings stops us from defining terms like nAmAbhAsa, manAbhAsa, etc going till prANAbhAsa. 



But Chit can very well cognize all its subordinates name to saMkalpa, as well as its superiors up to PraNa. So Chidabhasa is the most practical and representative term. The suffix ABAsa has a higher scope but applied by tradition to only one instance to illustrate a point which should be good enough for discussion. 



Back to the confusion about the inert quality of Chit - If any one has complaints about, one can stop worrying and simply choose to adopt a higher entity that is not inert, but an active creator.  



Regards

Bhadraiah
