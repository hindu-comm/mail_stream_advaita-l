The only reasonably widely available edition of the Panchadashi is the one
with English translation by Swami Swahananda of the Ramakrishna mission.
His translation is based on the commentary of Ramakrishna.  (Note this is
a different person than the 19th century Bengali saint.)

As I understand it, chidabhasa refers to the entire buddhi-manas-ahamkara
conceptual framework. (What I think Sadananda is refering to as BMI.)  It
is inert in the sense that it is only a reflection of the atman.
