Long ago I got acopy of Panchdashi from the Sringeri math when I went there. Probably it will still be vailable there.

As regards the BMI (Body,Mind and Intellect), to my knowledge this terminology is from the Chinmayanada school.

The only reasonably widely available edition of the Panchadashi is the one with
English translation by Swami Swahananda of the Ramakrishna mission. His
translation is based on the commentary of Ramakrishna.  (Note this is a
different person than the 19th century Bengali saint.)

As I understand it, chidabhasa refers to the entire buddhi-manas-ahamkara
conceptual framework. (What I think Sadananda is refering to as BMI.)  It is
inert in the sense that it is only a reflection of the atman.
