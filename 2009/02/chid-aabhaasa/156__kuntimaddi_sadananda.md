Bhadraiahji - PraNams

The term inertness is used in the sence  of Keshtram. That is why it is called mithyaa - sat asat vilakshaNa - it is there, it is not there like a pot depending on what reference the pot is talked about.  If I know that it is not there in reality, the problem is solved. No question of realization too and this discussion using the so called inert computer also has last its charm.

If you do not see any inertness in the universe, My saaShTanga praNAms to you sir.

My comunication is only at kshetam level Otherwise myself and Michael both will be just silent - atho vaacho nivartante apraapya manasaa saha. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

Dear Shri Chidananda,



You said;

>Yet intellect itself is inert but intellect is required for realization. 



How could intellect be inert? How can anything be inert if consciousness is everywhere?

How can an inert object help us in realization?

Bhadraiah
