Hello all,

Please ignore the mail with the above subject line. It has been
auto-sent from unyk.com, not from a member of this list.

A request to all members on Advaita-L:

When signing up for services such as unyk.com or reunion.com etc, to
manage your email contacts, please double-check and triple-check all
your options before you click the final button. A mailing list that you
are subscribed to is very different from a personal email contact, but
these websites do not make that distinction and start sending out
automatic emails to everyone in your address book or mail inbox.

Thanks,
Vidyasankar
