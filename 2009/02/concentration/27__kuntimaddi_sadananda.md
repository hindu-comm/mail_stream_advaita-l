Naga Bhushan - PraNAms

The best way to develop concentration and meditation on any subject is to disciple the mind by conscious effort. If you follow these steps both your memory and your study will improve.

First get up early- After bath sit in a quiet place and do your prayers and do half hour of meditation on Gayatri mantra. - learn with the meaning and dwell on the meaning, feeling intensely in your mind as you repeat the mantra.
Daily without any exception. This gives both physical and metal discipline needed to concentrate the mind on any task that it is involved. 
It will also makes your mind subtle and free from agitations so that it can easily absorb new knowledge.  Essentially the capacity of your intellect will improve. It will also help you in your spiritual development. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
