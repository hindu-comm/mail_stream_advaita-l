Dear Balagopalji,

If the physical health is good and there is no excessive mental stress then practice do hold the key. In medical parlance, to keep something in memory, a pathway has to be formed and that formation requires practice and the amount of practice required will depend on several factors including the age of the person.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Namasthe,

'Concentration' per
 se is the most inportant requisite in achieving
success in any venture-mental, physical, intellectual, devotional and spiritual.
So it will be easy once the mind agree to succeed.

Essentially it is all about controlling the mind and keeping it focussed. This
is what Arjuna said' VERY VERY DIFFICULT' to which his mentor too agreed
but with a string-CAN OVERCOME WITH PRACTISE & DETACHMENT.

PRACTISE is an activity repeated. One will do it only if:

1) forced (like in jobs with bosses/ business with capital involved/ other risk
& liability carrying activities)
2) with a strong purpose

First is easy because external forces motivates (in a negative way and hence
not sustainable overtime) whereas the second is what requires a definite
clarrity on the 'WHY'.

Figure out the 'WHY' and this will help to adopt and practise the
suitable and sustainable method of developing
 concentration.

Regards

Balagopal
