Dear Sadanadaji andBhadraiahji,

There is still another method as described by Sri Aurobindo. Thoughts float around you. Observe and do not accept the first thought that approaches you . You will find that the thought will go away. Then another thought will come but do not react andthis thoughttoo will go away. Continue this practice till you have control over thought. Sri aurobindo isolated himself completely for three days (including nights)without talking to anybody and could control this thought rejection and thus he attained theability tocontrol the mind.

One should alsoconsiderthe pre-requisites Patanjali prescibed before one practises concentration. These are Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama and Pratyahar. This means one should observe the codes of personal and societal rules and regulations, do the yogic asana practices, do the breath control exercises and shun the desire have what belongs to others, for success in developing concentration.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Shri Sadananda, 

There is a radically opposite approach to concentration - it's fully
advaita based. 

1. Let the mind wander where it wants. No need to restrain, but remember
that...

2. Every part of the body or mind is an asset (being rtviks/devas/devikas). So
every thought we get is just an instruction from these rtviks/devas. It is just
that we do not recognize the devas and we don't understand the message. No
need to get discouraged yet... 

3. Don't take the easy way out interpreting these messages as saying that
mind likes this or that object or idea. After all I have created all this, so
why do I need my created objects again? So wanting this or that object is
definitely not the "message", what else can it be? Think..

4. If you can't find an answer, leave it to the system iteself! Call it
"unknown". Let the system interpret the message and let it decide the
course of action. 

5. You will usually end up taking the right action as per dharma. 

Regards
Bhadraiah
