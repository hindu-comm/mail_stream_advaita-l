Dear Shri Sadananda, 

There is a radically opposite approach to concentration - it's fully advaita based. 

1. Let the mind wander where it wants. No need to restrain, but remember that...

2. Every part of the body or mind is an asset (being rtviks/devas/devikas). So every thought we get is just an instruction from these rtviks/devas. It is just that we do not recognize the devas and we don't understand the message. No need to get discouraged yet... 

3. Don't take the easy way out interpreting these messages as saying that mind likes this or that object or idea. After all I have created all this, so why do I need my created objects again? So wanting this or that object is definitely not the "message", what else can it be? Think..

4. If you can't find an answer, leave it to the system iteself! Call it "unknown". Let the system interpret the message and let it decide the course of action. 

5. You will usually end up taking the right action as per dharma. 

Regards
Bhadraiah
