Dear Srinivasji,

You may be aware that Patanjali had given a hint towards alternative simple methods also. If we wish to consider those methods then the simplest among them could probably be taking Ayurvedic tablets containing Brahmi or Saraswati herbs. There are some more simple methods too.

Regards,

Sunil Kumar Bhattacharjya

Namaste,

With due respects to other methods of meditation/ concentration advocated by
Shri Bhadraiah, and Shri Bhattacharjya, for a person in school/ college a more
traditional approach as suggested by Shri Sadananda is most suitable, tested
and safe.

(A person more mature in age, can explore other methods along with the risks
involved).

Best regards,
Shrinivas

The best way to develop concentration and meditation on any subject is to
disciple the mind by conscious effort. If you follow these steps both your
memory and your study will improve.
First get up early- After bath sit in a quiet place and do your prayers and do
half hour of meditation on Gayatri mantra. - learn with the meaning and dwell on
the meaning, feeling intensely in your mind as you repeat the mantra.
Daily without any exception. This gives both physical and metal discipline
needed to concentrate the mind on any task that it is involved. 
It will also makes your mind subtle and free from agitations so that it can
easily absorb new knowledge. Essentially the capacity of your intellect will
improve. It will also help you in your spiritual development. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda
