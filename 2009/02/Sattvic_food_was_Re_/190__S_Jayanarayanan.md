Your question is similar to Arjuna's lament to Krishna in the Gita 6.34: "The mind is restless, like the wind. I do not see any way to restrain it."

Krishna replies that it is possible by regular practice and withdrawal from sense-pleasures.

If one is truly keen on subduing the mind, I would recommend reading Ramana Maharshi's "Who am I?", especially the answers to questions 8-13. The answer to #12 contains a gem of an advice, because literally everyone can practice it (compare Gita 17.8) irrespective of their physical or mental makeup:

  "Of all the restrictive rules, that relating to the
  taking of sattvic food in moderate quantities is the best; by
  observing this rule, the sattvic quality of mind will increase,
  and that will be helpful to Self-enquiry."

Some websites to learn about Sattvic foods:

Ramana Bhagavan once said that "kanji" or "congee" (Rice porridge that is lightly salted and spiced, may contain vegetables http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congee ) is one of the very best Sattvic foods there is. Another small tip, may be useful: a diet with a good amount of rice and yoghurt (curd) or buttermilk (instead of rather than along with milk) is excellent.
