Hari Om Shri Sureshji,  Pranaams!

I presume your question is, when you have a knowledge how can an experience 
contrary to that knowledge happen and believed.

Vedanta puts the same question with respect to waking state also.

When you have clear knowledge that it is your body that is thin, short, your 
organs that are weak or strong, your mind that is dejected or elated, how 
come you are able to experience I am thin, I am short, I am strong, I am 
weak, I am happy, I am miserable, etc. When you have clear knowledge that 
your last experience with object did not give you satisfactory/lasting 
happiness, how come again and again you long for the same object and expect 
satisfactory/lasting happiness from it.

The problem is not in the state(avastha) but the mind choosing to believe 
contrary to past experiences.

Hence advise to the mind - artham anartham bhAvaya; doSha drSThyA muhuH 
muhuH ....

In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
