Sunilji - PraNAms

As I  Understand:

Can the dreams not be related to the actions of the past births?

It is just as simple as to state that any creation involves knowledge of creation. Hence even the dream creator should have the knowledge to create - that knowledge gained from the past. That it relates to past samskaara is definite and how past that past should be- your judgment is as good as mine.

Sunil:

Only a realized soul can see his or her past lives clearly and the rest can probably have a peep into those only in their dreams in a random manner. 

KS: Sunilji, The above statement is a statement of declaration. I have no basis to say yes or no.

Sunil:

Our present birth is based on our past Karma  and in dreams we may be seeing some sort of explanations of our present leanings in terms of our past actions. A person who is of very kind disposition may see in his dream that he is very cruel to people and it may be that he was so in his past life and realization of that made him kind in this life but he does see that link in the present waking state.

KS: The key word in the above para is 'May see' - Kind disposition comes with discipline. Suppressions can be initial emotional or reaction states that can arise as mental and sensuous response to situations, which for a more balanced person are sublimated while those who are still evolutionary ladder they get suppressed. Suppressed ones will get exhausted in the dream since intellect is at low level compared to the mind - That is the discriminative faculty, the intellect is low so that mind can project those suppressed reactions. Nature has provided the dream state as exhaust mechanism. You only exhaust the vaasanaas without accumulate the new ones. It is a relief mechanism. Even the extreme states like somnambulism etc are repressed states motivating even physical action without the discriminative intellect aware of it. 

This is the basics = the rest one can speculate.


Hari Om!
