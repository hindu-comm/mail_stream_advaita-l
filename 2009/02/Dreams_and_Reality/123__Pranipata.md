Hari Om Shri Sunil Bhattacharjyaji,  Pranaams!

And the lethargic half awake half asleep one enters dream, feel hungry as if
not eaten for days, start briskly preying and has a sumptuous food again
........

Can we say experience is true, no imagination.


In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
