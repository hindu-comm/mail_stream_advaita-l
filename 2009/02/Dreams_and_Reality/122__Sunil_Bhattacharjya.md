Dear Pranipataji,

Quote

Experiencing heaviness in carrying when the food was external to
the body and not so when consumed! Since both cannot be true, both has
to be imagination only.

Unquote

Can we really say that there is no difference between these two cases and both cannot be true? In one case the weight is supported by one extremity and the blood-supply from the heart has a load on it, which should be different from the load experienced on taking food as in the latter case the blood will rush to the stomach to aid digestion and one may consequently feel lethargic and one's brain may not like to be active t that time. The above simile really do not help much.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Hari Om Shri Michaelji,  Pranaams!

Yes. Vedanta is simple and direct.

If one agrees dream is imagination, what need to put machines on some other
sleeping person to find more how one imagines!

Now narration of an incident in form of story.

Someone walking with his food-packet, got an increasing feeling that luggage is
very heavy and hard to carry as day progressed. So he sat down, ate the food,
continued the journey walking not feeling the weight of luggage anymore.

Experiencing heaviness in carrying when the food was external to the body and
not so when consumed! Since both cannot be true, both has to be imagination
only.

cittakAlAH hi ye antaH tu dvayakAlAH ca ye bahiH.
kalpitAH eva te sarve visheShaH na anya hetukaH..(Mandukya Karika 2.14)
Things that exist internally as long as the thought lasts and things that are
externally related to two points of time, are all imaginations. Their
distinction is not caused by anything else.

In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya

There are recorded occasions of scientific discoveries made during dream :
which suggests that the old association of dreams with 'artistic
dreaming'
or 'creative dreaming' may well be correct : the mind free of other
states,
awareness of actuality or non-awareness.

What is most extrordinary is the totally different individual dreams that
re-occur !

It suggests that dreams confront us, in that mysterious state, with
untruth -- as if we construct cheap novels of our life, which are recognised
to be untrue on waking -- as indeed, as one gets older, one's life seems
more and more a dream which only slightly approximates to reality !

Michael
