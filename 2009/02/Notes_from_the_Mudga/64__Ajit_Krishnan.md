namaste,

The Mudgala Purana is one of the two puranas dedicated entirely to Ganesha.
It is written in simple sanskrit, and is permeated with a nice advaita
flavour. While I was reading it, I jotted down some notes. I lost the
original document in a hard-drive crash, and don't think I'll be retyping it
in the near future. So, here is a pdf document with some notes from the
Mudgala Purana.
