Magesh,

There are several books on learning Sanskrit now, including one in the
extensive 'Teach Yourself' series -- which some Sanskrit teachers favour for
its translation texts from original shastras.

For a general survey, 'A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy' by Radhakrishnan
and Charles Moore, has selected texts in English translation from Advaita
etc.

It's not everybody's choice, but Kauai's 'Dancing with Shiva' Shaivite
website reprints some serious discussions on parents and children in the
Hindu tradition.

Finally, the 'Hindupedia' website has been specifically set up to acquaint
the children of the diaspora with their tradition. It's still in process of
development, but in my opinion it already contains some exemplary articles,
both original and selected from elsewhere. It manages to steer a sensible
line for contemporary Hindus, IMHO.

Michael

Subject: [Advaita-l] Learning sanskrit and structured learning of
Hinduism



Hello Everyone,
I have joined this group very recently... Excellent to see the
discussions by many learned people.
I am doing my PhD in UK. I consider myself 0 in sprituality. have only
patch knowledge here and there.

Thanks to Ananya Parek - I wanted to raise the same question "Readings
for Beginners" and others for answering to the thread.

I have two doubts

- Is there any book for self-study material for learning Sanskrit? My
long held wish.

- Forgive my ignorance.
I think...... Hinduism is not taught in a structed way to kids in the
right age. Have we failed in that aspect?
Considering the way other religions show so much respect for their
teachings, worship and rituals, Do we have proper means of imparting
knowledge to a growing kid?
I dont want to blame my father for this. I don't remember doing a
systematic study. Owing to the environment I grew, I have listened to
mantras and chanting from young age. I have good retention (memory)
and It is easy for me to pickup. But no structured learning...
There is also saying knowledge without guru is kind of meaningless and
would be patchy....
Your thoughts on this for future generation.

Thanks & best wishes
Magesh N
