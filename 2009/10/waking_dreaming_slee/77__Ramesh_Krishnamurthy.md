Dear Michael,

I did not really understand your question at all, but a few points:

There is really no such thing as an "experience" of turiya. The term
turiya is only used to indicate that which is common to, but not
affected by (and hence "transcends") the regular mental states such as
waking, dreaming and deep sleep. In short, turiya is nothing but the
Atman, which is present in all states. So if at all, we may say that
turiya is "experienced" all the time, in all our regular states.

If you claim to had a specific experience of turiya, it could have
been some kind of samadhi, perhaps a foretaste of samadhi. However,
samadhi per se is not mukti. Mukti in advaita is jnana only. Samadhi
when understood properly can be a powerful aid in assimilating jnana
(a beautiful example is provided in the book "Yoga Enlightenment &
Perfection of Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswaminah") but in itself it
is neither necessary nor sufficient.

Ramesh
