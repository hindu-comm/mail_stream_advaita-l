Kindly pardon my ignorance...I am not able to corelate your statement with 
Smt. Savitri mAtAji's 'avasthA traya mail'....Could you please elaborate 
with more details.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

As I understand it, the three avasthAs are completely mutually exclusive 
and independent of one another. The gist of the tenet is this.

Namaste,

In that case, I am afraid, all the rishis wasted their time in formulating 
and teaching
innumerable vidyA-s/ upAsanA-s. Probably, at the top of the list of these 
rishis who
wasted their time in such pursuits is pAtanjali.
