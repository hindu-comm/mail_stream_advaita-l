praNAms Sri Kathirasan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

prabhuji dont utter a single word against 'socalled' traditional 
beliefs...if you do that you have to be ready to face some histrionics 
eruptions:-))  Kindly let these things go...it is there in the tradition 
(!!??) for thousands of years and nobody dared to question these issues 
due to fear of eccentric & lunatic attacks from socalled traditionalists 
:-)) Hope you understand the pathetic situation & keep silence :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
