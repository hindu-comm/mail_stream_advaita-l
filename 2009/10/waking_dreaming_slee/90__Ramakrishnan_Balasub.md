I deliberately put "further away" in quotes for the very same reason.
As made clear in the mANDUkya bhAShya, turIya is the underlying
reality, not the 4th separate quarter as in the quarters of a coin.
The issue is that it is near for the sAdhaka with the right 4-fold
qualifications, the Atman is indeed near. Turning the mind inwards
does not come easy, which is why we have all the different karmas and
upAsanas. If I hear once more about how we just have to give up the
idea of NOT being realized to become realized, I'll barf all over my
screen.
