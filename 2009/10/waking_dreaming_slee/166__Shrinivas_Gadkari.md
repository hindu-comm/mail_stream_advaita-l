Namaste Shri Bhaskar,

In this message thread we are discussing how one may use interaction/
influence between the three/ four states of consciousness in our sAdhanA.

If we say these states and independent of each other, I assume we are 
also implying that they do not interact with each other or influence 
each other. In that case validity of vidyA-s as I understand them is 
questionable.

Regards,
Shrinivas
