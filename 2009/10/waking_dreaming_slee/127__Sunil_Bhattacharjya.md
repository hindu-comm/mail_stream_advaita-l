It is not a horizotal structure accommodating all. It is a pyramidal structure accommodating all and having Advaita at the top.

This statement is absolutely correct. All the darshanas included. I am not 
referring to Kathirajanji but the modern academic philosophers do not 
appear to understand this.

If advaita vedanta as advocated by shankara is a compartment of 'all 
inclusive darshana-s' why shankara has taken all the trouble to point out 
the defects & refute the siddhAnta of sAnkhya, yOga, nyAya, bauddha, pUrva 
meemAmsa etc. in his prasthAna trayi works?? It is not easy to conclude 
in such a way that the advaita is a land of 'multiple' path-s, coz. 
shankara is so meticulous when recommending his saMpradAya's path.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
