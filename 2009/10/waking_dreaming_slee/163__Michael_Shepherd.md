Nmaste Shrinivas,

Thank you for that response. It brings me back to my original question, as
to how much the states of consciousness are mutually supportive.

I'm sure you are right. If we take Kabir or Tagore -- aren't they creating
'visions of truth' from all these states -- perhaps one could say from
turiya itself ?

And doesn't fine literature appeal to the same state in the reader as thge
writer ?

In which case, can we say that fine literature brings these states together
usefully, in ourselves as we read ? Common sense says it does ?

Plato seems to have had the same problem in the European tradition : how to
relate poetry to philosophy !

Michael

Namaste Michael,
(please address me simple as Shrinivas, without "ji")

I think any serious student of veda/vedAnta/yoga will subscribe to "dream"
state including 'mental activity'.The term "day dreaming"is no
coincidence.

I would not jump to a conclusion that 'visions of truth' are a product of
interaction between "dream" and "awake" states alone. Based on my
understanding
they involve the other two states as well. However, the "vision" that is
part
of the 'visions of truth',most likely becomes evident in "dream" state.

Regards,
Shrinivas

Thanks for that. I'm trying to find whether 'dream' or taijasa can be
redefined legitimately as 'mental actiivity' and thus incorporate not only
nightly 'dreaming' and envisioning, but also the envisioning of poets and
writers -- and by extension, the very Veda and Upanishads and Mahabharata
etc, as created 'visions of truth'.
And that, without offending the pandits...!
Michael
