Ramesh,

Realize that there is a modern school which prides itself on its being
clueless in this regard. Their whole existence is based on the supreme
pride that they alone are the key-holders to the door of
"pristine-pure" vedaanta, whatever the heck that means. The founders
of this school started off in Western education, were not taught by
traditional pundits, and they have lot of pride on discovering things
by themselves by reading books. So it's like banging your head against
a brick wall - best to avoid it, go away and leave them to wallow in
their own theories.

Rama
