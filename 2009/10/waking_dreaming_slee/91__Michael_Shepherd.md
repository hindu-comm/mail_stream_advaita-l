Ramaji

Now stand well away from your screen...atman is so near, the sages tell us,
that we can be aware of its presence between every one of the tens of
thousands of thoughts or desires which we 'entertain' during the day..

I find that a glorious promise, consolation for my brain weary with reading
too many commentaries on the sacred texts.. and very practical.

So I'll not point out that for you/us, it's only the idea of not... :-)

Michael

I deliberately put "further away" in quotes for the very same reason.
As made clear in the mANDUkya bhAShya, turIya is the underlying
reality, not the 4th separate quarter as in the quarters of a coin.
The issue is that it is near for the sAdhaka with the right 4-fold
qualifications, the Atman is indeed near. Turning the mind inwards
does not come easy, which is why we have all the different karmas and
upAsanas. If I hear once more about how we just have to give up the
idea of NOT being realized to become realized, I'll barf all over my
screen.

Rama
