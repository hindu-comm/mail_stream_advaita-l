Yes it is.

If people want to imagine that they have essentially the same brain
matter as Einstein and hence they should be as good in Physics - well
it's up to them.

It's no different in advaita. Just as Einsteins past samskaras helped
him do certain things effortlessly, some people have worked on the 4
fold qualifications harder in previous lives - for them advaita
j~naana is "effortless". All these fake, so called "neo-advaitic"
garbage should be tossed overboard as soon as possible by anyone
interested in actual advaita.
