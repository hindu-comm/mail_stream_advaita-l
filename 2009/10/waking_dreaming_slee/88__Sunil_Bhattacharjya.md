It is pathetic to see the scholars using the terms Neo-advaitic to show a difference. It is okay if a shallow person uses it. There is no difference between the teachings of Ramakrisna Paramhansa and that of Adi Sankaracharya. Ramakrishna's Advaita is no different from that of Adi Sankaracharya's. Even in the "Sree Vidya" upasana Ramakrishna worshipped the Mahamaya as Kali and Adi Sankaracharya did that as Tripurasundari (or Lalita or Kamakshi). There is no diference.

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Quote: "If people want to imagine that they have essentially the same brain
matter as Einstein and hence they should be as good in Physics - well
it's up to them."

Are you saying all are not Aathman?

If so you can surely show me to the garbage can! It will make no difference
to me.

Surely where at all is the difference?
