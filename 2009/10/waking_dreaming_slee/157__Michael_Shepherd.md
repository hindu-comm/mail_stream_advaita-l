Hmm... I'm thinking no if you mean anything for Atman to actively aid! But
possibly you didn't mean it that way either. Atman being the substratum,
remains the unchanged substratum. In the purest form, mind or chitta, may
claim a happiest state and fructify imagination too, thereby not remaining
so pure, being dragged away into thoughts and forming a world of thoughts.
