Quote: "...I'm not saying this to set off another round of belabouring these
foreign sudras...:

Why claim the sudhrahood?  Does this not betray a false stance of being a
'victim'?

The secularists with their claim of 'equality' were the ones who belabour
the Hindus with their inimical idea of  'discrimination' and putting down
the sudhras.  Such self-depiction of oneself as sudhra reveals the
secularist disapproval of our varnasrama dharma which is one of the
fundamentals of Hinduism.

I have in my musings, held that the varnas are universal and on that basis
would have conceded non-practicing brahminhood (a brahmin not following his
varna dharma).  But clearly there seems better advantage in claiming
different dehaathma buddhi of being a foreign sudhra!
