It is actually the other way around. Turiya is "further away" than
many of us like to pretend!

As Swami Vivekananda observed "99% of those who think they are saatvik
are steeped in the deepest of tamas". Thus we have people picking up
books and declaring themselves sampradayavits. Turiya is indeed
"close" for the pure-minded - those who have the four-fold
requirements and who have humbly approached an actual guru. And that
is not as easy or as common as people may like it to be.
