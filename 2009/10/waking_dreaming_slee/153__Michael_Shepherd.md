Praveenji,

Thank you. I know that 'sleep cycles' are calculated to last 90-120 minutes,
which may be significant; as dreaming occurs then.

Also it's said that the mind returns to atman between each thought and each
desire.

Some sages say that the prolongation of these periods is a huge help to
sadhana, because it allows the full consciousness to act freely in speech
and action, and thus act with more power; without being absorbed in useless
thought leading to useless actions !

Michael

Sidelining the "extension"; no offence meant by sidelining, or taken by your
extending poetry envisioning to itihAsa. :) I've not been able to find the
article from Vedanta Kesari I mentioned earlier on. But for what its worth,
I remember the author saying that brain moves from one avasthAtraya state/
wavelength-range to the other every n minutes. Of course, I forget what n
was now, but he had concluded that even during the day, when the brain gets
into dream state, a person may be seen to stare long into the distance,
albeit unknowingly, while not really being into what is happening in the
present!

Ta,
