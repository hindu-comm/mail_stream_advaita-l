Quote: " And that is not as easy or as common as people may like it to be."

Thinking it is difficult is the greatest impediment.  Guru is indeed needed
but the Guru is no substitute for the person who should first have the
craving.  How can one crave if the intellect raises obstacles?

The indication of the craving lies in the denying of the non-self (that he
assumes to be!).

Ramesh Krishnamurthyji rightly observed that the 'Turia' is nothing but the
Aathman.  The three states of being (jaagrat etc.) are products of the Guna
and the Thuria is beyond guna's grasp.

Hence the guna only affects or determines a person's karma and bhogam but
cannot stop him from attaining self-realization.  Self-realization is an
inherent right of a person irrespective of what guna he possesses.  So a
thaamasic person can be a realized soul.  Have you not read in the
Mahabharatha that a Brahmana approached a meat-chopper for self-realization
and our own Aadhi Sankara was taught AathmabhOtham by a chandala?

This is where the 'humbleness' comes!
