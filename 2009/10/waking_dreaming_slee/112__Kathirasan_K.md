Namaste Sunilji,

Thanks for the reply and further questions. What's more important than your
questions are the following questions:

1. Is the Advaita Vedanta tradition deficient in sadhanas such that we have
to borrow Bandhas and Asanas from the Natha Sampradaya to attain 'mental
tranquility'? If yes, does it not mean that the vedanta tradition is
deficient. If No, shouldn't shishtas lead by example to show 'murkhas' or
'modern minds' like me the path that has been laid by Bhagavadpada Shankara
and his disciples to be a complete self-sufficient soteriological system
relevant to all regardless of time.

2. If Yoga Taravali is a text by Adi Shankara, then the author of
Aparokshanubhuti cannot be the same person. Or vice versa. Anyone who has
read both texts would definitely be confused if the texts came from the same
pen.

I am not asking these questions to question the existing tradition but for
the sake of many seekers who have found such teachings very confusing. For
any mumukshu who values shrotriyatvam the study of scriptures, as svadhyaya
or with a teacher, is essential. When faced with such information, one's
shraddha in the tradition may be shaken. I have met such people in my life.
So pls forgive me if my intentions appear controversial or if it had hurt
your feelings.

In any case, I am not here to fight for a cause or to establish my view.
Personally as a Jijnasu I find the practices of Hatha Yoga helpful in Kaya
siddhi and citta shuddhi to a certain extent. However, I fully understand
that the knowledge of the Upanishads handled by a shrotriya brahmanishta
alone will bring you to the goal of jivanmukti. And also that Vedanta needs
no support from other sampradayas to improve it further. It is a complete
soteriological system that does not need the value addition of other
darshanas nor sampradayas. The prasthana trayi is complete.

This is my last post on this thread because it is not my aim to establish
'my' view. It is for the like-minded seekers to think if they want to and
for the rest to press the delete button upon reaching the end of this post.
:) Again thanks for reading and apologies if it hurt.
