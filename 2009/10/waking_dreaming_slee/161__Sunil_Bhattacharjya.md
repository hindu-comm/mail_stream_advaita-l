Namaste Shyamji,

It is said that if one sleeps in the day time and sees a dream that dream is of no consequence. How do you account for this?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

You mentioned:
"> It is a totally different view- it is a shift from the world-based view to astate-based subject-centric view where it is as though the states are thrust upon theperson in succession, and the states are the window toreality..... Problems of the waking state cannot be solved in the dream state orvice versa.So this vedantic view is against the general (and perhaps the scientific) view that dreams can beexplained or reasonedfrom the waking experiences, etc. Regards,
Savithri
*************
The scientific view is that "dreams arise because due to or represent mental impressions (vâsanâ) received in the waking state" - this is verbatim what Shankara also states in his sutrabhasya (3.2.6) 

Also in 3.2.4 Shankara states thus in reply to the interlocutor "Well then, as dreams are mere illusion, they do not contain a particle of reality?" --> Siddhanta: "Not so, we reply; for dreams are prophetic of future good and bad fortune. For scripture teaches as follows, 'When a man engaged in some work undertaken for a special wish sees in his dreams a woman, he may infer success from that dream-vision.' Other scriptural passages declare that certain dreams indicate speedy death, so, e.g. 'If he sees a black man with black teeth, that man will kill him.'-

If the states not be in succession - then any ideas of prophecy,etc ascribed to the dream will be in null and void - only a dream of "yesterday night" can predict the wake happenings of "tomorrow" - all in a continuum related exclusively to the waketime.

I am clarifying thus based on what you wrote - my apologies if I misunderstood your position.
