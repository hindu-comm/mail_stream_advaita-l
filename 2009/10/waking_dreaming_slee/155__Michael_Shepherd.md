Praveenji,

Exactly ! So it could be said that atman in the undisturbed state of deep
sleep, and atman as the indifferent observer of the waking state at its
clearest, aid the 'thinking mind' in its vichara, as mutually supportive..
the happiest state for imaginative writing, the arts etc.  Thanks.

Michael

If you meant all three by sleep cycles (waking, dream and deep sleep), then
yes, it was something like that in the artlcle. However, I remember it to be
much
lesser steps of minutes before the state changes in a cycle. And this
happens even during the day as the author claimed.

Well, its not so much so that the mind returns to Atman, but mind being a
bunch of thoughts, what exists between thoughts for whatever small fraction
of time is the Atman without the add-ons. At least thats how Tripura Rahasya
brings it out.
