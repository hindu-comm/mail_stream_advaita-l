Praveen ji,

Thank you. There are several arguments that could be adduced for the
simultaneity of the three -- or rather four -- states, I suggest :
They are present together in our ordinary memory;
They are present together in the present moment, which is the only
experience;
They are present together in turiya, which is our eternal gift;
They are present together in siksha, the eternal witness of the self.

So surely they are mutually supportive in our sadhana !

The pandits may correct me on this, but taijasa as the dreaming self
composed of light is so close a word to tejasa as the fire of celestial
splendour... imagination at all its levels. Sanskrit and Hinduism is badly
served by translation into English with its familiar associations !

Hari Om, Michael-ji,

I'm not sure if your 'dreams' are realized in this reply of mine, but
I'm just trying to return to your original question. :)

The question reminds me of when four of us from this list visited
Swami Paramananda Bharati associated with Sringeri Math at Bangalore.
Among our questions he did answer something pertaining to avasthA
trayA. He said that all the three states are 'actually existing
simultaneously'. Now, as a background, let me add that Swamiji was a
scientist in his purvAshrama.

There was another scientist who took to sannyAsa in Ramakrishna order,
whose name I forget. But some months or maybe years after the above
darshana, I came across an article online written by this Ramakrishna
ashram swamiji about avasthA trayA, as published in Vedanta Kesari. It
was full of details of how the avasthA changes from one state to the
other, at what intervals, what are the wavelengths and other
relations. I remember skimming through the same but lost the bookmark.
I'll try to hunt the same online and post it if I do find it. Maybe he
wrote something that will help realize your 'dreams'. :)

brahmArpaNamastu,
--Praveen R. Bhat

we can see a mutual support -- each day -- between these states which if
recognised, may aid our sadhana.
