Dear Kathirajanji,

While Vidyasankarji will reply to you I would suggest that you may have a look at the Yogataravali if not done so earlier.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Namaste Vidyashankarji,

My earlier comment was made having studied, practiced and taught some the
teachings of Hatha Yoga Pradipika, and also other Hatha Yoga shastras
(gheranda samhita, shiva samhita, hatharatnavali etc). From the standpoint
that you come from, obviously any practice can be fused into Advaita
Vedanta, even if it may be islamic or christian. To me this is the plight of
modern vedanta where you don't find an uncompromising Shankara anymore.

But I am in complete agreement that Shankara had no issues with Yoga Sadhana
but it is obvious that he had issues with Yoga Darshana as a soteriological
system compiled/taught by Patanjali.

I would be very interested to know if Jalandhara, Uddiyana & mula bandhas
were taught by shankara in his Bhasyas as a valid means to advaita atma
darshana or citta shuddhi. Or was it that the acarya realised that the
prasthana traya lacked teachings/practices to bring about mental
tranquility?
