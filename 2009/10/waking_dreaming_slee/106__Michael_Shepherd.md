That's very interesting. But the key advaitic question remains -- does this
samadhi/turiya, yoga/Vedanta amalgam work in practice ?

These discussion seem to have wandered into areas far from the practical
question question I posed !  (All the more personally urgent this morning as
my body bears the tensions of a particularly vivid nightmare of a habitual
'struggle' pattern -- and that after an evening of fine satsanga !)
