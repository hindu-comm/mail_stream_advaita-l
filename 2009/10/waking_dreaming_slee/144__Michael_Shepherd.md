Vishiji,

These days it's best to ask questions of Sadananda on his own website --
which includes many answers to questions previously put.

Prana comes from the dhatu pra, 'forth' and an, 'breathe', so is taken as
the divine vitality that permeates the jiva. It is seen to move in five
different ways within the body.

It may be  connected to the term 'atman'  but scholars seem uncertain about
this.

There has been a lot of scholarly comment on Adi Shankara's use of avidya,
namarupa, maya, and Ishwara, and the way he sometimes uses one where you'd
expect another... but the general view seems to be that he uses ishwara and
the other terms to signify all that refers to the workings of prakriti as
they ultimately affect the jiva i.e. anything l;ess than Brahman or Om.
That raises the question of whether this corresponds to the sense in the
Veda that Ishwara is a god like others named. The general view seems to be
that it's not a useful question ! i.e. if you're reading the Veda, Ishwara
is what it says he is; if you're reading Shankara, then only Brahman is the
real concern !

I didn't post on rebirth, because for me, it is the most perfect and
practical viewpoint -- but unproveable to most of us.. better taken as an
article of faith than argued over ! I think to understand it properly one
would have to understand the illusion of time itself ! (Which isn't so
difficult : when one falls completely still and atman rules, where is
rebirth ?!)

Please excuse my ironic humour.. sometimes the divine play carries me away !
But do ask Sadanandaji about rebirth..

Michael

Daer Michealji

I too am here in this website in search of truth and thast why the question
was asked!!!

I can understand your hesitation to answer, buy why not other learned
members like Anbuji/ sunilji??

I am sure Sadanandaji should be busy in something else otherwise he might
have clarified
my doubts on rebirth.

Dear Vishyji,

I'm on this website list for the sake of truth -- so I don't want to say
something which gets attacked as the misinterpretations of some covert
Christian missionary,,,:)

In my understanding (pause for laughter) bhakta as the way of devotion
allows for a delightful play, as the gopis with Krishna, between oneself and
the 'Lord'. This has given rise to a literature which talks -- expecially in
Sufism and other mystical traditions -- of the Lord setting 'tests' to tease
us into greater love...

The jnani tradition would simply see this as karma and reward -- almost or
entirely mechanical in its operation.

I myself don't have any problem -- as Shankara in his delightful prayer to
Giriga for instance, if indeed it is his -- with being aware of both
traditions simultaneously as part of chitshakti lila...

However, I'm not saying this to set off another round of belabouring these
foreign sudras...:)

Michael

Srinivas ji,

Thanks for that. I'm trying to find whether 'dream' or taijasa can be
redefined legitimately as 'mental actiivity' and thus incorporate not only
nightly 'dreaming' and envisioning, but also the envisioning of poets and
writers -- and by extension, the very Veda and Upanishads and Mahabharata
etc, as created 'visions of truth'.

And that, without offending the pandits...!

Michael

Namaste,

Here is my understanding in brief:

Sleep is the base state. This is the state of akSara puruSa.
>From sleep ones "wakes" up into either "dream" state or "awake"
state. Both these constitute the state of kSara puruSa.

As you have rightly pointed out "dream" state plays an
important part in sAdhanA.
Outward description of of any upAsanA highlights the inter-play
between"dream" and "awake" state.

You might want to inquire if "sleep" state has a role in sAdhanA.
(mahA viSNu sleeping on a snake may be some indirect reference
on this front.)
And then what about fourth state.

I am not aware of any scripture which talks openly and explicitly on
these issues.

Other than mANDukya other text that treats this topic somewhat
more deeply is the last chapter of chandogya (prajApati's intruction to
indra). Some material can also be found in yAjnavalkya discourse to
janaka in bRhadAraNyaka (4th chapter - I think).

Regards,
Shrinivas
