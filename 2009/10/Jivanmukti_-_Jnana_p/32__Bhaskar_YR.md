Shankara actually clarifies that the term Brahmanas in this context can be 
taken to refer to Kshatriyas and Vaishyas in addition to Brahmanas. So 
this objection is unfounded. In any case the topic under discussion in the 
Brahmasutras is adhikartvam for jnanaprapti and NOT the need for 
sarvakarmasannyasa after attainment of jnana.

Kindly give the sUtra reference for the above commentary...let me also 
have a look at it.
