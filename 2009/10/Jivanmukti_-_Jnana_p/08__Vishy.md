Dear Shyamji

here, what do you mean by 'Sanyasa' ? Hope you too agree its certainly not just taking diksha from some guru and retiring in to some place away from all wearing kavi
At whatever age wherever one live , if one can live without any sort of attachemnt /desire to anything or anyone, despite living in market place one can be in sanyas

Dear Sivam-ji
Pranams.

You write:
My humble interlude with Shyamji was to bring to his attention that
self-inquiry is not to be deferred to any particular ashrama.

My response:

Please note that I am not saying one must postpone vichara for jnanaprapti until one takes sannyasa - although this is by all means the ideal situation - not the "postponement" part but the "taking sannyasa part" :)

My aim (as the title of my series indicates) is to show that the traditional position is this - without sannyasa, even if one acquires samyag Jnana, it does not confer the fruit of jivanMukti.
