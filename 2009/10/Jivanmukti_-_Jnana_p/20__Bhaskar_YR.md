what difference does it make to a Jnani if such were to happen, and why 
should he strive to co-operate if his mind is singlepointedly focussed on 
the Atman - the Lord Himself will ensure his sustenance "- atah Bhagwaan 
EVA teshaam yogakshemam vahatiti"

This is exactly my point prabhuji...why one should bother & obligate 
himself  to 'become' a saNyAsi when his mind abadoning all desires and 
focussing singlepointedly on Atman??  bhagavAn himself would take care of 
everything is it not??  The jnAni does not have to put any effort of his 
own to shift his place from gruhasthAshrama to saNyAsAshrama 'to sustain' 
his accrued jnAna & get that so called mukti :-)) ...For him changing 
gears sorry, changing ashrams hardly matters as he sees action in inaction 
and inaction in action in that socalled day to day transactions.  He 
mentally renounces everything and there would be nothing in his possession 
to make the 'modifications' to the status & scenario.  He transcends the 
very katrutva bhAva itself and his mind absolutely unattached to 
everything even he is outwardly doing all sorts of karma.  sarvakarmANi
