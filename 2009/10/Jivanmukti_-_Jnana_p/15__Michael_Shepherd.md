Dear Vishyji

I agree with you -- vanaprastha, like the other ashrama, is a task complete
to itself : clearing the mind and attending to samashti. No need to buy a
begging bowl until vanaprastha is fulfilled !

My other comment referred to what might be the 'background of the mind' in
another yuga, where human beings would seem nearer to the rule of Brahman,
and so matters like 'human sacrifice' would be seen differently..
I have in mind the Inuit people who survive by fishing. They have such
respect for the continuuum of life, the merging of all forms of life, that
the fish is seen as the spiritually superior in a sense, laying down its
life for the human, who kills it with great respect, knowing that in his
last or next life, he may be fish... That gives me a sense of what life in a
different yuga might be to the mind. However, I don't want to make too much
of this. I don't think discussion of ritual killing 'in former times' is
goint anywhere !

Pranams,

Michael

Dear Shyamji/Michealji

All the yugas are same as far as minds (which is the seat of ego)of people
are concerned.
According to me starting to see the mind as seperate entity and witnessing
its activities
is the vanaprastha state and keeping the mind totally aside is what sanyas
is all about

ofcourse, the means to achieve this vary from time/place/people a bit
according to the circumstances.

Regardless what is said anywhere else, a person who has set aside the mind
or have total
control over is, infact, the real sanyasi/ jeevan muktha .... Best example
for this is
king Janaka and Shri Krishna himself.

Namaste,

I'd like to think that in previous yugas, everyone kept food ready and an
eye out for the darshan, the blessing of the opportunity to give to a
sannyasin ? maybe there are still people like that ?

Namaste,

Does it mean that "Jivet sharadam shatam" does not apply to a Sannyashi?
Begging for alms is the biggest ego-buster and it is also the sure sign of
leaving the family and the social ties behind. But do the present-day
saannyashis really do the begging from house to house for their meal ( which
has to be only a single meal per day and limited to whatever they can get
through begging) or does it come to them effortlessly through the
organisation they belong to?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Pranams
Please read through my series(Pt 1 to 6) where I have explained at lenght
what sannyasa is. It is a

1. Renunciation in toto of all efforts including those considered critical
for ensuring the continued life of the body,
2. Living on the absolute minimal of food and that too obtained by chance
and typically as alms,
3. Being completely bereft of ANY possessions whatsoever
4. Having no ties or relationships with anyone else in the world - i.e.
living in solitude
5. Having a mind/intellect singlepointedly and all-cunsumingly devoted
exclusively to the Lord.

Trust this clarifies.
