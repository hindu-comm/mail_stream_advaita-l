Namaste,

Does it mean that "Jivet sharadam shatam" does not apply to a Sannyashi? Begging for alms is the biggest ego-buster and it is also the sure sign of leaving the family and the social ties behind. But do the present-day saannyashis really do the begging from house to house for their meal ( which has to be only a single meal per day and limited to whatever they can get through begging) or does it come to them effortlessly through the organisation they belong to?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Pranams
Please read through my series(Pt 1 to 6) where I have explained at lenght what sannyasa is. It is a 

1. Renunciation in toto of all efforts including those considered critical for ensuring the continued life of the body,
2. Living on the absolute minimal of food and that too obtained by chance and typically as alms, 
3. Being completely bereft of ANY possessions whatsoever
4. Having no ties or relationships with anyone else in the world - i.e. living in solitude
5. Having a mind/intellect singlepointedly and all-cunsumingly devoted exclusively to the Lord.

Trust this clarifies.
