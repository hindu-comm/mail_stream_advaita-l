You had mentioned in your earlier posting, "Quite funny observation.  So according to you Janaka, who was a chakravorthy  was not a jeevan mukta".

Would you then say that when Sankara himself permits the possibility of Janaka not being a Jivanmukta in his commentary to Gita 3.20, he must have been joking?

Sureshvara in his Sambandha Vartika 221:

  satyAnR^ite sukhaduHkhe iti tathA sarvasaMnyAsapUrvakam.h .
  AtmAno.anveshhaNaM sAkshAt ApastaMbaH abravIn muniH .. 221 ..

  "'Truth and untruth, pleasure and pain' etc. ought to be
  completely renounced prior to the quest for the Self, as
  the sage Apastamba himself has so declared."

The verse that Sureshvara quotes is from the Apastamba Dharma Sutra, which is undoubtedly concerning Sannyasa Ashrama. Sureshvara says that Sannyasa is to be taken BEFORE an enquiry into the Self.

What then to say concerning steadiness in GYAna which almost certainly requires Sannyasa?
