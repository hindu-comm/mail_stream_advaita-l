Bhaskarji,

Sri gurubyO namaha

May i remind the word of the Lord that there are four paths to attain Mukthi
-  Karma, Bhakthi, Yoga and Gnana?

All these four paths prepare the buddhi to receive its fatal dose from the
Guru.  Are you wondering what this fatal dose is for the buddhi?  It is 'Tat
Tvam Asi'!

'Tat Tvam Asi' is the final Gnana that transports a person beyond the
prakrthi.

'Tat Tvam Asi' is the Veda Vaakya'.
