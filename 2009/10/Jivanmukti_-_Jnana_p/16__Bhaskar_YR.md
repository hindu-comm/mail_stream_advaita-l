I am afraid, these descriptions are good & worth  enough to read ONLY on 
paper...Nobody (both bygone Acharya-s & presently living saNyAsi-s in any 
of the trimatastha saMpradAya) would satisfy above conditions. 

Condition No.1 reminds me 'sallekhana vrata' of jaina monks...I request 
Sri shyam prabhuji to be more specific when he says :'efforts those 
considered critical for sustaining the life of the body'...I donot know 
whether these critical efforts include breathing and taking food also. And 
how many Acharya-s we see wearing only a strip of cloth??  this includes 
my parama guruji also.  SanyAsi-s normally wear loin cloth as an inner 
garment & on above they wear 2 mtrs. kAshAya vastra. 

Condition No. 2 :  How many present day Acharya-s fulfilling this 
condition??  'food obtained by chance that too as alms'...I dont know how 
many present day Acharya-s following this in toto...No offence is meant 
here...Even my parama guruji Sri SSS also was not doing bhikshAtana but I 
heard that people used to say : this is the time for bhikshA to 
swamiji...But food was supplied to his place...I think this is what is 
happening today in traditional advaitik mutts also with a mouth watering 
menu :-)) .  And I myself seen a saNyAsi Sri jnAnaprasUnendra   Saraswati 
in Mattur, Karnataka, he used to come from his hermitage to Sri Keshava 
AvadhAni ( a gruhastha priest)'s house for bhiksha one time in a day... 

Condition No. 3 :  I am not able to comment on this...shankara's sarvajna 
peeTArOhaNa comes to my mind immediately :-))

Condition No. 4 :  Sri RamaNa bhagavAn used to love cow lakshmi and also 
insisted a place to bury her after death...shankara bhagavatpAda promised 
her mother that he will be there before her death..my parama guruji, as I 
heard, used to move with his relations & his pUrvAshrama mates very 
frequently..I dont think these are all possible unless there is a 'special 
relationship'...Or otherwise, from a vedAntic view : They do, but they 
donot :-)) 

Condition No. 5 :  then how shankara went to mandana mishra for 'vAda 
bhiksha' ??  why & how he wrote volumes of bhAshya citing pUrvapaxa, why 
he wanted to give suitable answer to house wife's question??  How can a 
single pointed mind could see somany contradictions & conflictions in 
vedAnta prapancha..

Having said all this, kindly dont think I am outrightly rejecting the 
possibility of existence of sanyAsi-s who fulfill all the above 
conditions...But if some one does this, he would certainly remain 
'anonymous'...not the noted & popular figures...Unfortunately saNyAsi-s 
who we know, heard, seen donot fulfill either one of the above conditions. 
 What we come to know from this??  The bAhyAcharaNa & external attitudes & 
activities hardly matters when one is PERFECT renunciate in mind. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
