A sanyaasi is not a Gnani but one desiring Gnana.

praNAms Sri Shiva prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Kindly see bruhadAraNyaka bhAshya (3-5-1).  Here shankara says the 
pArivrAjya is of the nature of transcending the desires (eshaNa-s), is 
ancillary to the knowledge of Atman, for it is of the nature of 
renunciation of the desire opposed to the knowledge of Atman...Apart from 
this shankara says there is another type of saNyAsa in the form of an 
Ashrama which is again a means to the attainment of bramalOka and other 
fruits of action.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
