English dictionaries should come with a Health Warning -- ' Beware ! Every
word in this dictionary carries a dangerous virus called IAmTheDoer :
disinfect with foaming Advaitavedanta  before using.' :)

"Effort" consists in remaining in action and is grounded in ignorance and
betrays inadequate acquisition of knowledge - "non-effort" entails
sarvakarmasannyasa so as to remain in uninterrupted contemplation and
assimilation of the acquired but as yet unsteady knowledge so as to gain
absorption unto it.

I hope the difference is clear - if not you can refer to posts 5 and 6 where
Shankara patiently explains in great depth.

Hari OM
