Shankara actually clarifies that the term Brahmanas in this context can be 
taken to refer to Kshatriyas and Vaishyas in addition to Brahmanas. So 
this objection is unfounded. In any case the topic under discussion in the 
Brahmasutras is adhikartvam for jnanaprapti and NOT the need for 
sarvakarmasannyasa after attainment of jnana.

Hare Krishna

Please note, I am talking about bruhadAraNyaka bhAshya where shankara 
explicitly says : na hi kshatriya vaishyayOH pArivrAjya 
pratipattirasti...If you need the maNtra reference I shall get you on 
Monday...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
