I am interested in advaita philosophy. i would like to get added to the 
mailing group.


Suresh Marur

I have been studying Vedanta through commentaries on texts like 
Vivekachudamani, Tattva Bodha and from books on Vedanta and Advaita by 
Swami Dayananda Saraswati and Swami Paramarthananda for nearly 6 years 
now.

Practices like Sandhyavandanam and Panchayatana puja along with studying 
Vedanta has acted in a positive feedback loop, each increasing the 
efficacy of the other over the years.

I was attracted to Advaita and Vedanta after studying books on Zen and 
Buddhism (authors like Alan Watts, Robert Pirsig, Osho etc.) and was able 
to appreciate the nuances of Advaita and its completeness.

I wish to learn from others' experiences in this group and am hoping to 
contribute to the discussions based on my abilities and understanding of 
Vedanta.
