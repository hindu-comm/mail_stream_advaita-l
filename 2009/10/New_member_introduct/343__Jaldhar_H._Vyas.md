Namaste,

  I, Ramesh Achanta, have been reading about advaita, sanatana dharma for 
quite sometime. Got into advaita while trying to understand where 
modern/quantum physics leading into during my post graduation. Wanted to 
know more by joing the group. I am software engineer by profession.

thanks
