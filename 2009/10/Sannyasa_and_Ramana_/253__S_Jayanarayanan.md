Ramana said that he belonged to ati-varNa-Ashramam: beyond all varNa and Ashrama.

“We are poor sannyasis, we survive on what others give us. We never had any money at all,” said Bhagavan.

The above is Bhagavan himself speaking, not the author's opinion.

That is indeed strange, because Sri Ramana Leela is almost universally acknowledged to be an accurate record of Ramana's life. For instance,

http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.com/2008/05/authenticity-of-bhagavans-writings-and.html

"Bhagavan replied that the authors of Self-Realization and Sri Ramana Vijayam had left shortly after completing their works, whereas Krishna Bhikshu had stayed and updated his book from time to time. I would take this to imply that Bhagavan thought that Ramana Leela was more accurate than the others because the author had taken the trouble to check the revisions with Bhagavan himself."
