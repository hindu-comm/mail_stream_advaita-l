*Dear Friends,*
*
*
*Sri Ramana Bhagavan was NOT a snnyaasi. *
*He never claimed to be one. He often used*
*expressions like 'we sadhus ...' etc. including himself and the others in
the Ashram. Never once did he say he was a sannyaasi.  He never never
claimed that he was a  sannyasi by deekhsa.  Nor did he give himself a name*
*like 'swami so and so', nor did he wear ocher robes,*
*nor did he initiate and 'give' ocher robes to any, he did not even motivate
anyone to take sannyaas. He opined that sannyasa was not indispensible for
self realization. *
*He repeated these words several  times.*
*
*
*On one occasion he was asked by a Govt official,*
*on record,  what 'ashrama' he belonged to  if not the sannyaasaahrama.  He
said, on record, that he belonged to the ateetaahrama. *
*
*
*Vashitaadi maharshis were grihasthas.*
*That a spiritually advance person ought to have been*
*an ochre robed sanyasin is an unfounded modern concept.*
*
*
As for the description in the Ramana Leela, the views were entirely the
author's. That it was written while Bhagavan was in the physical body does
not mean that
*every page whetted, verified or approved my him.*
*
*
*There are a few biographical works on him written by stalwarts in
Bhagavan's life time, that were read out to him and were scrupulously
corrected based on his comments. The Leela unfortunately was not one of
them.*
