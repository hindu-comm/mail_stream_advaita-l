Dear Vishyji,

Pranas and the Panchendriyas are referred to the devatas who occupy those
positions.

When someone has a dehaathma buddhi he sees the jagat as real and performs
karma in pursuit of happiness and in turn is governed by Easwara who
administers karmaphala.  Yes this is duality which hold that jeeva and
Brahman as different.  Dhukkam exists in dwaitha prapancham.  Dwaitha
vedanta of Ramanuja and Madhwas have their own concepts on the release of
jeeva from samsaara.  Advaita has its own.

Anbu
