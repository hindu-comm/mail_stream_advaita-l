Dear Vishyji,

An object is something that you can can recognize as an entity apart from
you.  Manas as we speak  of objectively is not an entity capable of being
pointed out as an object. So you cannot tell me  that such and such thing is
your manas that I can recognize.  Yet we all know that each one has a manas
that is purely private that cannot be fathomed by another however much the
modern psychoanalysis can claim that it can.   So much so the mind is not
defineable even though we keep trying!  It is not subject to the
phenomenology indicating birth, decay and death.  Yet it is born and dead on
a daily basis!  (More on that later.)  Thus manas is identical to the
subject!

Gnanis who have realized tell you that it, the manas, is not the subject but
an imposter, a non-entity.  But as long as you are not a Gnani you do not
know that!

Thus you cannot say all on a sudden: "I declare that I am not the manas and
from tomorrow onwards I am going to behave as if I do not have the manas."
Such is not in the realm of possibility.

You can identify yourself only with something that is different from you
such as your gross body.

Your gross body is an object lending to perception to you and others as an
object.  In dream time you have the subtle body that lends to perception as
an object to you as well as the others of your dream time.  And the causal
body in your deep sleep is unknown to you let alone others (who do not
exist) during deep sleep but you come to know of its existence as you
describe that this entity enjoyed bliss of a peaceful sleep.

Thus you can only identity yourself only with a body and we know that it has
three different forms viz. the sthoola sareeram, the sookshma sareeram and
the kaaraNa sareeram.

In waking time all the three sareerams are present but the sthoola sareeram
is dominant.

In dream time your gross body is lying there like a log but your sookshma
sareeram is active.  Thus in dream time you do not have the sthoola sareeram
but you do have the other two, namely the sookshma sareeram and the kaarana
sareeram.

In deep sleep state sookshma sareeram is also absent leaving only the
kaaraNa sareeram to be present.  Without the sookshma sareeram no perception
is possible and so the world of deep sleep is one of darkness and inactivity
(for all activity involve objects).  Only the SELF which is pure Aananda is
present but the kaaraNa sareeram cannot perceive it yet experiences the
Aananda!

This kaarana sareeram is actually the ego, the small 'i' which we call as
ahamkara.  No karma that includes perception or the objective knowledge can
take place without this ahamkara.

The entire universe as you see churning itself as a huge machine is due to a
mahat ahamkara which we call as Easwara.  The universe is thus his body.  He
is Jagannathan.  He protects his own body as Jagat Rakshakan.  He is the
macrocosm.

You and I identity with our respective bodies and have a unique name and
form to differentiate from others and protect it from all dangers and pine
on its decay and death.  Thus the identification we have is due to the
kaaraNa sareeram called the ahamkara. This is the microcosm.

 I have only dealt with part of your first sentence: "Can I say all exist as
long as you are identifying yourself with manas (mind) .."  I have touched
on two questions: (a) identification and (b) objective world and the manas.
My short answer is:

(a) YOU - as you speak of in relation to the world - is a body, a smaller
body in relation to a bigger variegated body called jagat; and

(b) the 'all' that you speak of is the world at large and it is what the
mind presents to you (nothing more!)  You know that in deep sleep the world
(consisting of the macrocosm and the microcosm) does not exist because the
mind is absent.

 I wish to continue this in many postings as the questions you have raised
are quite vast. In the meantime ask me questions if you have on what I have
written so far.
