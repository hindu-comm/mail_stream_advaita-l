Having said that, there are instances even in Shankaraâ€™s bhashyas where he 
clearly differentiates jnana and mukti. 



praNAms Sri Shyam prabhuji
Hare Krishna

This goes quite against to the shankara bhAshya.  Shankara reinforces his 
argument at various places without any ambiguity that final release 
(mukti) is only the dispersal of ignorance and no more!! Take the tattu 
samanvayAt sUtra bhAshya for example : Shruti-s point out that mOksha 
accrues immediately after the dawn of the knowledge of brahman, and thus 
precludes the necessity for anything else to be done in the interval 
before release.  brahmavit brahmaiva bhavati...and in continution shankara 
quotes br.up. 1-4-10 mantra and says this shruti maNtra wards off the idea 
of something to be done in the interval between realization of brahman and 
becoming all this universe.  This passage is analogous to the statement 
'he sings standing' where it is conclusive that there is no action 
intervening between the acts of standing and singing....

So, according to shankara there is no interval between jnAna & mukti & 
this mukti is nothing but just removal of ignorance & NOTHING ELSE!! Then, 
what exactly is jnAna daurbalyaM??  shankara himself clarifies in 
subsequent br. up. bhAshya.

BTW, what exactly is this mukti you are talking about APART FROM 
samyakjnAna??  is this a special 'experience' in sanyAsa Ashrama?? kindly 
clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
