Among the alternatives you mention, the last is close to what is meant. Bearing in mind

that we are talking about times which were very different from today's state of affairs,

the brAhmaNa's life, for example, has sharply demarcated stages. Each stage has

its own set of duties and rules of conduct. He goes away to serve the Guru and 

receive a Vedic education for a number of years, returns home to get married and lead a

householder's life, etc. The absence of such demarcated stages in the life of the shUdra is

perhaps what is meant.
