Dear Sunil,

The explanation offered by historians (and of course based on Darwinism like
so much history) is that a simple agrarian society (as still to be witnessed
today) with 'farmers' markets' --and before that, no money, only barter --
required no merchant class at first.

In fact, I believe that in some places today, entrepreneurs are pushing
peasant farmers into poverty by taking over the markets and extracting
profit for themselves with no 'vaishya' benefit to society, only damage.

The same historians aver that varna as such is a 'late social
development' -- however spiritually true.

Michael

Dear Vidyasankarji,

We know that there are four Varnas and Lord Krishna also showed how the
different Varnas have thir separate occupations. Yet the Atharva veda
appears to equate the Shudras with Vaishya, as Vish, the third Varna(AV
3.12)? Vajasneyi is not far behind in this (YV 18.48). Any comment?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
