Ananya Pareek

Hello all,

I am Ananya from Pune. I got into this philosophy a few months back and it
seems to me to be the best one till now. I want to explore more of it, so
joined it. I hope I get a good exposure from other experienced persons here.

Thanks

Anubhav Tewari

Hari Om! This is Anubhav Tewari from Chandigarh. I want to know and understand
Advaita Vedanta philosophy. I have been associated with Chinmaya Mission (a
spiritual organization) for some time now and have basic understanding of the
subject. Would want to enhance my understanding, practise and evolve.
