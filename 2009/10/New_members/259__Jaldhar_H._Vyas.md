Certainly.  However I have noticed in a wide range of Internet forums that 
no matter what the subject, most readers will not participate.  so 
advaita-l is not unusual in that way.

But let me reiterate what you said.  All are welcome to comment on any 
current topic or to start a new thread on any topic related to Advaita 
Vedanta and Smarta sampradaya.
