Jaldharji,

Would it be impertinent of me to say, how welcome all newcomers are to this
site; but, having joined, should they not be putting their most heartfelt
questions to the sages here, rather than sit in the audience while we debate
the finer points...?

In my experience, questions from the heart carry a divine energy with
them -- they can call out more truth from those who answer them than those
sages 'know that they know'...

Apologies if I speak out of turn..

Michael

Hello all,

I am Ananya from Pune. I got into this philosophy a few months back and it
seems to me to be the best one till now. I want to explore more of it, so
joined it. I hope I get a good exposure from other experienced persons here.

Thanks

Hari Om! This is Anubhav Tewari from Chandigarh. I want to know and
understand
Advaita Vedanta philosophy. I have been associated with Chinmaya Mission (a
spiritual organization) for some time now and have basic understanding of
the
subject. Would want to enhance my understanding, practise and evolve.
