I'm sorry that you think I have misconstrued the 'meaning' of maya. Maya is
quite clear from its actions ! And that is a grace in itself.
All the rest is a problem of words. If we attribute it to the 'veiling and
revealing' powers of the Lord, then it becomes part of chitshakti lila --
rather than some bogey as it is sometimes represented. It is so easily
misrepresented, and can scare people off seeing the beauty of the Lord's
creation (as indeed it was once to me -- that's why  I feel so strongly on
the matter !).

I hope we are not in fundamental disagreement !

Pranams,
Michael

Sri.Michel Shepherd
I am sorry that you have misconstued the meaning of "Maya".Maya means that
which is not,Ya ma sa maya.For 'Maya'to have its power,it is necessary
that the Jiva must have avidya.That avidya is abourt Brahman.Then what is
Maya?Is it a power associated with Brahman or separate from it.If it is
associated with Brahman,then how is it it is sublated for the
Jivanmukta?If it is not associated with Brahman,then it has reality.In
order to place this type of indeterminacy,Maya has been conferred the
status of "anirvacaniya khyati".The sadasadvilakshnatva of Maya has it
power of avarana and viksepa.
                                                          N.Srikanta.
