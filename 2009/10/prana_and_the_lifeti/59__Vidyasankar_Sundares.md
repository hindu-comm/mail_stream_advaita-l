Dear Michael,



Any such textual reference about what prANa is directed towards at

different ages needs to be taken, not as a statement of principle, but

as what is called arthavAda. The aim of such a statement would be to

exhort people to turn their attention to inner development at least at

a late age in their lives.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
