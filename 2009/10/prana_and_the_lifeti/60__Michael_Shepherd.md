Dear Vidyashankar,

Thank you for a prompt reply !

As advice, I wouldn't challenge it. But I wondered if there were any grounds
for the precision about age. Otherwise, I would think that the teachings on
kosha and varnashrama are more applicable in practice than a statement like
this.

The curse of short-term memory in advancing age certainly favours spiritual
work more than mental work, I find !

Michael

Dear Michael,



Any such textual reference about what prANa is directed towards at

different ages needs to be taken, not as a statement of principle, but

as what is called arthavAda. The aim of such a statement would be to

exhort people to turn their attention to inner development at least at

a late age in their lives.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
