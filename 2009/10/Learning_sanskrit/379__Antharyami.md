Hari OM~Shri Magesh ji,

For Sanskrit self-study, you may find the following books useful,

1. Devavani pravesika, 3rd Ed, by Robert. P. Goldman, University of
California.

2, Sanskrit - complete course book, Michael Coulsan, Hodder & Stoughton,
London.

Both these books are standard ones. But of course I always recommend learn
the language under proper guidance. Good luck.

With Narayana Smrti,
