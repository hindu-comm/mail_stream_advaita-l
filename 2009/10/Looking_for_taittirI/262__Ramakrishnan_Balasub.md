I looked at the (TITUS
http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil.htm#Samh) -
the download is restricted.

But I did manage to find the kANDAnukramaNikA by myself - it was in
the last few pages of A. Mahadeva Sastri's edition of Bhatta Bhaskaras
commentary. But I am wondering if there is any commentary to this
which is available.
