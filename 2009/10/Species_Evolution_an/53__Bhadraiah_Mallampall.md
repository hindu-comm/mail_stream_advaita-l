Dear Michael,



>From advaita standpoint knowledge (or experience) of non-duality is everything. 



A short beaked bird, if a knower of advaita, might as well tap that aspect of creator within, and take a wide range of actions which prompt evolution/creation of plants that suit its beak or prolong its own beak. In short it will exploit its own faculties that produce its own food, which in external world means what you see and interpret. 



Regards

Bhadraiah
