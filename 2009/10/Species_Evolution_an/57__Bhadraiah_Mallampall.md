>From advaita knowledge (or experience) standpoint non-duality is everything. 



A short beaked bird, if a knower of advaita, might as well tap that aspect of creator within, and take a wide range of actions which prompt evolution/creation of plants that suit its beak or worst case lengthen its own beak. In short it will exploit its own faculties to maintain continuance of its own food.
