Oh yes, I forgot to mention that the bird itself had read the 'Conference of
the birds' and so knew all the answers... :)

>From advaita standpoint knowledge (or experience) of non-duality is
everything.

A short beaked bird, if a knower of advaita, might as well tap that aspect
of creator within, and take a wide range of actions which prompt
evolution/creation of plants that suit its beak or prolong its own beak. In
short it will exploit its own faculties that produce its own food, which in
external world means what you see and interpret.
