If my belief is correct, there are a number of Sanyasi inmates in all the
three Vedantic Matas not merely in Sringeri Mutt  and they all got initiated
by senior inmates at the beck of the Pujya Aachaaryaas.  Invariably all the
inmates in these Mathas in their poorvasramas were Brahmins.  I never heard
of one single exception.

Practice speaks volumes of the mind of the Matadhipathis.  And again if
there were exceptions they would only prove the opposite.
