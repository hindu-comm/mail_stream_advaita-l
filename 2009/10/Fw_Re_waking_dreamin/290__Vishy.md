Dear Michaelji,

Lord testing people seems weird to me also. I appreciate why Sankhya is Godless though it does not declare God to be non-existent. God does not test people but one who has controlled one's ego by submitting to the Lord is rewarded for controlling one's ego and that is how a bhakta gets benefit. Everything is karma and reward. Niskama karma too has the reward of Brahmajnana.

Regards,

Sunil

Anbu, I bow to your judgment.

You know more about the Lord than the Lord does.

Is this your prayer or a bypassing of the theory of karma and
reincarnation?

Sorry, revisionism and liberalism are no escape routes in our understanding
of the Veda nor are we indulging in the exegesis of the bible.
