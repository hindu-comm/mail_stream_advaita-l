Quote: "Turning the mind inwards does not come easy, which is why we have
all the different karmas and
upAsanas."

This is again a statement coming out of affliction from secular ideas of
equality of all men.  Our fold fold varna dharma separates the people on the
basis of their guNa visesham.  Any appeal to the mind is made to the
Brahmanas only for they are the ones destined to leave dehaabimaanam that
starts with the abandonment of karma.  To other varnas such advice to leave
dehaabimaanam is forbidden.  The other three varnas are needed for the
stability, security and well-being of the society by their karmas.

Bhagavan Ramana actually discouraged people from taking to Sanyasa for he
was not in favour of upsetting the dependents of the aspirants.  He advised
them to do what is expected of Sanyasis namely the search for Truth without
relinquishing the present Aashrama.  Such seekers for Sanyasa Aashrama were
invariably from the Brahmin community.  To others (of non-Brahmin varnas)
Bhagavan advised karma and bhakthi maargas.  Women invariably received
manthrOpadesa to quieten their mind.  It is false to say Bhagavan only
taught gnaana maarga.

The famous treatise 'naan yaar' came out of him at the bidding of a
non-Brahmin man.  In spite of this this gentleman came to Bhagavan later and
asked him if he should remarry.  Clearly dehaabimaanam and the consequent
guna-karma vibhaagam was at play.

This great treatise on naan yaar is worth listening to.  It is in Tamil.
Non-Tamil people please excuse.  The English version is also available to
read on the net.
