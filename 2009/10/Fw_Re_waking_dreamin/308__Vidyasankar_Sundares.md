Let me ask you, what are we talking about here? Whether a non-brAhmaNa

can become a saMnyAsin or whether a non-brAhmaNa saMnyAsin may have

the same level of textual learning as a traditionally schooled brAhmaNa

saMnyAsin? Why mix up these issues?



My comments were reserved for the first question alone. The latter is

something on which there can be no general rule.
