If you are looking for scholarly personalities from pre-modern times
then the search may be difficult. However, if you look at the
tradition in more general terms then things are quite different. The
dashanami sannyasa tradition in particular is far stronger in the
central Himalayan belt stretching from Himachal to Nepal, as well the
Narmada Valley from Amarkantak to Bharuch, than it is in southern
India, even though the South has had a strong scholarly tradition. One
can hardly refer to these sannyasi-s from various traditional akhada-s
as neo-Vedantins. There have been, for several centuries, people from
various communities among these sannyasi-s, mostly Dashanami-s and a
few Udasin-s. Jaldhar even mentioned one Sadhvi Narmada Giri who was a
Rajput princess in her purvashrama! From my explorations among these
groups, this does not seem unusual at all.

The Ramanandi-s are far from being a recent group. They have been
around for 700 years.
