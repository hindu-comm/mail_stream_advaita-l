I am not taking any stance with respect to guNa-karma-vibhAga here at all.



I am also not talking of svadharma and paradharma here.



Ultimately, mumukshutva and knowing/being brahman are beyond all dharma-s.

However, being born a brAhmaNa does not guarantee that mumukshutva arises

in the mind. There is also no guarantee that knowing Atman is nearest to the

brAhmaNa and progressively farther away for other varNa-s.



In my personal experience with people, the mental block provided by pride in

high birth is often a huge one. That is all. Please do remember that the saMnyAsin

is required to shed not only personal property and home, but also the varNa and

gotra given by birth.
