Dear Sunilji,

As regards Sathyakaama he could not say who his father was but listening to
his story the Guru inferred that he could have had a Brahmin lineage.
However if the story is further investigated it would become clear that the
Guru assigned him to be the cowheard of the aashrama and he attained gnaana
in the process of his work.

In other words, the Guru found the best method for him to attain Moksha.

Again these are really exceptions.  All I was cautioning was not to make
exception as the rule.  More we talk of the exceptions more they become
important and the less we talk of the rule the less it becomes important!

Now, God's Testing, teasing and playing are part of the bhakthi cult which
is again part of the Saguna Brahma Aaradhana.   There are no rules between
Him and his devotee but only the maaya leela.  They are aagamic view points
and are ultimately dwaithic in nature.

Sankara's advaithic treatise in Bhakthi maarga is in Sivaananda Lahari.  I
once had a chance to post my commentaries on this famous composition of
Sankara in another blog and I will post some excerpts separately for the
benefit of our readers.

Regards,
Anbu
