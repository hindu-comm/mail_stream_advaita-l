Hare Krishna

Yes, that is true, shankara himself gives this assurance in bruhadAraNyaka 
4-4-22 : evaM kAmya varjitaM nityaM karmajAtaM sarvaM AtmajnAnOtpatti 
dvAreNa mOksha sAdhanatvaM pratipadyate.  Here shankara clearly says 
'desireless' routine action is the sAdhana for the mOksha.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
