Jaldhar,

I look forward to your film script for 'I was a Teenage Alien Jnani'

Michael :-]

.  Should jnana -- the complete 
knowlege of ones identity with Brahman -- arise (and it can arise in any 
sentient being who posesses chetana, viveka, etc. whether they be 
Brahmana, Shudra, foreigner, devata, AI-powered robot or alien), vairagya 
inevitably results.  At that point the knower of Brahman takes to sannyasa 
not because it is a sanctioned behavior but because it is the only thing 
that makes sense in his situation.
