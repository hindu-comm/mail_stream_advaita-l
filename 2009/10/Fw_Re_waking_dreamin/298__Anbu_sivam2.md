Dear Sunilji,

The discussion is about Sanyasa aasrama and who is qualified for it.  So I
quoted the postulation of the Veda and such seers as Vyasa.  I am confronted
with an exceptional act of one particular Aacharyaa of one particular Mutt.
On that basis a judgement was made as follows:

"So, this argument that the jnAna mArga is to be limited to only brAhmaNa-s
and that people of other varNa-s have no adhikAra to become saMnyAsins *would
seem like an ultra-conservative view that is not upheld even by some of the
most notable AcAryas of advaita vedAnta tradition."
*
The fact remains that none of the Sankara, Ramanuja or Madhwa Mutts admit as
inmates anyone other than those who were Brahmanas.  As far as the
non-Brahmins of Tamilnadu were concerned there have been/are numerous
Aadheenams all under their Aagamic brands.  Generally Sankaracharyas do not
interfere with aagamic institutions.  However they are never considered as
inimical institutions.  Only the DMK govt. has been encouraging the aagamic
institutions to be against the Kanchi Mutt.  Such problem does not arise in
Karnataka or any other state.  The naattukkottai aadheenam brands itself as
vedantic and surely not aagamic.  So they were coming close to the Sankara
Mutt.  I hope these institutions last and do good work to their community.
But this is besides the point.  Sankara or Ramanuja or Madhwa Mutts do not
as a clear policy advocate establishment of non-Brahmin Mutts and neither do
they admit any of the non-Brahmins sanyaasis into their own Mutt. That is
how all the Aachaaryaas of the three Vedaanthic institutions have behaved in
their entire past except one perhaps for good reason.

Is this ultra-conservative view?  Who would sanction a liberal view and on
what basis?  Are there really number of 'notable Achaaryas' bent on setting
a new tradition?  In that case is there a known conflict between aachaaryaas
ongoing?

All I am saying is that exception proves the opposite.
