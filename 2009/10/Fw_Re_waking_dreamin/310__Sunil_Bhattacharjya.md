Dear Anbuji,

I am against the view that God tests human beings as God as I understand must be knowing how a human being is and he does not need to test. But a guru must test his prospective disciples before initiation. Now if a qualified guru had found a non-brahmin as qualified to be his disciple why you and me should worry. Noboby ever questioned when Satyakama was initiated. If we mean destiny as the consequence of pururushartha then don't you think that one must take into account what one did or did not do in this life as well. Actions of this life may give a particular adhikara to some one, who might not have had that adhikara by birth. Do you think it is logical. I await comments from you and the other scholars.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Quote: "...Whether a non-brAhmaNa can become a saMnyAsin..."

My answer is, there is no scriptural sanction for non-brahmin to don ochre
robe for such permission would have then given a valid reason as to their
purushartha. However non-Brahmins set up Mutts and become inmates most of
them aagama based rarely Vedantic. They are as good as buddhist sanghams

Vedaantic purushaarthas are clearly valid only for the Brahmins and who can
deny that it has scriptural sanction. Others have other purusharthas and
that is how their guna-karmas are divined.

Aren't we going back in circle again and again?
