Quote: "...Whether a non-brAhmaNa can become a saMnyAsin..."

My answer is, there is no scriptural sanction for non-brahmin to don ochre
robe for such permission would have then given a valid reason as to their
purushartha.  However non-Brahmins set up Mutts and become inmates most of
them aagama based rarely Vedantic.  They are as good as buddhist sanghams

Vedaantic purushaarthas are clearly valid only for the Brahmins and who can
deny that it has scriptural sanction.  Others have other purusharthas and
that is how their guna-karmas are divined.

Aren't we going back in circle again and again?
