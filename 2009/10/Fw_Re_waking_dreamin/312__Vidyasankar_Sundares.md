Sorry, that is where you are dead wrong. That there is scriptural sanction for
all dvija-s to enter the traditional saMnyAsASrama is affirmed by sureSvara in
his vArttika on the bRhadAraNyaka. As you know, dvija includes all those who
have the upanayana saMskAra.

There are only four purushArthas for all human beings. Of these, moksha is no
exclusive property of any varNa. What do you mean by vedAntic purushArthas
in the plural? Or are you redefining the word purushArtha?
