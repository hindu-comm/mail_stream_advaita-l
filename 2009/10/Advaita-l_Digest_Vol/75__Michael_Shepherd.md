I agree with Vijayaji. One need not look further than the ashrama one is
presently fulfilling.. As one who is making, and thoroughly enjoying, every
effort to fill vanaprastha with all that it should be; and bearing in mind
that it's said that babies born today are likely to live to a hundred years,
then vanaprastha could be the great widespread spiritual adventure of the
21st century. And those who then are ready for sannyasin will know the
moment if and when it comes.

Hello,

I have read with interest the e-mails on sannyasa. I am certain that
Sannyasa ashrama is not meant to only to impose restrictions and
inflict difficulties on holder of that ashram. It is meant to enable
the ashram holder to obtain jnana and practical spiritual knowledge.
This may not be possible as long as one is physically or mentally
wedded to the gross world and its objects.

Some may find it possible to remove themselves physically from the
vicinity of things they were attached to in previous ashramas but for
many this detachment in later years has to be a mental one. Getting
over the attachment to gross world  is difficult even with good
intention. I have heard that the great rishi Sivananda said that
Sanyasa of renouncing the world is not for everyone because some then
only take to begging for things they once had rather than seeing beyond
into the spiritual world.

It is better for most people to cultivate detachment and compassion
within the world rather than take an extreme step and renounce the
world they have known.
