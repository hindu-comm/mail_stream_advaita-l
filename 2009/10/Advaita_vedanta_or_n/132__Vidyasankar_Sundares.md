That is not the real issue here, is it? The zeal with which one proclaims jnAna 

as the only means to mukti needs to be tempered with the recognition that

there are numerous aids to the process of removing ajnAna.



The bhAshyas on the prasthAna trayI are chockful of references to such means-

darSanopAya, jnAna-pratipatti-hetu, jnAna-sahakAri-kAraNatva etc. I see no 

acknowledgement of these citations from those who seem to be uncompromising

in their championing of jnAna!



Regards,

Vidyasankar
