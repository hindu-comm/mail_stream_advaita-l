Bhaskar, you know exactly what I mean! I am criticizing the methodology of

those who think they can extract "truer" and "more authentic" meaning from

the source texts.



When I say these are not fossilized texts, I mean that you cannot attempt

to decry all later interpreters and then somehow miraculously "retrieve" the

"original" intent and meaning preserved in the source texts.

It is I who cannot find the intended meaning in the above assertion!



The commentaries of the later AcArya-s are also similarly smRti, for those who

truly value tradition! You are making an entirely unwarranted distinction between

the mUla bhAshyakAra and those who came after him in the sampradAya.
