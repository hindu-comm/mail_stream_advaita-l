sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

In the hands of a true traditionalist, the prasthAna trayI and its 
bhAshyas are living texts in guiding the thought process towards brahman. 
The true value of a sampradAya lies not in a fossilized text and 
commentary but in how the texts speak to us in this day and age.

>  Kindly pardon me I am not able to get the intended meaning of your 
above assertion!!  'A saMpradAya lies not in a fossilized text & 
commentary'...what exactly does it mean prabhuji??  Over the ages shruti & 
smruti texts  do not undergo any change  and nobody dared to make even an 
attempt to change it to suit to the current day & age.. so in a sense, 
these texts too are fossilized texts and as you know these texts are the 
'base' of any orthodox & bonafide saMpradAya. We cannot cite the above 
explanation and say : our saMpradAya is not based on fossilized texts like 
shruti-s & smruti-s!!  Likewise, what our bhagavatpaada gives us in the 
form of his commentary, should be treated on par with smruti if not shruti 
(coz. on our own, with our conditioned minds cannot derive the true 
meaning of these texts directly!!)and the saMpradAya to which we belong to 
and the sampradAyavAdi-s who are carrying the flag should ever be indebted 
to 'mUlabhAshyakAra' & his works...We cannot claim that fossilized texts & 
my mUlAcharya-s commentaries on it are not suitable to this day and age 
and hence we have to resort to the commentaries of later Acharya-s who 
have the 'better understanding' of current trend, date and age!! 

I onceagain request you to clarify what is this fossilized texts and 
commentary that you are talking here & that which goes against the 'true 
value of the saMpradAya' ...

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
