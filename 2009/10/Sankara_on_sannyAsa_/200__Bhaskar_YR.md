But Bhakti can be beyond the discharge of one's duties. Is there any hard 
and fast rule that the brahmin cannot take the path of Bhakti?

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

For that matter bhakti is NOT a separate path, it is a 'sAmAnya dharma' to 
both jnAna & karma.  And a brahmin can approach his svadharma with bhakti 
& shraddhA for the attainment of jnAna.  So, IMO, the path of bhakti is 
not an exclusive one to svadharma.  The bhakti should blend together with 
jnAna and karma.  The jnAni, who has realized the non-dual reality is also 
a bhakta and his bhakti is called as parAbhakti. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
