Logic suggests that since advaita 'can be experienced but not described',
then therefore neither can ' not advaita' be described.. though of course
dvaita can..

But as I have argued here before he wasn't exactly an Advaitin.
Nevertheless what is relevant for this conversation is that he did indeed
live the life of a sannyasi.

sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Jaldhar prabhuji

I've seen your arguments before...But prabhuji, still I am not clear in
what way Sri parama haMsa falling short from the advaitin status??
Prabhuji, kindly clarify are you saying here he was not an advaitin but
realized the ultimate what is enshrined in advaita vedanta  through the
grace of kAli mataji??  Have you come to this conclusion because, Sri
paramahaMsa, being a brahmin,  has not studied the shAstra-s in a
traditional way & did not do sAdhana like shravaNa, manana etc. which are
prescribed for the dvija-s.    As you know, he has learnt the intricacies
of advaita through wandering monk tOtApuri & achieved the ultimate
experience nirvikalpa samAdhi...Under these circumstances, how can it be
concluded that 'Sri Ramakrishna ParamahaMsa was not an advaitin'??  Is it
because of his not so scholarly, 'childlike' teachings you have come to
this conclusion prabhuji??  Kindly clarify.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
