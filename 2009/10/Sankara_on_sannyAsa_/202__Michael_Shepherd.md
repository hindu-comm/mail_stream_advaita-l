My understanding is that the ultimate step for a bhakta is jnana, and for
jnana, bhakti !
And as you say, the gift of the Lord in Whom both merge.

I was talking about Bhakti for Ishvara ie. the Ishvara pranipata. Bhakti by
itself has a general meaning of liking or regards. Rama had his bhaktas so
also Ravana had his. Knowing the difference is jnana. So absolutely
jana-less bhakti has no meaning. Jnana gives direction. Without jnana one
may end up worshipping the demons. Bhakti is the driving force that busts
the ego and takes the person nearer to God and I understand that God helps
the ardent bhaktas by giving them the knowledge of the ultimate truth.

But Bhakti can be beyond the discharge of one's duties. Is there any hard
and fast rule that the brahmin cannot take the path of Bhakti?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

For that matter bhakti is NOT a separate path, it is a 'sAmAnya dharma' to
both jnAna & karma. And a brahmin can approach his svadharma with bhakti
& shraddhA for the attainment of jnAna. So, IMO, the path of bhakti is
not an exclusive one to svadharma. The bhakti should blend together with
jnAna and karma. The jnAni, who has realized the non-dual reality is also
a bhakta and his bhakti is called as parAbhakti.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
