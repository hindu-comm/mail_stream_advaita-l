This is not ignorance but, quite frankly, deliberate utterance of untruth. Especially in the context of discussion related brahmavidya, nothing could be more ignominious. Best to conserve your precious time and energy in something more fruitful- as Shankara says dushtarka suviramyatam.

Appreciate your valuable input in this discussion.
