Public figures like Janaka may continue to appear to practice karma as an 
example to others. 



praNAms Sri Jaldhar prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes, this is what exactly shankara too says in sUtra bhAshya (3-4-15 - 
kAmakAreNa chaike ) while refuting the stand of sUtra 3-4-3 wherein it was 
argued that Janaka and others performed sacrifices even after attaining 
knowledge of Brahman. Shankara clarifies here that some have abandoned all 
works according to their own liking. Some may like to work to set an 
example to others after attaining knowledge, while others may abandon all 
works. But there is no compulsion on the knowers of Brahman or liberated 
sages as regards work.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
