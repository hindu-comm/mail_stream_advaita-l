I have taken the fire rituals as the example as it is mandatory for the Brahmnas of the three Ashramas but this is not to the exclusion of the other karmas, and though the other karmas have not been mentioned.

As regards the Statement The Buddhists want extinction. They do not want liberation like
Astikas because they do not believe there is any state to be liberated
to. again we are in a difficult situation. In "Prajnaparamita", which is considered the Bible of the Mahayana and it shorter versions the "Diamond- sutra" and the "Heart- Sutra" it is said that the liberation is to get out of the five skandhas (which are the Buddhist version of the five koshas) and to have the non-separate state but not non-existent. Nagarjuna also says that "Shunya" is not Non-existence.

A clarification here. The shastras always talk about renouncing the fire because agnihotra is the archetype of karmas. But everything concerning agnihotra is applicable mutatis mutandis to sandhya, or working in a factory, or any other type of action.

He rejects more than heaven but all purposeful goals (of which attaining heaven is the archetype.)

The Buddhists want extinction. They do not want liberation like Astikas because they do not believe there is any state to be liberated to.

Once again let me stress that any intentional action is an impediment to moksha not just "Vedic rituals."

Public figures like Janaka may continue to appear to practice karma as an example to others. Furthermore an emperor with a vast number of ministers, soldiers, and servants at his disposal might not actually have that much "work" to do.
