... and still think that I'm not wasting my time here because I understand
that without perfecting sAdhana
cAtushTaya, I can't be a mumukshu and way far from adhikAri of saMnyAsa.

Hare Krishna

And after perfecting sAdhana chatushtaya, shankara asks us to do brahma 
jignAnsa (for example shankara's commentary on the word 'atha' in the 
first sUtra)..
And in that sAdhana chatushtaya, two sAdhana-s are. : ihAmutra phala bhOga 
virAga' & shama damAdi shatsaMpatti  which are to be perfected before 
brahma jignAsa...If it all these two sAdhana-s relate to saNyAsa ( because 
saNyAsi-s are advised to do shama damAdi sAdhana & ofcourse vairAgya) then 
before becoming the 'mumukshu',  sanyAsa is recommended at the stage of 
sAdhana chatushtaya itself  is it not??  So, can we say before talking 
about brahma jignAsa, the aspirant should first take vividisha saNyAsa 
during the practice of sAdhana chatushtaya??  ..Kindly clarify your stand 
on this.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
