Sunilji,

*Sanyasa is abandonment of karma of whatever variety, kaamya and nishkaamya.
*

Nishkaamakarma brings a Guru to the karmi.  Sanyasi already got a guru!  He
therefore is in no need to perform nishkaamakarma.  He has to do
nidhidyaasanaam of what his guru has taught.  That is all expected of him.
That is part of sanyaasa dharma.  A jeevan muktha not only does not do karma
but also he has no dharma to observe.  (Whatever he does is considered
dharma).  In any case only a realized person knows another realized person.
In other words, non-realized person cannot know of a realized person to make
a judgment.  The beauty of it is that a realized person would have nothing
to judge of another realized person.  Once Kanchi Periava walked in front of
Ramanasramam but never entered it or even turned his head towards it while
everyone in the Aashramam except two - Bhagavan (and a widow who narrated
this story) - came out and prostrated to the passing ParamaacharyaaL.  This
tells a whole lot about two gnanis when they are in proximity to each other!
