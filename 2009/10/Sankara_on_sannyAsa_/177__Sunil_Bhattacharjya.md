Dear Vidyasankarji,

I think what Bhaskarji says may appear to many to be a question like whrther the egg came first or the chicken. But it need not be so. I shall give an example, only to convey the idea though one may find fault with the example. If one controls the breath, ie.does pranayama, then the mind becomes calm and controlled. If one controls the mind by dhyana the breaths get controlled automatically. 

Simalarly a Jnani does niskama karma as he is a samadrasti and he realises everybody and everything is Brahman and he had overcome his self-interest. Now if one starts doing Niskama karma, say because one's guru advised one to do so or one wanted to follow the Bhagavad Gita without really realizing the merits of it, even then a time will come when he would automatically start doing Niskama karma, call it by force of habit if you like. Eventually he would realise the merit of doing the niskama karma and that he is no different from others and thus the Jnana will dawn on him.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Bhaskar, I have been following this debate to the best of my ability and time constraints, but can you point out to me one person/post where AtmajnAna is declared to be the sole property of the ASrama called sannyAsa?

What do you mean by the above? jnAna does not come from karma, but karma yoga involving karmaphala sannyAsa = jnAna nishThA? How?

Again, don't you think you are breaking down a strawman here?
