sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare krishna

Sri Vidya prabhuji :

Bhaskar, I have been following this debate to the best of my ability and 
time constraints, but can you point out to me one person/post where 
AtmajnAna is declared to be the sole property of the ASrama called 
sannyAsa?

bhaskar :

you might have not read the ongoing series both here and in advaitin 
list!!  where it is repeatedly said jeevan mukti is something different 
from Atma jnAna & for jeevan mukti there should invariably be jnAna + 
saNyAsa...and slogans like : "The institution of sannyasa, as a ashrama, 
thus becomes both sacrosanct and indispensable for a Self-Knower".
This indispensability is what I am debating here...Hope it is clear to you 
now.

Sri Vidya prabhuji :

What do you mean by the above? jnAna does not come from karma, but karma 
yoga involving karmaphala sannyAsa = jnAna nishThA? How?

bhaskar :

here karmaphala tyAga rUpa saNyAsa is nothing but ahaMkAra tyAga, karma 
phala tyAga, samatva buddhi and IshwarArpaNa...as explained by shankara in 
geeta verses like sukha dukhe same krutva, siddhyasiddhO samO bhUtvA, 
samtvaM sarva bhuteshu etc. and  for those who follow this krishna himself 
assures saMsiddhi, janma bandha vinirmuktatva and ofcourse ultimately 
blissful everlasting state (padaM gacchantyanAmayaM). If you think jnAna 
nishThA state & jnAna phala is something different from this kindly let me 
know.

Sri Vidya prabhuji :

Again, don't you think you are breaking down a strawman here?

bhaskar :

prabhuji, IMHO, if you read the series on 'jnAna + saNyAsa = jeevanmukti' 
carefully, you will come to know how this strawman has been erected 
through some selective quotes from shankara bhAshya !! 

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
