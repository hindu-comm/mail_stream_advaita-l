atha being a loaded word, the commentary goes 10-15 pages and all of that is
to indicate sAdhana cAtushTaya, alright.

Interesting derivation, but I'd like to differ in the outlook here please.
Just because pre-saMnyAsa, one is required to have shaTsampat, it doesn't
mean one has to give up post-saMnyAsa, does it? So instead of adding
additional complications, I understand the meaning of "before brahma
jignAsa" as to mean "before saMnyAsa", but not to give them up
post-saMnyAsa. saMnyAsa then becomes the domain of someone to do
brahmajignAsa, which is when vividishA is advised in jIvanmukti viveka.

praNAms,
