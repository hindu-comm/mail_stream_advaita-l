Bhagavatam says that to an ardent Bhakta God Himself gives the Jnana, 
which I understand as the end of birth.. That contradicts the statement :

The Brahmins are not qualified for non-gnana path to transcend samsaara.  
If a Brahmin follows these maargas then he will be born again.

Again this is the issue of observing one's own dharma (svadharma) in all 
sincerity  is it not??  When the shAstra is proscribed brAhmin some vidhi 
& vidhAna, why he should search for some 'easy' outings??  That is the 
reason why krishna cautions us : svadharme nidhanaM shreyaH paradharmO 
bhayAvahaH...For a dvija, vedOkta shravaNAdi is direct & prescribed path 
for the ultimate realization & he should not look for any 'short cuts' for 
his convenience...vedO nityamadheeyataaM, this is what  the advice to 
dvija-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
