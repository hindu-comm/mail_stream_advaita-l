You can and should state facts in a way that is more respectful.

Unfortunately there have been a few other instances where this otherwise 
informative discussion has been marred by posters who have let their 
emotions get the better of them.  We moderators mostly take a hands-off 
approach.  We prefer to treat readers as adults who are capable of 
self-control.  It would be a shame if we had to start being more 
heavy-handed so lets keep things at a calmer level shall we?
