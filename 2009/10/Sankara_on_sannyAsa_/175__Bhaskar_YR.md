karmayoga and sannyasa are diametrically opposed - "like the mountain and 
the mustard seed or the east coast and the west coast" are the analogies 
that Shankara uses to drive home this point. 

praNAms
Hare Krishna

The declaration like above onceagain shows the 'poor fund of knowledge' 
what these pabhuji-s have on  krishna bhagavAn and shankara's stand on 
karma yOga & its phala.  Even a cursory reading of the geeta verses like : 
saMnyAsaH karma yOgascha niHshreyasakarAvudhau, yO na dveshti na kAnkshati 
he is NOTHING BUT nitya saMnyAsi..sthirabuddhirasammudhO brahmavid 
brahmaNi stithaH...etc. they will easily come to know atleast karma yOga & 
saNyAsa are not poles apart and there is no huge difference like mountain 
and mustard seed...Shankara himself clarifies this beautifully in geeta 
bhAshya : karmaphala saMkalpa saMnyAsAt saMnyAsitvaM, yOgAngatvena cha 
karmAnushTAnAt, karmaphala saMkalpasya cha chitta vikshepahetOH parityAgAt 
yOgitvaM cha iti gauNam ubhayaM..The main problem here is reading the 
selective bhAshya vAkya-s out of context and concluding on their own to 
float their pet theories..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
