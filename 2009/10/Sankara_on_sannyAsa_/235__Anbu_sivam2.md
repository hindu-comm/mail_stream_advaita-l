False Sanyaasis were there from time immemorial.  We know that Adi Sankara
himself lamented of this in his famous Bhajagovindam as follows:

jaTilO muNDii luJNchhitakeshaH
kaashhaayaambarabahukR^itaveshhaH .
pashyannapi cana pashyati muuDhaH
udaranimittaM bahukR^itaveshhaH

I have heard of the jokes on these pretenders that as Brahmana Sanyasis they
will beg during the morining for the midday meal and change into bouddha
sanyasis to seek alms for the evening meal!
