Sunilji,

Clearly the Bouddhas postulated the option between rotting in samsaara
(sarvam dhukkam dhukkam sarvam kshaNikam kshaNikam) and becoming extinct in
soonya (niodha).  They never upheld Existence as the ultimate objective.

Advaita Vedaantis alone upheld Sat as irreducible and unchanging.  It is
they who advocated Sat as the summom bonum.

Buddhists were the ultimate challenge to the Advaitins and the Advaitins
roundly defeated them in Bharatavarsha.  This is history.
