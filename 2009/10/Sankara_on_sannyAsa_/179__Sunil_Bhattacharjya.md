Michaelji,

Yes, the Jnani is a brahmin in the true sense of the term if you believe in the verse "Brahma janati iti brahman", even though by birth he may not be born in the brahmin's varna and he has to discharge the duties of the non-brahmin varna he is born in

Sunil.

Sunil ji,

Would it not follow that the jnani would then fulfil the varna of brahmin ?
And that, rather than being dependent on birth alone, varna is the duty in
the whole society which one fulfils, at anhy one time, irrespective of birth
? That seems far nearer the divine intention than human 'rules'.

Michael

Dear Vidyasankarji,

I think what Bhaskarji says may appear to many to be a question like
whrther the egg came first or the chicken. But it need not be so. I shall
give an example, only to convey the idea though one may find fault with the
example. If one controls the breath, ie.does pranayama, then the mind
becomes calm and controlled. If one controls the mind by dhyana the breaths
get controlled automatically.

Simalarly a Jnani does niskama karma as he is a samadrasti and he realises
everybody and everything is Brahman and he had overcome his self-interest.
Now if one starts doing Niskama karma, say because one's guru advised one to
do so or one wanted to follow the Bhagavad Gita without really realizing the
merits of it, even then a time will come when he would automatically start
doing Niskama karma, call it by force of habit if you like. Eventually he
would realise the merit of doing the niskama karma and that he is no
different from others and thus the Jnana will dawn on him.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Bhaskar, I have been following this debate to the best of my ability and
time constraints, but can you point out to me one person/post where
AtmajnAna is declared to be the sole property of the ASrama called sannyAsa?

What do you mean by the above? jnAna does not come from karma, but karma
yoga involving karmaphala sannyAsa = jnAna nishThA? How?

Again, don't you think you are breaking down a strawman here?
