VedanthakO braahmanasyaath kshathriyO vijayeebhavEth
vaisyO dhanasamruddhasyaath soodhras sukhmavaapnuyaath.

In order to pursue gnana maarga of vedaantha the abandonment of karma is a
pre-requisite to which only the Brahmin is qualified.  Therefore only the
brahmin can enter the sanyaasa aasrama that requires the abandonment of
karmas.

Moksha is an entitlement of all irrespective of varna and bhagavan has
prescribed the other maargas such as karma, yoga and bhakthi.  Karma does
not mean vedic karma alone that the brahmins perform.  It means all karmas
by all varnas.

When Sankara says that only by Gnana can one attain Moksha he is addressing
the Brahmins and not other varnas.
