For that matter 'mrutyudevata' yama dharma rAja too, who is 'always' busy 
in taking our lives with his pAsha, settling our accounts with the help of

for those who want believe a 'hand' behind death :-))...and nachiketa 
'waited' for him & denied all other comforts for the sake of brahma vidya. 
 Unfortunately, here in this episode both teacher & pupil were not 
saNyAsi-s :-(( and satyakAma jAbAli , uddAlaka svetaketu of chAndOgya, 
krishna - arjuna in geeta, bheeshma, vidhura in mahAbhArata were too 
non-saNyAsi-s who were engaged themselves in giving & taking brahma 
vidya:-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
