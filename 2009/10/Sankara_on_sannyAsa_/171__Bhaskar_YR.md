Moksha is an entitlement of all irrespective of varna and bhagavan has
prescribed the other maargas such as karma, yoga and bhakthi.  Karma does
not mean vedic karma alone that the brahmins perform.  It means all karmas
by all varnas.

When Sankara says that only by Gnana can one attain Moksha he is 
addressing
the Brahmins and not other varnas.

Though I agree that all varNAshrami-s are eligible for the mOksha, I dont 
want to be part with the multiple path-s for mOksha...Shruti  itself clear 
that jnAna & ONLY jnAna can remove the ignorance & nothing else (nAnyaH 
paNthA vidyateyanAya)...But this jnAna is NOT the sole property of the 
residents of saNyAsAshrama...Those who do not have the vedAdhikAra they 
too can attain the 'same' result by itihAsa purANa...but fact remains that 
they have to have that Atma jnAna only nothing else and this jnAna does 
not come from the purusha tantra 'karma' and this karma has to be elevated 
to the status of karmaphala saNyAsa rUpa karma yOga to get jnAna nishTe.

Dear Karthik prabhuji, thanks for your reference from brahma sUtra...I 
shall look at it when I go home today.  And be rest assured I am going to 
disprove NOT shankara but those who are declaring : WITHOUT EMBRACING 
SANYAASA ASHRAMA THERE IS NO MUKTI WHATSOEVER :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
