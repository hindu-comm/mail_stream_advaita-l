It's my understanding that a sannyasi may either renounce the world as a
solitary, or having renounced the world, remain in it to teach the world.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Those who have isolated themselves will always remain 'anonymous' and they 
never ever come to the notice of general public.  And those who have 
renounced the world but still remain in it to do 'dharma prachAra' they 
have to follow the obligations of society...A saNyAsi cannot be a 
'svecchAchAri' and he has to observe some injunctions prescribed for him 
like shama, dama, praNavOpAsana etc...That is the reason why even today 
saNyAsi jagadguru-s doing upAsana, dhyAna, pooja etc. in their respective 
peeThams.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
