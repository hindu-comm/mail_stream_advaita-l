praNAms 
Hare Krishna 

I was talking about Bhakti for Ishvara ie. the Ishvara pranipata. 

>  Yes, a brAmaNa can also do this Ishwara praNipAta without compromising 
his svadharma..And for him mOksha is guaranteed...And also those who do 
this bhakti without other worries & thoughts, leaving everything to HIM, 
they too would finally get THAT...Bhagavan himself assures this in 
'ananyAschintayantOmAM ye janAH paryupAsate, sarva dharman parityajya 
mamekaM sharaNaM vraja...etc. 

Bhakti by itself has a general meaning of liking or regards. Rama had his 
bhaktas so also Ravana had his. Knowing the difference is jnana. 

>  Yes, that is the reason why krishna says bhakta-s are four types, 
Artha, arthArthi, jignAsu & mumukshu..Obviously, A mumukshu's bhakti to 
the lord is much more superior to an arthArthi's bhakti.     

So absolutely jana-less bhakti has no meaning. Jnana gives direction. 
Without jnana  one may end up worshipping the demons. Bhakti is the 
driving force that busts the ego and takes the person nearer to God and  I 
understand that God helps the ardent bhaktas by giving them the knowledge 
of the ultimate truth. 

>  yes, mama adheenaM karmiNAM karma phalaM jnAninAM cha jnAnaphalaM..(it 
is all in HIS hands says shankara in the introduction to 15th chapter of 
geeta). 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!! 
bhaskar
