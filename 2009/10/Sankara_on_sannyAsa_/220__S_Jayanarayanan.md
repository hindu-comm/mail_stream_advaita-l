I do not see any personal attack here, just a statement of fact.

Sankara says: "BrahmasaMstha is to be completely absorbed in Brahman, with no other occupation but to be established in THAT. THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THOSE IN THE FIRST THREE ASHRAMAS."

You maintain: "BrahmasaMstha IS POSSIBLE in the first three ashramas."

Your position is diametrically opposed to Sankara's.

At worst, you are willing to directly contradict Sankara whenever his commentary does not suit your taste.

At best (if can be called "best"), Sankara is stressing on the need for sannyAsa to attain BrahmasaMstha, whereas you are downplaying it.

Regards,
Kartik
