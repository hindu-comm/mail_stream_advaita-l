A clarification here.  The shastras always talk about renouncing the fire 
because agnihotra is the archetype of karmas.  But everything concerning 
agnihotra is applicable mutatis mutandis to sandhya, or working in a 
factory, or any other type of action.

He rejects more than heaven but all purposeful goals (of which attaining 
heaven is the archetype.)

The Buddhists want extinction.  They do not want liberation like Astikas 
because they do not believe there is any state to be liberated to.

Once again let me stress that any intentional action is an impediment to 
moksha not just "Vedic rituals."

Public figures like Janaka may continue to appear to practice karma as an 
example to others.  Furthermore an emperor with a vast number of 
ministers, soldiers, and servants at his disposal might not actually have 
that much "work" to do.
