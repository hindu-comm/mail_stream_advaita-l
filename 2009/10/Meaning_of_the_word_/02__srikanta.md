Though the word "sharada" and "Saraswati",means the same,that is the
Goddess of learning,"the word "Sharada" has wider significance,especially
the "sharada Peetam" was earlier situated at Kashmir,and still holds the
same name in Kashmir.though the word "Saraswati"means "one who flows
easily",that is the Vak or speech,the word "sharada"means clarity and
profound learning,i.e Visharada.Incidentally, the people who hail from
West Bengal were called "Saraswathas",and Gaudapada was the first Guru,who
lead the Gauda Brahmans.
