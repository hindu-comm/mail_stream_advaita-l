I hope I won't be accused of being an Indologist when I note that sara in
Vedic is a stream, and thus Saraswati means heavenly stream.. how sharada
came also to mean 'autumnal' is for speculation. But there's something
attractive to me in wisdom as a clear, pure flow...

So Gaudapada could be saying 'go with the flow'.. :)

Subject: [Advaita-l] Meaning of the word "sharada"



with reference to Michael Shepherd's Email regarding the above topic,the
word "Sharada"has different meanings.In conventional terms,this means
'pure','Vishuddhi",this is by Sri.Adi shankara.The word also
means"Mature".The colour of Saraswati is "white",which signifies
purity.The word also means "timid".In both the adwaitic and Buddhist
terminology,thie word means "maturity".Gaudapada says in his karikas:
      "Vaishardyam tu vai nasti bhedhe vicaratam sada
      bhedhanimnah prtagvadah tasmatte krpanah smrtah"

Those who evel always in the difference,do not have maturity
always engrossed in difference and who cavil,they are said to be miserly.

                                                          N.Srikanta.
