Sunilji

As a poet, I love to make philological associations, even when they're
suspect !

Tne dhatus vi- and vish- convey a sense of movement and both have one
derived meaning 'flowing into'.
If the Vedic cast of mind saw associations with autumn, and expertise ('he
was an expert : in him knowledge flowed without hindrance'...) then as our
'Autumn term' starts up in colleges and schools and Saraswati presides... :)

Michaelji,

Another way of deriving the same is from "saras", ie. lake. Can we also find
a link between Sharada and Visharad (expert)?.

I hope I won't be accused of being an Indologist when I note that sara in
Vedic is a stream, and thus Saraswati means heavenly stream.. how sharada
came also to mean 'autumnal' is for speculation. But there's something
attractive to me in wisdom as a clear, pure flow...

So Gaudapada could be saying 'go with the flow'.. :)

with reference to Michael Shepherd's Email regarding the above topic,the
word "Sharada"has different meanings.In conventional terms,this means
'pure','Vishuddhi",this is by Sri.Adi shankara.The word also
means"Mature".The colour of Saraswati is "white",which signifies
purity.The word also means "timid".In both the adwaitic and Buddhist
terminology,thie word means "maturity".Gaudapada says in his karikas:
   "Vaishardyam tu vai nasti bhedhe vicaratam sada
   bhedhanimnah prtagvadah tasmatte krpanah smrtah"

Those who evel always in the difference,do not have maturity
always engrossed in difference and who cavil,they are said to be miserly.

                             N.Srikanta.
