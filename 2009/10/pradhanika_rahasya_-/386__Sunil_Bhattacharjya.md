Dear Anbuji,

To my knowledge the mantras can be recited in three ways, ie. (i) loudly, (ii) in whisper or with movement of lips and (iii) silently. A mantra is most effective if said silently. However for the hearing of others, ie. for public good, the mantras may have to recited loudly on special occasions. However there are exceptions in some cases such as in some occult practices. where the mantra has to be recited loudly to become more effective..

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Quote: "But, here in South India (especially where I go as a Ritvik) we
normally recite these quietly."

I agree and confirm that this is the practice in the south.
