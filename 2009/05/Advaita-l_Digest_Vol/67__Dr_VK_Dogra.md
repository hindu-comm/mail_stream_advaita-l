> ???????????? Namaste.??I have a few doubts regarding how we shall live. If time permits, kindly help me out with these 5 queries
> .
> 1) Are the paths to achieve material and spiritual rewards different? Or can they be the same?
> ?
> 2) Why should an evil-eye be effective? I mean, if a person works for his betterment, he is solely responsible for his success. How can an evil-eye affect it? Why are we giving it so much importance?
> ?
> 3) There is a difference in the teaching of different faiths with regard to rebirth. Hinduism and buddism talk about the phenomenon of?rebirth,whereas Islam and Christianity deny it? Why is this difference?
> ?
> 4) God is karma-phala-dhatha. According to our karma, he gives us what we deserve. Similarly, if a person deceives us,why should we not punish him.?Why does?the?scriptures expect us to forgive?
> ?
> 5) This world is such an imperfect place with so much inequality and injustice. How should we live - just accept things as they are or fight against them?
> ?
> Thank you in advance. All the very best to you for all your endeavours.
