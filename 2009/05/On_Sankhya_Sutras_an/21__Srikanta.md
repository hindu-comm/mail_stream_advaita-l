This is with reference to the discussion on Sankhya.The sankhya siddhanta
is similar to Vedanta cites Maya for the appearance of the plurality,where
as the Sankhya has the prakriti.The Pradhana is the cause of the world.In
Bhagawadgita,we have the Sloka:
The sankya and the Yoga are said to be different by the ignorant,but not
by the Pundits.
In BG we have many Sankhya terminologies,which shows that in ancient
times,Sankhya was also a system among the Rishis.We have a commentary by
Gaudapada on the Sankhya karikas by Ishwarakrishna.
