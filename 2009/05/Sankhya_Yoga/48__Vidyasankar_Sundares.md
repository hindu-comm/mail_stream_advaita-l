It seems to me that there are many misapprehensions of what sAmkhya is,
either in its upanishadic roots or in its mature, classical form as emboided in
the sAmkhya-kArikA.

purusha, prakRti and pradhAna are not three different things in sAmkhya.
Rather, pradhAna is a synonym for prakRti. Also, purusha is not one; there
are multiple purushas. Consequently, creation does not have one origin. 
Indeed, there is no one creation in classical sAmkhya. There are multiple
creations set into motion by multiple purushas via interaction with prakRti.

It is because these positions are problematic that vedAnta criticizes them.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
