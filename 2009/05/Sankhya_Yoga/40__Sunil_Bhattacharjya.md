Dear Bhadriahji,

Samkhya does not speak about God as He is "Asiddhah" ie. one cannot describe Him and His role. "Asiddhah" does not mean non-existent. Sankhya desists from talking about the Nirguna Brahman.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Please connect to what statement of mine you say no, and explain in more detail with some examples.



Thanks
