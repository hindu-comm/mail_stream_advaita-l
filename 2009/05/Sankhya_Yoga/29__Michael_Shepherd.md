Thanks. I think I get it ! it's a bit like Voltaire's 'Candide' -- one can
have the occasional democratic revelation, without necessarily being a
democrat or a Democrat !

The standard explanation I like to give is the United States is a
democracy and also has a political party called Democrats.  All Democrats
are democrats but all democrats are not Democrats.  In other words, a
"capital-D" Democrat belongs to a particular darshana of "small-d"
democrats.

That Samkhya/Yoga shares vocabulary and concepts with Vedanta is not
surprising as they do have a common root in Vedic tradition.
Shankaracharya does not deny this, he only says that their reading of
tradition is incorrect.

That "capital-S" Samkhyas share vocabulary and concepts with Gita,
Puranas, Ayurveda, Arthashastra etc. is not surprising as they have a
common root is a particular type of philosophical praxis we can call
"small-s" samkhya.
