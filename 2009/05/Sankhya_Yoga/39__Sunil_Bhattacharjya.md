Sri Bhattacharjya,

I personally would be very happy to accept your distinction about Samkhya,
which accords with the understanding I have been given.

It is a more 'constructive' and useful way of looking at Samkhya to see it
as a 'system and method of using the mind to progress in knowledge' (rather
similar to' Aristotle v. Plato' in the West); and taking 'not speaking of
God' no further than Yoga.

Indeed it could be seen as the mark of a greater devotion to God, never to
attempt to speak of Him.. belief unquestioned and unbruised !

Michael

Can we not say that classical Samkhya does not speak about God rather than
saying that Samkhya does not belierve in God. To my understanding whether it
is Classical Samkhya or Jainism or Buddhismnone ofthem denythe "Cause
and Effect".

I finally had a chance this weekend to look at the text of the upanishad
along with the bhashya of Shri Shankaracharya, the dipika of Swami
Shankarananda, and the dipika of Swami Narayana Tirth.

Based on those I would translate the verse as,

"The Eternality of the eternals, the Awareness of the aware, One but
ordaining the desires of many that Cause, known by the means of gaining
knowledge, is the God who removes all fetters.

Shankaracharya doesn't really explain sAMkhyayogAdhigamyam. He merely
repeats it without comment.

Swami Shankarananda (c. 14th century) is more descriptive:

sAMkhyayogadhigamyam | samyakhyAyate prakAshyata AtmatattvaM yena
viGYAnena tatsAMkhyaM yogo
jIvaparamAtmanostAdAtmyaGYAnaphalo'ShTA~ngayogarUpo
vaidikakarmAnuShTAnAdirUpo va |

In other words the means of attaining knowledge is either the 8-fold
classical yoga or the Vedic karmakanda. Practice of either results in the
knowledge of the unity of the jiva and paramatma.

Swami Narayana Tirth (c. 17th century) says

sAMkhyayogadhigamyam sAMkhyaM cha yogashcha sAMkhyayogau sAMkhyaM
vedAntamahAvAkyatAtparyajanyamahaMbrahmAsmIti samyagGYAnaM
yogastatsAdhanashravaNamanananidhidhyAsanAdistAbhyAM sAMkhyayogAdhigamyam
prApyam ...

Here samkhya is the study of the mahavakyas of Vedanta like aham brahmasmi
along with their meaning. Yoga is putting them into practice through
shravana, manana, and nidhidhyasana.


Observations:

This text does not refer to the classical, capital-S Samkhya which does not
believe in a God who is one but ordains the desires of many or is the first
cause of the universe. It could however be interpreted according to
classical Yoga which adds the tattva (category) of Ishvara to those of
Sankhya.

The commentator Swami Shankarananda leaves room for such an interpretation
as he says one of the kinds of samkhyayoga is the ashtanga yoga of Patanjali
but even then the goal of this is the jnana of the oneness of jiva and
paramatma -- a thoroughly Advaita Vedantic reading. The Yoga sutras
themselves only speak of samadhi.

The commentator Swami Narayana does not even grant this much and interprets
in terms of purely vedantic concepts.
