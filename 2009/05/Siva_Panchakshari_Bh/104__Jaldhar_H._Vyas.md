I think you are thinking of pranava varttika which is a commentary on the 
significance of omkara which is by Sureshvaracharya.  It is often included 
with editions of his Manasollasa (which is a commentary on 
Shankaracharyas' Dakshinamurti stotra) but it is a seperate work.

Shivapanchakshari Bhashya is by Padmapadacharya and is a commentary on the 
significance of om namah shivaya.  We have a copy of the Sanskrit text on 
our site at:
