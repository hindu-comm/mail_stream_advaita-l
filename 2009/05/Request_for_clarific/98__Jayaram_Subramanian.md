Dear sir,
Following are 2 statementswhere a physical example is given and a spiritual analogy is drawn. 

 1) A jar is essentially clay; but after the clay is fashioned in a particular way, it is called jar.Similarly, the universe in non-dual/Brahman, though the name and form create diversity. 

2) A jaroccupies space andwhen it breaks, the inner space merges with the outer space. Similarly, as life ends, soul joins Brahman.

Sir, I request youto throw more light on the above statements for better clarity.

Thank you.

Yours sincerely,
N S Jayaram
