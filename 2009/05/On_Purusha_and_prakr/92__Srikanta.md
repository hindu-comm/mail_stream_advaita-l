This is with reference to the above topic regarding the Sankhya
yoga.Sri.Sunil Bhattacharjee says purusha is lower than the prakrithi.This
is not so.The Purusha ,prakrithi and pradhana are the threefold divisions
that that the Sankhya yoga attributes to the creation of the
Universe.There is no separate Ishwara other than the Purusha in Sankhya
system.The Purusha mingles with the Prakrithi and creates the individual
souls.Pradhana is the material cause.In Bhagawad gita SriKrishna
says,"Mayam to prakrithi viddhi".When the Purusha through discrimination
realises that he is free,then the prakrithi departs from him just like a
dancer departs from the scene.

A parallel can be drawn with the Vishishtadwaita siddhanta of SriRamanuja.
He says that there are three fold divisions,Viz.cit,acit and Ishwara.This
can be compared to Purusha,prakrithi and pradhana.Only that Ramanuja
doesnot recognise Maya as SriShankara recognises Maya in his Adwaita
siddhanta.
