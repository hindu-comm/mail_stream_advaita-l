This is with reference to the discussion on the topic, free
will.Infact,when the karma starts to operate in the life pf a person,there
is no freewill.for instance,a hungry person has no free will.Free will may
act in certain cicumstances like "going to a picture",he may go or choose
to not going to the picture.In some circumstances,the doership cannot be
removed.
