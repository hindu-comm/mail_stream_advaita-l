I would say the same tools are to be used i.e. perception, introspection,
logic etc.  Spiritual knowledge is no different than any other kind of
knowledge.

praNAms Sri Jaldhar prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I think pravrutti mArga is recommended for achieving material prosperity
and nivrutti mArga for spiritual goal (i.e. Atma jnAna) is it not??  one is
objective knowledge and another is subjective intuitive realization...So
prabhuji IMHO, spiritual knowledge is something different from any other
objective knowledge...Ofcourse, I am assuming here spiritual knowledge as
adhyAtma jnAna or Atma jnAna..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
