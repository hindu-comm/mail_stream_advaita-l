I would like to put this question to you:
If an action is done because of purva saMskAra, then we can identify a cause
for it. However, if an action is done out of "free will" then, if my
understaing of the word 'free' in 'free will' is correct, it would require
that it be a causeless action. Because if it has a cause, it couldn't be
free. How does one account for a causeless cause?

B G Tilak attributes this to Brahman/Atman. I find it hard to agree with
this since it implies Brahman/Atman has a desire for something.

Thanks, Mahesh
