As you can see, my comment was in continuation of Vidyasankarji's wherein he
said that *free* be dropped from free will. So clearly the will to do
anything isn't free, in my perspective, ergo, it may have a cause. In
effect, what I'm saying is pUrva saMskAra resulted in the karma phala of
willingness to do a particular thing (in a particular way).

I haven't read Tilak, so I wouldn't know if he meant the causeless cause as
Brahman directly or indirectly as in Brahman being the basis for everything.
Just a thought.
