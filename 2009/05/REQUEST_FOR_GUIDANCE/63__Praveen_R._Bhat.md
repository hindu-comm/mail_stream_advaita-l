Thats a very interesting point about having will but not as free as one
thinks it to be. IMHO, even the icchA to do something is purva karmA driven,
meaning the person's willingness to do one thing more than another itself
comes from purva saMskAra. Unfortunately, mortals have a focus of a singular
life, that too restricted by memory, to see where this purva saMskAra comes
from.
