Hi!

I would like to point out that Sri Gnanananda Niketan has published the printedSri Vidyaranya's Panchadashi (with Sanskrit Text and Tamil Translation only) in two volumes. The total cost is somewhere around Rs 850 (Rs eight hundred and fifty only). The cost is quite high, but I have purchased one set for myself in 2008. 

Sri Gnanananda Niketan, Tapovanam, P.O. 605 756 Villupuram, R.P. District, 
Tamil Nadu, India Tel. Number 00-91-4153-24938 
e-mail Address info at gnanananda-niketan.org 
Web URL http://www.gnanananda-niketan.org

If you are looking for Hindi or English translations, I would like to suggest that you look forof Chinmaya Misssion, Mumbai's Swami Anubhavananda's commentary,or the Randheer Prakashan and Chowkambha Series or Motilal Banarsidas of Uttar Pradesh.
