Pranams!

It give me great pleasure to inform you that the 84th Indian Philosophical
Congress is to be held in Mumbai from Oct 24-29 2009. The Congress was
established in 1925 by the Nobel Laureate RabindraNath Tagore & Dr S
Radhakrishnan. Each year, it is held in a different Indian city & is coming
to Mumbai after a period of 5 decades. It is being hosted by the Department
of Philosophy, University of Mumbai & sponsored in part by IPC & ICPR. We
hope many of the scholars of this forum would consider presenting papers or
attending the Congress. The details can be found at:

Thanks, Mahesh
