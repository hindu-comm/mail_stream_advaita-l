PraNams to all

First I am not sure why I did not see my post directly other than referenced by Shree Maheshji and then by others although it was there in the archives list. The same problem I had with my previous post too. 

Anyway - Shree Maheshji - I give importance to only the texts - Upadesha saara and Sad darshaNam of Bhagavaan Ramana since most of other talks are conversations and the answers more relevant to the questioner than for general audience. Those are custom made depending on the student who is asking the question and his background. While the books are for the audience at large. The talks have to be understood from the contextual point. This is only my opinion.


The point that was made by Bhagavan Ramana in the sloka is that free will is there to deal with the situation that one is facing and the situation that one is facing is due to past actions. Hence what I have is destiny, and what I do with what I have is purushaartha. This is the beginning-less cycle. Both arise due to ignorance which is anaadi. These go together only because there is katRitva bhaava that is  I am kartaa notion is there. That is only a notion, and therefore both what I have and what I do with what I have, both are result of the basic notion that I am a doer. That very conclusion is the essence of the problem and arises due to lack of substantive knowledge that - akartaaham abhoktaaham, ahamevaaham avyayaH. I am never a doer or enjoyer.  

The rest of the discussion is not much relevant to me.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
