Dear Maheshji,

You have asked a pertinent question, which I think Adi Sankaracharya replied to long ago. The self-realised, who is yet to become Videhamukta, doact and is a living person but the quality of hisaction is Sattvic and not in individual-self-interest. If you turn the heater off do the coils cool down instantly? Did not Lord Buddha talk after his awakening? Did not Lord Krishna Himself talk? 

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Pranams Sadananda-ji!

I am in agreement with your position that a Master answers an individual's
questions are based on the individual's spiritual development. It is fairly
well know that the Buddha, on being asked if God existed, by two different
persons, replied Yes to the first and No to the second.

However, that does not mean that I abandon my position, the reason for which
is given in another thread. And on a less important note, one does not know
how advanced the below disciple was & so one can't discount the answer
completely.

I would like to pose one more question to you which may appear to veer away
from the original topic but then maybe not: You write:

>> I am never a doer or enjoyer.

In the case of a self-realized person, who is the doer? When I see him or
her act in the world - who is it who walks, talks, sleeps, laughs? Who is
that who answers the question put by the disciple?

Thanks, Mahesh
