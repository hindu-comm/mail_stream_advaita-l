Only a couple of clarifications from my end - prakRti, strictly speaking,
represents only the insentient. 

Individual 'free will' is an illusion on the same level as the notion of the
'individual' itself. So long as there is a you vs. me in my mind, there is
an 'individual' I and this 'I' has both destiny and will. So individual action
is not a myth in and of itself; it is dependent upon the notion of the
individual.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
