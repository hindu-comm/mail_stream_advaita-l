N S Jayaram

Dear one and all,

My name is N S Jayaram. I am a 27 years old marine engineer
living in Chennai. I am blessed with a daughter recently. I am interested in
Shankara Bhagaavatphada's Advaita sidhantham. The monthly
magazine,"TATVALOKA" has been instrumental in building my interest in this
subject. I wish to enhance my knowledge about self. I hope the enrollment
will help me achieve what I intend to. All the very best to you for all your
endeavours. Take care and wishing you all a cheerful and healthy life.
Yours sincerely,
N S Jayaram
