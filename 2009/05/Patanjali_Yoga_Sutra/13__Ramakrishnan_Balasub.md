This is indeed the "traditional" viewpoint. It is also made very clear
by Sankara that he concentrates on the *differences* between
sankhya/yoga and vedaanta since there was a tendency to confuse these
even in his time. The point is - yes there are similarities - but
there are some fundamental differences. This is brought out clearly by
Sri Subbramayya - schooled by real advaitin masters such as
Mahaasannidhanam in his two volume book on the Dakshinamurti stotram.

The problem is that we see some random stuff coming from people, and
certain other people jumping on it and attributing it to the
"traditional" advaita - all the while blissfully unaware of the source
texts from Vidyaranya or Citsukha which already have made these
crystal clear. "Imagine a dead horse and flog it to death" is the way
I would put it.

In any case even if Gaudapada did write the work on Sankhya-karikas,
it does not mean much. After all Vacaspati Mishra - the advaitin - was
a sarva-tantra-svatantra who wrote authoritatively on all darshanas of
importance.
