That is why Sankhya at its level of discussion does not bring in the concept of Brahman. It does not talk of Ishvara simply because it is not in the scope of Sankhya at the level of its discussion. Tell me where did Sankhya say that there is no Brahman? Sankhya never denied Ishvara. At that level of discussion it just does not tell you about Ishvara. At a higher level of discussion Lord Krishna does tell us that Sankhya and Yoga are one. Lord Krishna later on takes us to Vedanta. Svetasvatara Upanishad is basically an advanced Sankhya text and it clearly says that the concept of Brahman is given only to the most advanced students of Sankhya. The past stalwarts and great Advaitins like Gaudapadacharya

Please read the brahma-sUtra-bhAshya where it is clear that Sankara
refutes Sankhya and yoga. It does not matter what your perception of
these are, but as per Sankara there are problems with both.

?!!! The tradition of commentaries and sub-commentaries, and
commentaries on those are quite common. The bottomline ios the subject
matter can be quite deep and can call for more commentaries. I am not
sure what you are trying to say.

> Do you also mean to say that Gaudapada, who wrote a bhashya on the Sankhyakarika was a proponent of a different type of Advaita philosophy? And do you place the scholarship of Gaudapadacharya below that of Vacaspati Misra?

?!! All that meant was he could write a bhAshya on something without
necessarily agreeing with it.
