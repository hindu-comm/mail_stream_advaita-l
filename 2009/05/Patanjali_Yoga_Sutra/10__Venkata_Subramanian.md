Well of course i dont know whether i can still mention about Holenarsipur Sri Sachidanandendra Saraswathi Swamigal here. In his Gita Shastrarta Viveka he has shown nicely how the Sankya of the Gita is Vaidika....

Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.

There are only some minor terminological differences. For example the word Tanmatra is not used by all the texts. 

the Samkhyakarikas are atheistic. The Bhagavadgita is most assuredly not.. That's more than a difference in terminology!
