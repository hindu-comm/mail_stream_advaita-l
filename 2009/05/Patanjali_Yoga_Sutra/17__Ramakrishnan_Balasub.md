Sankhya as it stands is a lower level text than the Vedanta and was criticised by Vedantin. Sankhya has been treated holistically by Svetasvatara upanishad and that does not call for refutation. Sankhya combined with Yoga and with subsequent treatment of Brahman, as treatedholistically by Lord Krishna,also doesnot invite refutation from Advaitin. To my knowledge Adi Sankaracharya did not criticize the Svetasvatara Upanishadnor the teaching of the Bhagavad Gita.

And how do you know that I have not read the Sankhya Karikas? As a
matter of fact, I have - many times - along with Vacaspatis
taattvakamudI.

Radhakrishnan found it to be a matter of concern.It could alsobe that the verse was not deleted at the time of Adi Sankaracharya. TheBrahmasutrabhashya itself says that the views are not of Badarayana alone andfurther as regardsthe Bhashya how are you absolutely certain thatwhat we have todaywas written by Adi Sankaracharya and nobody has added anything to it or deleted anything from it.

For any list members who found my statement about bhAshyas difficult
to understand, please consider the case of Vacaspati who wrote
excellent bhAshyas on all topics such as nyAya, sAnkhya, yoga, pUrva
mImA.msA and vedAnta. His tAtparyaTIkA is considered as an authority
by later nyAya writers, just as his bhAmatI is by vedAntins. Hopefully
it is clear that these two are distinct schools. Unless he was
suffering from an acute case of schizophrenia he couldn't be an
adherent of all these schools. Why - even today in Sringeri eminent
vidvAns and the jagadguru himself participate in discussions/sadas
assuming the viewpoint of nyAya sometimes advancing novel solutions to
problems. If you didn't know better, you would think everyone there
was a naiyAyika.

In any case, I don't think it's profitable to participate further in
any discussion where Radhakrishnan, of all people, is quoted as an
"authority" on advaita.
