Please read the brahma-sUtra-bhAshya where it is clear that Sankara
refutes Sankhya and yoga. It does not matter what your perception of
these are, but as per Sankara there are problems with both.

Your comments are hasty. If you have read my letter properly you would haverealized that Sankhyakarika, if takenas a completestatement of Sankhya, calls for refutation. Sankhya as it stands is a lower level text than the Vedanta and was criticised by Vedantin. Sankhya has been treated holistically by Svetasvatara upanishad and that does not call for refutation. Sankhya combined with Yoga and with subsequent treatment of Brahman, as treatedholistically by Lord Krishna,also doesnot invite refutation from Advaitin. To my knowledge Adi Sankaracharya did not criticize the Svetasvatara Upanishadnor the teaching of the Bhagavad Gita. 

Itis perfectly alright if youdo not have time and inclination toread that Sankhyakarikacould have lost a verse but people like Dr. S. Radhakrishnan found it to be a matter of concern.It could alsobe that the verse was not deleted at the time of Adi Sankaracharya. TheBrahmasutrabhashya itself says that the views are not of Badarayana alone andfurther as regardsthe Bhashya how are you absolutely certain thatwhat we have todaywas written by Adi Sankaracharya and nobody has added anything to it or deleted anything from it.

Please also tell us when and from which last writer, according to you, that the traditional writing ended, so that all the subsequent writings can be relegated to non- traditional category or rather uncalled for. This statement willbe certainly stop any new discussion.

All that meant was he could write a bhAshya on something without
necessarily agreeing with it.

That is why Sankhya at its level of discussion does not bring in the concept of Brahman. It does not talk of Ishvara simply because it is not in the scope of Sankhya at the level of its discussion. Tell me where did Sankhya say that there is no Brahman? Sankhya never denied Ishvara. At that level of discussion it just does not tell you about Ishvara. At a higher level of discussion Lord Krishna does tell us that Sankhya and Yoga are one. Lord Krishna later on takes us to Vedanta. Svetasvatara Upanishad is basically an advanced Sankhya text and it clearly says that the concept of Brahman is given only to the most advanced students of Sankhya. The past stalwarts and great Advaitins like Gaudapadacharya

?!!! The tradition of commentaries and sub-commentaries, and
commentaries on those are quite common. The bottomline ios the subject
matter can be quite deep and can call for more commentaries. I am not
sure what you are trying to say.

> Do you also mean to say that Gaudapada, who wrote a bhashya on the Sankhyakarika was a proponent of a different type of Advaita philosophy? And do you place the scholarship of Gaudapadacharya below that of Vacaspati Misra?
