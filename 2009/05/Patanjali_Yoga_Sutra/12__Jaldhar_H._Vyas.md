Insofar as we discourage anything it is certain _topics_ which have been 
shown in the past to provide more heat than light.  But certainly not 
_people_ especially ones of the calibre of Swami Sachiddanandendra.

What would be interesting is a comparison of Sankhya in the Gita to 
Sankhya in the karikas.  It seems to me that although similiar vocabulary 
is used, the philosophical implications are considerably different.

One more thing.  Yes there is a commentary on Sankhyakarikas attributed to 
Gaudapada but it is an open question whether it is the same person as the 
Vedantic acharya.
