Yoga with Vivekakhyati (knowledge of Sankhya) helps one to anchor the Soul to Ishvara andPatanjali says that Om (Brahman)is the verbal representation of Ishvara. Yoga with the the concept of Advaita Vedanta alone can helps one torealise that the Soul is not different from Brahman. Yoga is essential in Dvaita as well as in Advaita.

Then use the terms seshvara and nirIshvara if you like. The fact is the classical Samkhya position on this topic is atheistic enough that the brahmasutras repeatedly criticize it and reject it as authoritative. See I-4 upto 2.1.2. 2.1.3 also says the criticism applies mutatis mutandis to yoga even though it does have an Ishvara concept.

Again as we have discussed previously Samkhya/Yoga have undergone a vedantic reinterpretation and it is the vedantized versions that we are familiar with today. But this just goes to prove my point that all instances of the words "samkhya" and "yoga" do not refer to the same thing.
