I actually did complete the translation but for some reason did not post 
it to the list.

According to Shri Bhaskararaya, these 3 stotras are to be recited after
the Devi Mahatmya.  They have no relation to the vishishtadvaita concept
of rahasya traya.

First you should recite the following:

asya shrIrahasyatrayasya brahmA.achyutarudrA R^iShayaH | navadurgA devatA |
anuShTup.h chhandaH | mahAlakShmIbIjaM | shrIH shaktiH |
abhIpsitaphalasiddhyarthe jape viniyogaH ||

"Of these three rahasyas, Brahma, Achyuta[1], and Rudra[2] are the 
Rishis; The Nine Durgas are the devatas;  Anushtup is the meter; 
Mahalakshmi is the seed;  Shri is the power; That all wishes may be 
fulfilled is the purpose."

[1] i.e. Vishnu.

[2] i.e. Shiva.
