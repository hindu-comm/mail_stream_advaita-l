Before the rahasyas we say either the vedokta or tantrokta devisukta 
(usually the latter) then after them the navarna etc. you mentioned and 
finally Siddhakunjika stotra.  I'll post a translation of that one soon.

As far as I know it is not required to say them quietly.  The recitation 
as a whole should be done in a steady, even voice.

The rahasyas are part of the Markandeya Mahapurana just like the Devi 
Mahatmya itself.  Thus they are "public".  Diksha is not needed to say 
them in a normal reading.  There is a form called sampuTa PaTha 
where each mantra of the saptashati is preceded and followed by another 
mantra of various types for various siddhis.  One needs diksha from a 
Sadguru for that.
