The Manusmriti says, "streenAm upanayana-sthAnE vivAham manurabraveet".  In
the case of women marriage is performed in place of upanayanam.  Upanayanam
earns a man a Guru while vivaaham earns a girl her Guru (her husband).

When we have doubts we approach our AachaaryaaL for clarification.  Kanchi
AachaaryaaL had clearly said that women should not chant Gayathri Manthra.

What is yagnopaveetham without Gayathri manthra?

Gayathri itself is femine and is considered the mother of the Veda.  When a
boy is initiated during the yagnopaveetham the mother is present and hears
the Gayathri upadesam given to her son and she receives the first
'abhivaadhaye' from him.  No upanayanam is possible without the mother being
present.

It is pertinent to quote the advise of Kanchi Mahaswami when someone who was
not initiated into Gayathri asked him if he can chant Gayathri.  I give
below the incident that was published.

Paramacharya and Children: Baby--Lily--Billy
author:..... SriMaTham Balu
compiler:... T.S. Kothandarama Sarma

Baby--Lily--Billy

A veLLALa (farmer) devotee asked, "Can I chant the Gayatri Mantra?"

A question that creates dharma saN^katam (embarrassment to do what is
right)! Either of the two replies yes or no is bound to bring up criticism.

SriMaTham's work is to foster and preserve the Sanatana dharmas. The
confrontations that Bharat had in the last thousand years are numerous. The
Bharata samudAya (public) has always had the skills to preserve its roots,
withstanding the attacks, bending like reeds when a hurricane blows and then
raising its head once again after storm passes.

But then should SriMaTham intervene in every change? What is its share?
Today's thinking becomes obsolete tomorrow and cast away. Though no one can
control the gush of floods after it broke the dam, a day has to come when
the floods will recede and the flow is streamlined in the river?

Nobody has any knowledge if PeriyavaaL had such thoughts. But he had the
unique ability to ease a delicate situation and leave it to its natural
course.

PeiyavaaL did not give a direct reply to the devotee. "How many children you
have?" he asked.

A surprising reply came from him. "By your grace I have been bestowed with
three girls: one five years old, another three and the last six months..."

Periyavaa said: "Name one girl as Gayatri, another as Sandhya and the third
as Savitri. Call the three girls by those names. Not as Baby--Lily--Billy!

"If you thus repeatedly say the names Gayatri--Sandhya--Savitri, you would
get the puNyA (fruits) of Gayatri Mantra chanting."

The devotees face displayed his happiness. Periyavaa had given him his
anugraha of clarity of thought, when he was hesitating to take up an act
that was against the sampradAya (tradition).
