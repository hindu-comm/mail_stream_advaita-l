I heard that both involved animal sacrifices, which is prohibited by the
laws enacted by the Indian government. Under these circumstances, they had
do it with reasonable secrecy. I was told that when you buy a goat for a
sacrifice its price is often doubled for the same reason. Somehow it is OK
in India to kill a goat or cow to eat, but not for a vedic sacrifice.
