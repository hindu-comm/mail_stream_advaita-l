The Sruti itself says the sacrifice is symbolic. The "other" evidence - the Smriti, for instance the Mahabharata, clearly does not permit human sacrifice.

Commentaries on Sruti and Smriti do not have the same authority as the scriptural texts themselves. Moreover, Sishtachara also says that the sacrifice is symbolic.

Interestingly, the wikipedia article on Purushamedha now reads:

The ritual in many aspects resembles that of the Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice), with, according to Griffith (1899)

  man, the noblest victim, being actually or symbolically sacrificed instead of the Horse, and men and women of various tribes, figures, complexions, characters, and professions being attached to the sacrificial stakes in place of the tame and wild animals enumerated in Book XXIV [VS 24]. These nominal victims were afterwards released uninjured, and, so far as the text of the White Yajurveda goes, the whole ceremony was merely emblematical.

The ceremony evokes the primordial mythical sacrifice of Purusha, the "Cosmic Man", and the officiating Brahman recites the Purusha sukta (RV 10.90 = AVS 5.19.6 = VS 31.1â€“16).

Note that Griffith acknowledges that the "so far as the text of the White Yajurveda goes, the whole ceremony was merely EMBLEMATICAL".

The "other" evidence CAN be set aside due to the higher authorities of Sruti and Smriti.

You still haven't answered my question though! :)

The burden of proof is on you to show that these specific passages are from "later interpolations". The story of Jarasandha occurs in all the available scripts on the Mahabharata (from the second book of "Sabha Parva"), and there is no reason to suppose that it is anything but genuine.

An example of burden of proof: there have been controversial recipients of the Nobel prize in the past. But to claim that "This particular Nobel laureate is not a fair recipient because of past Nobel controversies" is not valid - the person who makes the claim bears the burden of proof to show why this particular Nobel laureate is not a fair recipient of the prize.

Really? How then do you know that it actually happened? Obviously, there had to be eye-witnesses to the event who testified to its occurrence!

None of what you've said above proves that the performers of these sacrifices tried to hide their sacrifice from the society. They may have chosen a place away from the general living areas because they wouldn't want to be disturbed during the sacrifice.

See above.

For dharmic reasons, a woman may take a bath where she may not been seen by other persons. However, before taking the bath, she may well announce that she is going to do so, and afterwards too, she can certainly say that she has completed her bath. Although the exact details of how the woman takes her bath is outside the vision of others, there is no reason to hide the occurrence of the action (i.e. bath) itself.
