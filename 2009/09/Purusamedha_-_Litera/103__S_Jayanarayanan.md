There are many conclusions that can be drawn in the above instance. The story may serve to underline the point that human sacrifices are NOT being intended, so "be careful not to misconstrue these injunctions".

Think again!

Krishna says:

  manuShyANA.n samAlambho na cha dR^iShTaH kadA chana . 

  "The sacrifice of men is not seen anywhere."

IF human sacrifice as enjoined by the Vedic texts actually occurred as you claim, WHY is it that Krishna says that NO human sacrifice OF ANY KIND (including those that are supposedly enjoined by the Veda) can be seen during that time?

The word "dR^iShTaH" is important - it indicates that such sacrifice MAY have occurred in a hidden place such as a jungle or a cave outside the eye of the society, but that it was not practised among those who have nothing to hide in their actions that conform to dharma.

In fact, those who deal with the society in a dharmic way NEVER have anything to hide from anyone!

Regards,
Kartik
