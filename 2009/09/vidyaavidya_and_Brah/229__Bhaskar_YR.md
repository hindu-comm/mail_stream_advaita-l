This has already been explained starting from Adi
shankara and the succesive disciples and commentators on how vidya and
avidya can coexist in Brahman.There is copious material on how the jiva
can acquire avidya and how avidya can exist on Brahman.

praNAms Sri Srikanta prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I am not able to get this !!!  Could you please elaborate this?? How can 
nitya shuddha, buddha, mukta Atman/brahman can have the  dual existence of 
both vidya & avidya??  neha nAnAsti kiMchana is the shruti declaration and 
I dont see anywhere shruti saying vidya & avidyA can co-exist in 
brahman!!??

thanks for your clarification in advance.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
