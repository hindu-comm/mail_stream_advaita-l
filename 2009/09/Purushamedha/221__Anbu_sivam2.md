Our Vedas and Puranas and Ithihasas talk of so many characters who you can
come across in every day life.  How many of the members of this forum alone
have not come across a character such as a Jambavan (who enthused you to
succeed) or a Salya (who decried your efforts every step of the way)?
Sunakshepa is a character who was willing to die.  If you come across a
person who self-immolates as it happens in India (!) you know there is a
Sunakshepa!  Gandhi was a Sunakshepa and he advocated losing oneself for a
cause that is of no personal benefit to himself let alone for anyone else.
For him the MEANS is sacred NOT THE END CAUSE OR RESULT.  He delightedly
showed his other cheek to a white man who slapped him.  *Appease but never
fight  was his path*.  He believed that in the goodness of the enemy that he
might let you live but if he didn't it is OK!! I have come across a lot of
people who thought it was great that Gandhi showed his other cheek but never
practiced it themselves!  My father was averse to that fake struggle called
Sathyagraha that ended unceremoniously when the British decided to quit
after dividing the country that let to the blood flowing like the rivers
Sindhu and the Ganga in Panjab and Bengal.  The author of the sathyagraha
wasn't willing to claim victory after the division and bloodbath.  A Hindu
cursed him for the setback and took him out in despair.   The Congress party
portrayed Gandhi as a martyr and made political gains for its secular
objectives and for those of Muslims and Christians to convert and flourish
in the Hindu India.  And sathyagraha was given the credit for the so called
independence. (sic!)  Ever since then we only see this govt appeasing the
Muslims and Christians at the expense of the Hindus.  It appeased Pakistan
and China with territories and never felt it sacred to fight for its return.

I agree with Jaldharji on his disapproval of Purusamedha which is taking out
one's life for another's gain.  But to that I simply add disapproval for
characters like Sunakshepa who is devoid of any principle of value except
being a loser.  I sometimes think that Viswamithra after adopting Sunakshepa
would have turned him into a man of some loftly principle worth emulating
for others in standing up for himself!
