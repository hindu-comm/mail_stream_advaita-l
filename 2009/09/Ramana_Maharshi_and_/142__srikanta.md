With reference to the above discussion,Adwaitins consider that Ramana is
the practical example in recent times,who was a Jivanmukta.His famous
statement"Find out who you are",is a page out of the Upanishads.The
Upanishads also explore to the root of the question "Who am I"?The
Upanishad answers,"Aham Brahmasmi".Later the Adwatik Pundits might have
corroborated his statements with what are in the scriptures,and what
Sri.Shankara has written,but,the example of Ramana is the original example
of a Jnani and a Jivanmukta.
