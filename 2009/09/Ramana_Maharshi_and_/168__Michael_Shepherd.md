A correction, with apologies to Sadaji: the website is www.advaitaforum.org
for these videos.

Subject: Ramana Maharshi and Advaita Vedanta


I asked a question recently about how members here see the relationship
between Ramana Maharshi and his method of vichara and Advaita Vedanta.

I'd just like to note here that I have gained  a very full answer to this
from Sri Kuntimaddi Sadananda's series of videos on this subject, on the
Chinmaya Mission website, which I strongly recommend. He takes the texts he
expounds on from Ramanaji's 'Forty Verses', the Sad Darshanam.
