I apologise for asking questions which may have been well chewed over
previously.. You can always refer me back to the archives..

I'm interested to know how the pandits here view Ramana Maharshi in relation
to Advaita Vedanta.

It's said that Ramana achieved enlightenment 'on his own' (+karma) but
later, when visitors intruded on his silent sannyasa with questions about
Advaita Vedanta, taught himself Sanskrita and read Shankara, and declared
himself entirely at one with Shankara..

i have my own views as to the relation of Ramana with Advaita Vedanta in
practice. But I'd like to hear the views of others on the essential nature
of the relationship -- if they see one..

Michael
