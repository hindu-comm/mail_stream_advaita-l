Dear Sunil ji,

I am in complete agreement with Jaldhar ji's definition. The only problem
was with 'mithya=false.' It is a petty problem (as I expressed earlier.)
I am not convinced with the word "impermanence" also for "mithya." jagat and
brahma define ONE entity. jagat IS brahma. As jagat it IS brahma but is not
known as brahma (this is *mithyatva*). As brahma it is brahma and is known
as brahma. As jagat and as brahma it IS (hence not impermanent.) Thus
"mithya"=/="false". It is just unrealized-ness.
