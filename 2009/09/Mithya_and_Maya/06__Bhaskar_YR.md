*jagat* is *mithya*, but *nityam*

praNAms
Hare Krishna

IMHO, we cannot postulate nityatvaM to mithyatva of jagat...nityaM is 
THAT, one without second (ekaMevAdviteeyaM)...If we say mithya jagat  is 
nityaM then  it is as good as saying either  there are two parallel 
nitya-s i.e. parabrahma and mithya jagat  OR in THAT secondless nityatvaM 
of parabrahman  'mitya jagat' also has an eternal existence. (Then on may 
ask,  how can an avyAkruta prakruti has the originates as vyAkruta jagat 
without any base??  this is a different issue altogether).    I dont think 
shankara anywhere says mithya jagat is nityaM...OTOH, he says this 
mithya/mAya/prakruti is 'tattvAnyatvAbhyAm anirvachaneeya' by giving the 
illustration of foam and water.  Ofcourse nobody would agree mithya snake 
(jagat) superimposed on rope (brahman) is nitya...it has an end after the 
dawn of Atma jnAna.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
