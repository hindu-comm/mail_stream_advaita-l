I guess you could be really pedantic, and say, that when knowledge of
Brahman dawns, mithya dissolves; but maya as prakrti acting in the three
gunaa, continues while prakrti continues... while atmabrahma views it with
indifference !

Maya is itself mithya, because it is found to be non-existent when
knowledge
of Brahman dawns.

praNAms Sri Sastri prabhuji
Hare Krishna

But in geeta commentary itself shankara hints about the 'pariNAmi
nityatva' to the mAya as against 'kUtastha nityatva' of parabrahman is it
not??  shankara calls mAya as achala & dhruva in geeta bhAshya.yasmAt
achalam tasmAt dhruvaM nityaM ityarthaH, clarifies shankara.  Hence, in
vyAvahArika sence we can say mAya is pariNAmi nitya, thus mAya cannot be
categorized as mithya atleast from the srushti & vyavahArika point of
view. Atleast for the srushti  kriya we have to accept the pariNAmi
nityatva of mAya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
