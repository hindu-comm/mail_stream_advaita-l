You can look at it from this angle. Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that He created this world from a part of His. That way all creation is Brahman and this Jagat is Brahman if we realise the truth. This means when weattain Brahmajnana everything is Brahman. Khalvidam Brahma. But as long as we do not see through Maya we cannot see the unity or oneness. These concepts were never sorted out in the ancient past through exchange of written notes. The Guru used to clarify the doubts of the disceples sitting in front of them . If one word or sentence confuses the disciples that could be sorted out then and there. If the great Adi sankara could haveimagined that there would be such a great controversy over the word "Mithya" then he would have certainly written another treatise entirely explaining what he meant by the word "Mithya". But probably hehoped that we would be intelligent enough to understand what he meant.

Quote: "We can aver that the jagat is 'not false' only from the point of
view of the
perception of the senses, indriyas."

What Bharadwajji is highliting is something like this:
Actually Indriyas are part of the jagat! Now tell me: are the indriyas
mithya too or not?

Mithya should be understood as 'there is nothing in it'. In English we use
the term 'unreal' or 'false'.
Thus indeed such terms as ephemeral, transcient etc are the characteristics
of jagat that is finally concluded as mithya. Once you understand mithya
then all these 'something' about nothing becomes irrelevant!

Brahman on the contrary is Sathyam. There *is* something and that something
is actually full!

Thus 'Brahma Sathyam, Jagan mithya' could be understood.
