Maya is itself mithya, because it is found to be non-existent when 
knowledge
of Brahman dawns.

praNAms Sri Sastri prabhuji
Hare Krishna

But in geeta commentary itself shankara hints about the 'pariNAmi 
nityatva' to the mAya as against 'kUtastha nityatva' of parabrahman is it 
not??  shankara calls mAya as achala & dhruva in geeta bhAshya.yasmAt 
achalam tasmAt dhruvaM nityaM ityarthaH, clarifies shankara.  Hence, in 
vyAvahArika sence we can say mAya is pariNAmi nitya, thus mAya cannot be 
categorized as mithya atleast from the srushti & vyavahArika point of 
view. Atleast for the srushti  kriya we have to accept the pariNAmi 
nityatva of mAya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
