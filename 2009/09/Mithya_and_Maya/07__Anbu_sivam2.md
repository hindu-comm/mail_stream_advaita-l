Quote: "We can aver that the jagat is 'not false' only from the point of
view of the
perception of the senses, indriyas."

What Bharadwajji is highliting is something like this:
Actually Indriyas are part of the jagat!  Now tell me: are the indriyas
mithya too or not?

Mithya should be understood as 'there is nothing in it'.  In English we use
the term 'unreal' or 'false'.
Thus indeed such terms as ephemeral, transcient etc are the characteristics
of jagat that is finally concluded as mithya.  Once you understand mithya
then all these 'something' about nothing becomes irrelevant!

Brahman on the contrary is Sathyam.  There *is* something and that something
is actually full!

Thus 'Brahma Sathyam, Jagan mithya' could be understood.
