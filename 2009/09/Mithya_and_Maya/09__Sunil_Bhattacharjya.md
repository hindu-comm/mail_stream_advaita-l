The word for "Transient" is "Anitya" and not "Mithya". I think Jaldharji has given a good definiion, as ony a jnani really realises that the world in anitya whereas the others may talk about it as anitya but their actions do not show that they have realised the impermanency of the Jagat.

Dear Sri Jaldhar,

The word *mithya* doesn't mean "false." It means "transient", not constant,
not permanent, not lasting (naSvaram = bound to perish), and
not-independent. Jagat is leela.
In contrast brahma is satyam. It is not-transient. It is independent,
Sudhdham and nityam.

This is Sankara's view behind using the word "*mithya*" rather than "*
asatyam*" or some other word to mean "false."
