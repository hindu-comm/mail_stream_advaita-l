Sri Srikanta,

I don't wish to argue with you, but I have a feeling that we invest too much
'power' to Maya as some anti-brahman.. That would put it outside Brahman,
which can't be right-- it savours of Abrahamic gods and devils  (dualities
?)

If we accept the description of some sages that maya is 'the limiting
measures' of Brahman, then ajna and jivanmukta's senses are equally
effective; they 'observe' the same objects, but ajna's mind is limited by
avarana and vikshepa.

I hope this doesn't seem like some word-play : it suggests that maya is
simply a limit --perhaps a necessary measure on the jiva ? -- with no
'power' of its own. I used to fear maya as a 'power'; now I see it as merely
a deficiency of mind (not of senses) to be 'made good'. Does that make sense
?

Michael

With reference to Sri.Sunil Bhattacharyaji,s Email that  there is a
difference between what Jivanmukta and the others see and that the
Jivanmukta realises that it is Maya,it is said in Gaudapadakarikas that
"sa ca Maya na vidyate".For the realised one, the Maya doesnot exist.The
very nature of Maya is it is "anirvacaniya",the inexplicable.Maya is the
power that veils Brahman,the reality.It has both avarana and viksepa
powers.The Jivanmukta can act in this world,but for him he sees only the
reality everywhere.But,for the ajna,the reality is veiled by Maya,and he
too sees and believes it as reality,but he is deluded.
                                                        N.Srikanta.
