Dear list members,

I am interested in knowing the etymology and meanings/significance of the
word "SAradA", specifically with respect to
SrI SAradAmba in Sringeri. The dictionary meaning given in Monier Williams
was not very enlightening in this regard,
hence the question. I would be grateful if any references to the
purANas/itihAsAs regarding the usage of this word are
also given.

Thanking you,

Regards,
Shyam
