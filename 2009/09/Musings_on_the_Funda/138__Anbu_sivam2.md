*Aum

FOURTH MUSING*

The following is Vedic proof of the Para Brahman indicated by the letter OM.
The proof uses the method called Swaroopa Lakshana ie questioning the nature
of each and extracting its essence.

The Veda says:
“ Eshaam Bhoothaanaam Prithvi rasaha.”

What is the essence of all objects?

Earth is the essence of all objects. Whether you talk of Nuclear physics or
astronomy or micro biology or even poetry you talk of objects that are all
centered on earth. Therefore earth is the essence of all objects.

The next question is: what is the essence of earth?

It is the water. Astronomers scan the sky for world with water out there
because nothing can be called the world if it has no water. Therefore water
is the essence of earth.

“Prithivya Apo rasaha.”

The next question is: What is the essence of water?

It is the vegetation that water gives rise to.

“Aapomoshadhayo rasaha.”

What is the essence of vegetation?
Of the herbs which give rise to food, the human body is the essence because
the human body is made of food only (Annamaya kosa).

“Oshadheenaam purusho rasaha.”

What is the essence of human body?

Let’s investigate this a little bit. Let us say there are 10 guys out there.
And who among them would you pay attention to? You would pay attention to a
guy who would say something even if it be calling your attention like “Sir”.
Therefore, of the human body the organ of speech called Vaak is the essence.

“ Purushasya vaag rasaha.”

Now there are 10 guys out there, all saying something. Who would you pay
attention to?

You would pay attention to the one who is knowledgeable, one who is a
vidwaan and ignore others. Therefore it is the Veda composed of Riks that is
the essence of Vaak or speech.

“Vaacha rg rasaha.”

Among the vidwaans, or among the Vedas which is the essence?

Among the vidwaans you pay attention to the one who would convey to you in a
congenial manner, the most congenial of all is the music. That which is
music to the ears is Saaman. That is why it is “Naadhabramha mayi Vidya”.
Vidya covers the entire sum total of all worldly knowledge, the knowledge
that covers both the world and its controller. This is Hreemkaaraswaroopam.
“Hreem” indicates space, time and causality which in turn indicate Brahma,
Vishnu and Rudhra who form the Trinity or the Universe. They know themselves
as the Universe and it is therefore the Vidya.

“Richaha Saama rasaha.”

The next question is: What is the essence of Saaman?

Utgitha is the essence of Saama. Ut means Aum. You might have seen many of
our elders start any writing with the letter U (the fifth Tamil vowel) on
top or at the beginning. This is indicative of Ut the singing of which is
called Utgitha. Saama Veda deals with Utgitha. Utgitha is the letter OM

“Saamna udgithO rasaha.”

This Utgitha is the essence of all essences, it is Supreme, and it is
competent for the highest place.

“Sa Esha Rasaanaagum Rasathamaha , Paramaha, Paraadhyaha – Yad Udgithaha.”

This is the way we negate each one, beginning with objects, to its essence
and finally arrive at the Supreme, the essence of all essences, the Brahman.

The Lesson therefore is:

Narayanaparovyakthaath. Narayana is beyond the unmanifest.
Andam Avyaktha sambhavam. This manifest world came from the Unmanifest.

And our Vedas declare: Brahmaivaapnodhi Param. The knower of Brahman attains
the Supreme!

Sri GurubyO Namaha
