You are right, there is nothing wrong in airing the views with independent outllok without getting attached to any of the sides, infact, only than you can have the glimpse of truth

See how quickly you came to a conclusion that I am not a Hindu! Any sane
person
reading Ramayana will have these genuine questions and doubts when some one
heaps all praise on one and give inconsistent explanations for dharma.

Sorry what I meant was "all the right wingers" who have slanted opinions.

Where did I say that? It is a discussion. and my point was every action is
relative and have
two sides, so dharma is not determined by one side alone was my point.
How many Hindus got killed in Mahabarath, right infront of Lord Krishna?
How many shatrias were killed by Parasurama? These does not bother you
because Hindus fighting hindus is ok. Your attachment is making you angry
about
my statements. Maya is shrouding what is real. Think through you will see
the truth.

I have strong interest in Advaita and believe in dharma, what I do not
tolerate is bigots hijacking the great Advaita for their own selfish motives
and define dharma as they please.
