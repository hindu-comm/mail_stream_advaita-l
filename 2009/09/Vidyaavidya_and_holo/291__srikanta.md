Sri Bhasker Prabhuji wrote on 29/9/2009 on the above topic.He asks "How
can vidya and avidya can coexist in Brahman?

This has been discussed in the "adhyasa Bhashya by Sri Shankara
Bhagawatpada.To a question how Brahman can support both,he says,Brahman
can support both in Adhyasa.Evidently,there is a greater dimension to
"Jnana",that is Brahma Jnana.In his commentary of
ishavasyopanishad,sri.shankara clearly distinguished vidya and avidya by
the statement that Vidya means Upasana and not Brahma Jnana.At the end of
his Bhashya Sri.shankara says that by Upasana one can reach the ishta
devata that is pratikopasana and not Jnana.In his commentary on the
mantra:"Vidyamsca avidyamsca yastadvedo ubhayam saha
        Avidyaya mrtyum titiva vidyaya amrtamasnute".

Further there is copious commentary by his disciples starting from
Sureshwara on wards down to Shankarananda and vidyaranya how Brahman can
support both.Infact,this has been the contention of Vishishtadwaitins
after Vimuktatman wrote his "ishtasiddhi".

As for Prabhuji's question whether Nrsimha purvatapaniya Upanishad and the
Nrsimha Uttaratapaniya Upanishads,these two upanishads are repetition of
the Mandukyopanishad.Gaudapada is said to be commentator of both the
Upanishads.
