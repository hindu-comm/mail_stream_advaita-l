NamO namah!

I have a question.  It may look silly, but none-the-less, I would like the knowledgeble ones to respond.

Although the Rsis were mantra-dhrastas and have identified Indra, Vayu, Agni, Vishnu etc. they did not name their progenies with the name of Devas.  It is much unlike the latter day generations practice of naming children with the Trinitys' names such as Sankara, Rama, Madhava etc.  What could be the possible reason?

Thanks and regards,

narayan
