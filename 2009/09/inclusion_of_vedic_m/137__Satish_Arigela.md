>Also the entire Shree Suktam, Durga Suktam, Devi Suktam etc. are used by Shri Vidya >upasakas, whose adhikara may differ from vedic-adhikaris.

AFAIK, these sUkta-s are used only by a shrIvidya upAsaka if he belongs to the first three varNa-s. These sUkta-s are like add-ons. They can be used by those with adhikAra but they are not required in shrIvidya.

>But certain vedic mantra portion are also attached to other stotras. For. eg. "Sarasija >nilaye, saroja haste" portion of Shree Suktam in Kanakadhara stotra composition of Sri >Sankara

As for the this one, I think the context, intention and application matter.

One can simply say namaH shankarAya(without svara-s that is..)just to mean I bow to shankara without treating it as part of rudraM and I dont think it violates anything.

You can also see rudraM in shloka format(or shloka-s which imitate rudraM you may say)probably authored by AchArya-s from those old pAshupata shaiva school. The shloka format is meant women and non-dvija males.

There must be an old posting by shrI Anand Hudli addressing this question. Maybe the archives can be looked at.

Regards
satish
