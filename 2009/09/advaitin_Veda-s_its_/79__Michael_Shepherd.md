Sunilji,

I would say that discussion is absolutely vital to realisation. Indeed it is
built into the very term 'advaita' -- that the Self is approached by 'not
being two'.

Shankara himself in his commentaries imagines himself into, and records,
the strongest role of 'Objector' for this very reason.

 That atman which is sought as 'the dearest' (Briha.) is present in all
discussion, as the witness as well as the aim ?

Websites aren't the easiest way of engaging in disciplined discussion -- but
we do our best !

Michael
