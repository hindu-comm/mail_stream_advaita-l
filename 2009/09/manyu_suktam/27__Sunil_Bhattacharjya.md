Dear Sriramji,

You have mentioned all the Suktas and I have a query on the Vishnu Sukta. Kindly permit me to digress a bit from the main thread. To my knowledge there is apractice among some of themeat-eaters for sanctifying meat by reciting a particular verse from the Vishnusukta, where Lord Vishnu is called Mrigendra (Lion) and sprinkling water at the same time on the raw meat. This is done so that the sanctified meat becomes fit for human consumption.Are you aware of any vedic sanction of that sort?.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear members
Manyu has a meaning anger.I have not come across any distinct suktham 
devoted to manyu like Srisuktham,Durga suktham,Nakshatra suktham,Narayana 
suktham,Pavamana Suktham,Bhu Suktham,Purusha Suktham,Vishnu Suktham,Neela 
Suktham,Baghya Suktham and Saraswathi Suktham to name a few.May be Manyu 
Suktham refers to Sri Rudram as in it we pray to Lord Shiva to leave His 
anger on us and bless us.R.Krishnamoorthy.
