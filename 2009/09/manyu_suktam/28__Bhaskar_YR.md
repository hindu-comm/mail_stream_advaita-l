No prabhuji, as you know, shatarudreeya or sri rudraM is taitireeya 
saMhita maNtra-s whereas manyu sUkta is R^ig veda sUkta starts with maNtra 
' yaste manyO vidhadvajrasAyaka' etc. At some places, after mahAnyAsa 
pArAyaNa, after reciting ghOsha shAnti, we chant this manyu sUkta before 
rudra prashna.
