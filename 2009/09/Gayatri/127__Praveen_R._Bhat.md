Hari Om, Sunil-ji,

Apologies for digging out an old post, I'm just catching up a bit.

To my understanding, the onus of vedAdhyAyana by the girl rests with
the father, before marriage of the daughter and post
marriage, it lies with the husband. From Jaldhar-ji's detailed
references about brahmacArinis doing vedAdhyAyana seems to be the
case wherein girls who decided to not marry and lost their father did
it on their own.

The Vaishyas could learn vedas in the Dwapara yuga. In Kaliyuga the rstrictions were further relaxed. Further even in the ancient times some discretions were also permitted as otherwise how could Sayakama, being a low-born have learnt the Vedas.

Going by general social order existing today, ignoring specifics, one
may have to conclude the other way around because we've
only seen upanayana as well as Veda saMskAra even among Brahmins
decline now, if not across yugas. :)

praNAms,
