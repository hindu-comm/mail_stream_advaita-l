Thanks to Michael, Anbu, Syam and all who replied to my question.

I agree that chanting and studying the Veda ( Jnana kanda and Karma 
Kanda) requires particular capabilities and not all can do it 
correctly. 

However, I have seen and heard of some women purohits in India and 
abroad and have seen women well versed in vedanta and scriptures. I am 
sure in the centuries to come, women will enter this field with 
enthusiasm. Note: In many families, women perform the home pooja to the 
deities installed in the family home. So with the appropriate training 
and nurturing of abilities some should be able to do this work 
professionally.



As far as Purushamedha (human sacrifice) is concerned I am sure this 
did take place in India many many years ago but is not done these days.

Thanks,

Vijaya Kambhampati.
