Dear friends,

I shall be thankful if any member can let me know (with some reference to the archive) as to if any discussion was held in the group in the past on Nrsimha-tapania Upanishad. Adi Sankaracharya as well as hisgrand preceptor Gaudapadacharya wrote commentaries on the Nrsimha-purvatapania and Nrsimha-uttaratapania respectively.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
