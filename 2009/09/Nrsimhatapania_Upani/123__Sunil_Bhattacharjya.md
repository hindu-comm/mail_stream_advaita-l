Namaste,

Many scholars think that Adi Sankaracharyamight not have written commentary on Svetaasvatara Upanishad but I have no such doubt about the Nrsimhatapania as, to my knowledge, this is mentioned in one ofhis Digvijayas.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

I shall be thankful if any member can let me know (with some reference to 
the archive) as to if any discussion was held in the group in the past on 
Nrsimha-tapania Upanishad. Adi Sankaracharya as well as his grand 
preceptor Gaudapadacharya wrote commentaries on the Nrsimha-purvatapania 
and Nrsimha-uttaratapania respectively.

AFAIK, commentaries on shvetAshvetara and nrusimhatapani upanishads though 
available in the name of shankarAchArya, traditionally not ascribed to Adi 
shankara who wrote bhAshya on principal dashOpanishads, vedAnta sUtra & 
geeta. Anyway, I shall wait for others reply.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
