Dear Advaita request list,

Sorry to go back to a few weeks ago. But there was a question 
regarding whether women should read the Vedas or not. 

I have been told by a source that the word 'STRI' can be split to SA + 
TRI  meaning one wedded to the three gunas. This could refer to one who 
is physically male or female.

So vedas can be read by one who is physically male or female so long 
as they have full consciousness of the play of the three gunas within 
them.

Thats what I feel is OK in todays world.

Also there have been instances of Sages teaching women the Vedas and 
of women being well versed in the Vedas.

Women brahmacharinis exist in may hindu organistations doing excellent 
work from a good understanding of the hindu religion.

Vijaya Kambhampati.
