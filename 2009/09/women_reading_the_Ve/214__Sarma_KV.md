Vijaya ji,


Are women prohibited from even listenning to and understanding a pravachan
of Vedanta? By Vedas do we mean Vedanta? ie. Is even listenning and
understanding the philosophy of the Upanishads is prohibited to them??

1. *vEda* and *vEdAnta* are not the same. *vEdAnta* is subset of the
*vEda*(their meaning, actually.) But, the non-
*vEdAntic* part of *vEda-artha* is ritualistic detail (and such things) and
so, it is not for meant for "common public." Some parts of the
*vEda-artha*(as is the
*vEda* itself) is 'accessible' to women, who are engaged in the rituals like
the *yajna*-s.
2. Among the general public (esp. women), there are some restrictions on who
should and when to listen and when not to, the *vEda-mantra*-s. When in
menstruation, women should not listen to any mantra-s. Why - is a different
topic and a big digression. *aruNam* should not be heard by pregnant women.
Some such other restrictions are there. Some should not be even chanted
post-lunch. Some should not be chanted after sunset.
3. There are no restrictions on listening and understanding the 'meaning' by
way of *pravachanam*-s etc., especially of *upanishat*-s. *Sradhdha* should
be there, that's all.


Surely there is no restriction on a woman attending a talk on the
upanishads??? or even imbibing that learning in her life?????

Such listening (with proper intent and *Sradhdha*, of course) and "imbibing
the learning in her life" is not only allowed, it is highly encouraged.
We would have done true justice to the *vEda*-s (and hence to ourselves)
only when the restrictions are properly followed. "*aachaara heenam na
punanti vEdaaH*" (even the *vEda* doesn't uplift those that don't follow the
restrictions.)

*vEdOnityamadheeyataam*
