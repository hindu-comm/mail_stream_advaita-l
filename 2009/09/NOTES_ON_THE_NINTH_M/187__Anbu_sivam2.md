NOTES ON THE NINTH MUSING (I)

We talked of the body in detail in the Ninth Musing. Needless to say that a
body is a body only so long as a Chaithanyam (sentient being) occupies it as
otherwise it will be an inert or dead body that would quickly disintegrate
and would not qualify to be called a body. Since we have different
bodies/organs, the Chaithanyam that occupies and directs each such
body/organ has a name. Given below is the list of bodies and the name of the
Lord who occupies it with remarks in brackets.
