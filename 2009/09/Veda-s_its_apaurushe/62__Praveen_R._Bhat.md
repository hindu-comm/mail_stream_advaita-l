Hari Om, Michael-ji,

Some of your poetry in this mail got me confused, so I'll reply only
on the last point :)

> it catch on ?

It would catch on as much as "I perceive your point" instead of "I
see your point" would, because when I see a point I don't literally
see a point, unless of course its a dot or gunpoint! ;)

Ta,
