Namaste Praveen ji,

Please excuse my sense of humour. Be assured that it runs in parallel with a
devout and profound seriousness !

If Sanatana Dharma becomes elusive in one faith, then buddhi may turn to
another faith to be reminded of the profundities of the human spirit.
It can lead to awkwardnesses of 'sacred conversation'; but they are as
nothing to the aim. It's only the weak-minded who fear some 'watering-down'
of the respective faiths.

I'm hugely hopeful of the 21st century in this respect. In my experience,
studying another faith system can deepen one's own faith. And Hinduism has
much to offer the undisciplined areas of Western society.

So I may continue to sport with the gopas of this list...

Pranams,
Michael

Why do I feel that you didn't say that with a straight face there? :)
In any case, if that was a serious tone, indeed, conversion is
hardly a good thing. I remember an incident from a book on HH
Chandrashekara Bharati Swamiji of Sringeri. One westerner wrote to
Swamiji requesting to be converted to Hinduism! Swamiji replied that
since he was born in a particular faith, it was best suited for
him to pursue his spiritual advances in that faith, indicating that
the progress, then, would be faster.

Why do I feel the same thing about this one too? :) Anyways... from
that story above, there is no envy necessary. Even if you don't
take away a thing from the story, be rest assured, I've got nothing
for anyone to be envious about.

I remain the common Self (that you and I are),
