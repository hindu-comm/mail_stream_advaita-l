An alternate way of seeing this, if I may suggest, is this : the Veda, as
veda, universal truth expressed in Sanatana Dharma, are applicable at all
times in all places in all situations..

So if you wake every morning to the fresh vision of a local hill or mountain
as the first light of dawn catches and reveals it in its eternal solitude
(before those Westerners insist on climbing it..) that image is likely to
become a symbol for you of awakening consciousness -- And thus the divine
nature of Creation acquires its local names and local sacred places... which
should never become exclusive; in the same way that the birth of your child
is an unique miracle --  but also universal..

The 'authorless' should increase our awe, not diminish it. Alas, the
'scientific' materialist culture wants to pin it down, just like 'the birth
of life on our planet' ! Who cares to name the author of a truth ?

compare with scientific laws.  gravity, relativity etc. are "unauthored"
yet they are expressed in terms belonging to a particular culture like E,
g, etc.  There is no reason we couldn't say OM = ma cha squared but we
don't.  In fact science is largely responsible for the continuing rapid
expansion of the English language accross the world.  Yet despite this you
can't make arguments such as e.g. Q was not originally a letter of the
latin alphabet so any formulas containing it are invalid.  Or Isaac Newton
was prejudiced against Indians therefore gravity doesn't apply in India.
(He wasn't as far as I know, this is just an example.)  It is this kind of
second-guessing of the meaning of the Vedas that the doctrine of
apaurusheyatva is trying to prevent.  That names are similiar to laukika
names is not relevant.  You have to call them something and these were the
names at hand.
