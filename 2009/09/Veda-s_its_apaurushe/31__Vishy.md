Pranams Bhaskarji

Here's my ex-colonial Abrahmanic RgVeda-moksa-mula-rised two-world
two-paise-worth :)

The Veda, as truth itself, are enshrined in the very nature of mankind. They
may be revealed by seers of the highest consciousness. And as truth itself,
they are/it is accessible to all faiths and all nations in all ages (indeed,
to extra-terrestrials too...)

So the scriptures of all these faiths -- according to the level of
consciousness of their seers -- will use the nama-rupa of their own local
space-time to express these truths. (More interesting that way..)

So the ardent seeker for truth will always look 'beyond' the nama-rupa for
truth, without denying its many names and forms, in good Indic tradition.

Yes, this is a tall order for any parampara...but by grace, atma is Brahma,
and every jiva -- aided by the Veda in all tongues -- may seek and even find
within his/her own inner nature, ultimate truth.. satyam eva jayate..

And that'll be two paise to you, Sahib... :)

Michael

One of my cybernet friends, expressed his observation on vedas'
aparusheyatva. I'd like to get the clarification on this from the learned
prabhuji-s of this forum. Here is his observation :

// quote //
What puzzled me was that the veda also had intimate knowledge of the
names,culture,topography etc of a very small place in the universe called
bhArata-varsha. This was proof to me that veda was "authored" by Indians!
Had it been unauthored and eternal, it will likely not show affinity
towards India will it? Why do you think veda has no names like John and
Peter? Why do you think it makes no reference to places such as Europe and
Africa? Why do you think it talks of ganga and sarasvati and not of Nile
or Amazon which are even bigger rivers? The proper nouns in the veda are
specific to our culture and it is the proof that it is not eternal and
unauthored. Veda as knowledge is eternal but as a text it appears to be a
divinely inspired content in accordance with place and time in which it
was revealed. If veda were to be revealed in another galaxy in another
planet how will they make sense of the names
in it? Obviously, if the veda is revealed there, its spiritual content
will be the same, but not the textual content.

PS : I've taken his concurrence to cross post his mail to other forum &
I've marked a copy of this mail to him also.
