I'm sure you do know that Vedas, apart from meaning wisdom, also have
a huge part that has mantras to be chanted as per svara. The translations
are no good there, because it is harmful to just read the Vedas and not
perform the rites/ chant those mantras, as I understand from Ishopanishad.

Of course, Upanishads are a different matter.
