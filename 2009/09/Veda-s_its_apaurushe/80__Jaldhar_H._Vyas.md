compare with scientific laws.  gravity, relativity etc. are "unauthored" 
yet they are expressed in terms belonging to a particular culture like E, 
g, etc.  There is no reason we couldn't say OM = ma cha squared but we 
don't.  In fact science is largely responsible for the continuing rapid 
expansion of the English language accross the world.  Yet despite this you 
can't make arguments such as e.g. Q was not originally a letter of the 
latin alphabet so any formulas containing it are invalid.  Or Isaac Newton 
was prejudiced against Indians therefore gravity doesn't apply in India. 
(He wasn't as far as I know, this is just an example.)  It is this kind of 
second-guessing of the meaning of the Vedas that the doctrine of 
apaurusheyatva is trying to prevent.  That names are similiar to laukika 
names is not relevant.  You have to call them something and these were the 
names at hand.
