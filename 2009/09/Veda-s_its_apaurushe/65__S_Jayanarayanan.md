You should ask your friend a simple question: "Please point to me a region of space (and time) where the Veda exists".

No matter where he points to, ask him how people outside that region know the Veda. Obviously, the words of the Veda are non-physical entities. The fact that words are eternal explains how people in different geographical areas of the world can know the same Veda at the same time. More at http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2004-February/013412.html

The nityatva of words/meanings is proven, but the apaurusheyatva of the Veda is a claim.

Plato uses similar reasoning to show that numbers (1,2,3...) are non-physical eternal entities:
