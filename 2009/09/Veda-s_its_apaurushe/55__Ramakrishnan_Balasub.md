No, of course I didn't know what you were trying to say - why would I
reply otherwise?

Let me repeat: the only pramANa for brahmAtma-aikya is the vedas (and
derivative sMR^iti) - not the Quran, nor anything else. No doubt there
is "wisdom" to be found in many different texts, no one is disputing
that, but the wisdom of non-duality is from the veda alone.

It certainly did not seem so to me. And if the Quran is equally a
pramANa for non-dual knowledge, isn't the dilution of authority rather
explicit?
