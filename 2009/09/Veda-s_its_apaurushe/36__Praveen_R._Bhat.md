Why do I feel that you didn't say that with a straight face there? :)
In any case, if that was a serious tone, indeed, conversion is
hardly a good thing. I remember an incident from a book on HH
Chandrashekara Bharati Swamiji of Sringeri. One westerner wrote to
Swamiji requesting to be converted to Hinduism! Swamiji replied that
since he was born in a particular faith, it was best suited for
him to pursue his spiritual advances in that faith, indicating that
the progress, then, would be faster.

Why do I feel the same thing about this one too? :) Anyways... from
that story above, there is no envy necessary. Even if you don't
take away a thing from the story, be rest assured, I've got nothing
for anyone to be envious about.

I remain the common Self (that you and I are),
