Praveen ji,

Wires got crossed there ! Dennis Waite's comments on the translation of
'apaurusheyatva' as 'authorless' got half-quoted back on this list.

So my comments were about how we should see the first 'seers' of the
(authorless) Veda.. how did they receive/perceive/ recognise/were
illuminated by/  these Veda ?

Not a point worth pursuing at this point perhaps; in fact maybe pointless;
unless of course, at gunpoint... but I take your point :)

Pranams
Michael

Hari Om, Michael-ji,

Some of your poetry in this mail got me confused, so I'll reply only
on the last point :)

> A seer 'sees'. We could call those great sages 'perceivers' I guess ?
Would
> it catch on ?

It would catch on as much as "I perceive your point" instead of "I
see your point" would, because when I see a point I don't literally
see a point, unless of course its a dot or gunpoint! ;)

Ta,
