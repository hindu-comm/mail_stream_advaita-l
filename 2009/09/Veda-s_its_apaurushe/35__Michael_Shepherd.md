Namaste Praveen-ji !

Yes, the mantras to which all Hindus devote themselves so assiduously every
day give them a huge advantage over the rest of the world. So Hindu
missionaries should be flooding the rest of the world, converting thousands
without aid of cash...

Meanwhile the rest of us look at such as yourself with discreet envy, and
struggle to ascend the foothills of the spiritual Himalayas, gazing with
admiration at your example from the unworthiness of our karma... :)

However, as Shri Maharaj Shantananda said, in his love for the boundless
self, 'There are slow ways and quick ways, and hard ways and easy
ways'...urging meditation on the unrealised and the realised alike..

So we Abrahmanics struggle on, remembering what we were also told -- that
the greatest gift one can give to one's fellow human beings is to remind
them that the Self is boundless..

Pranams,
Michael

I'm sure you do know that Vedas, apart from meaning wisdom, also have
a huge part that has mantras to be chanted as per svara. The translations
are no good there, because it is harmful to just read the Vedas and not
perform the rites/ chant those mantras, as I understand from Ishopanishad.

Of course, Upanishads are a different matter.
