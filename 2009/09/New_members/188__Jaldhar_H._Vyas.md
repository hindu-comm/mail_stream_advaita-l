I am a brahmin by birth and am interested in advaita studies.


mrs Ravindran

interested to know more about our religion and culture


Prasad Raviprolu

presently i am learning slokas of soundarya lahari, about 30 slokas i
completed and i am reading the digest of our paramcharya which is helping a
lot in getting meaning and as well as in depth understanding of soundarya
lahari, earlier i learnt sivanandha lahri around 70 slokas. i was looking
this site as Mr.V.Krishanamurthy gave the info on soundarya lahari. i am
very much interested to receive the entire slokas of soundarya lahari as
said by paramacharya. if any body can help it will be good.

regards

Prasad Raviprolu
