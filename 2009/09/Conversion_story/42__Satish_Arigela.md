But HH's dear student shrI abhinava vidyAtIrtha seems to accepting others as Hindu-s per shrI Stig's mention. He also quoted manu. That seems to have more strength.

This is for non Indians. They dont have a varNa and so they would not need one. They can follow the general prescriptions common to all varNa-s.
You know this and still whydo you try to muddle up the issue?

And why do you disagree? Please state your reasons. They were some swami-s who led a secular life till 30 or 40 s then started learning and attained GYAna(or so we hear).

What is the logical or scriptural basis for your disagreement?

As said before non-Indians need not be fitted into varNa-s.
See for example when the siddhAnta and the vAma streams of the shaiva mata made their way into East and South East Asia i.e. Combodia, Vietnam, Thailand etc as early as
5 or 6 th century CE, they followed the shaiva mata there. And apparentlythey followedtill the 13- 14 centuries till the Muslims wiped them out. 

They were all non- Indianswho did not have a varNa but followed shaiva mata for many centuries. They still do.. eventhough in small pockets. As you can see I am not suggesting something new!!

>That he will be a good fit isn't an assumption, somehow, but he may be
>lost is an invalid assumption?

Because I personally have seen a few and heard about many who were apparently not lost but their children also grew up as Hindus. This is the basis for my saying they need not be lost. Maybe there are few cases where people felt confused but that has to do with the individual and not the process.

There is no contradiction here. see below why. By the way it is clear now that it is not just my suggestion. HH AVT supports this. This suggestion was followed outside India(Thailand, Indonesia etc)for centuries. And it makes logical sense. These are strengths behind this line of argument

There are two possibilities: Either you dont understand what I say or you act as though you dont understand because it undoes your earlier statments about not allowing non-Indians to become Hindus. Whatever..

The said practitioner will become ashaiva(or any specialised shaiva like saiddhAntika, bhairavAchArin etc), or vaiShNava or shAkta because of his dIkSha into the same.

Since these various sub-sects are under the Hindu banner, they can be called Hindus.

This way is suggested because no purANa, or Agama talks about a Hindu dIkSha but only talk about dIkSha into their respective sub-sects.

Is that clear?

I should have clarified that what I found silly is the statment "where is the scope for one
to convert one's faith from what he is born into due to his karma?" and not the former part of the statment.
Isnt this similar to saying "where is the scope for one to migrate to kAshi because he/she was born in Andhra "- oh yes past karma made him take birth in Andhra..no? So he should stay there only..
