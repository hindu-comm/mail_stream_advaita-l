Hari Om, Satish-ji,

Thanks for your detailed clarifications.

It may have more strength in terms of acceptance but it has no mention
whatsoever of person's spiritual progress, AFAIK. There are
umpteen things that the shAstras suggest that a person "may" do in
terms of eligibility; I see it is an allowance.

I can't muddle up even if I wanted to, because I don't even know what
are the shAstric rules for non-varNa people, (that is, as you
said non-Indians without varNa!).

My reasons haven't changed at all. I still hold on to HH's words on
spiritual progress. If it hinders spiritual progress for the person
being converted, I will still lean towards not converting, even if
Manu approved it. Again, approval doesn't mean spiritual progress.

They were some swami-s who led a secular life till 30 or 40 s then
started learning and attained GYAna(or so we hear).

Were these Indian swamis or westerners? The former is besides the
point. If its the latter case, then the person who became a
sannyAsin will need to have converted to Hinduism and then become a
sannyAsin (hopefully as per the daSanAmi saMpradAya to be
valid for this thread).

Fair enough.

If it undid any of my statements, I'll readily accept, kindly don't
bother with assumptions. You really got me confused saying that
there is no way to convert to Hinduism first and then saying that there is...

... but now you're clear.

Ok, thats clearer.

No not totally, because while you talk of geographical changes that
may not have anything to do with a person's spiritual progress, I
was just following HH's words that religion changes/ conversions will
hinder spiritual progress. btw, you may be aware that there
are times when a person is suggested to do sAdhana at a particular
place for a better merit, including where he was born. So at
times, what you say may be helpful to a person's sAdhana on a
case-basis. But otherwise, religion changes should not be seen as
loosely as geographical changes, IMO.
