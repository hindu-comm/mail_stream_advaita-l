There are two types of people from the west.  Those who look at Hinduism and
appreciate it are like movie goers.  They appreciate it but carry on as
usual.

The others who feel sense in it.  They decide to abandon what they had been
born with and pursue what they found anew.  Many of them came and surredered
to Gurus like Ramana and settled down never to return.  There are others who
formed communities of their own in their own land just as the Hare Krishna
people.  There are lots of Ramana Satsanghs or gatherings devoted to other
gurus in the west.

We have lot of movie goers in this forum but that is what can be expected.
