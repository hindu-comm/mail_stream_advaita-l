I dont remember it either. Maybe somelese can help?

But I did assume that by "spiritual progress" it is meant "any advancement in pleasing the devata-s, i.e. various signs that the upAsaka comes across showing that the devata is pleased with the devotee, and conquering basic instincts, etc etc".. These ofcourse would help one on the pathto moxa.

Nodisagreement.

So HH never said you should not convert to Hinduism.Fine.
Evidence shows spiritual progress is not hampered in any way by converting to Hinduism.

I was referrring to HH AVT's quote from manu. As for Agama, i already told about shrIvidyArNava. A pa~nchama is technically outside the varNa system. Like wise see the Yogini tantra where it talks about giving dIkSha to non-Indians.

Wanted to see if we have the same thing in mind when using that term.

What I meant is that the "spiritual progress" which we defined will definitely happen for those sincere non-Indians who took dIkSha from traditional teachers.

Ask any well learned teacher and I am sure theywont say one will not benefitspiritually by choosing to convert to Hinduism. It is plainly illogical and contrary to reality as I see it.You may refer back to my first post to see why it is does not make any sense . Especially the scenarios I mentioned.

I wonder who translated those words of HH and how faithful that translation is.
