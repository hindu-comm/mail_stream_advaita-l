So the implication of your statement is that following the shAstra need not necessarily give "spiritual progress" - 1

the shrIvidyArNava says that even a chANDAla can be given dIkSha if he qualifies.
The qualifications being a list of traits which among othe rthings include "satya, ahiMsa, brahmacharya, interest in studying teh shAstra-s etc etc..
Likewise the yoginI tantra says that non-indians can be initiated too when divine qualities are found in them. So these would beyama-s, niyama-s etc.

So your only concern is "spiritual progress" - 2

Sanyasis are not the only ones I had in mind. There are house-holders too.
Why this fixation with becoming a sanyasin? For example, I wouldnever want to become a sanyasin..but there are tons of spiritual practices that I can follow or in some cases required to follow.

"Spiritual progress" again. -3

So it looks like this is what you are concerned about..spiritual progress..not necessarily everybody's concern.

So what exactly are AchArya-s words? AchArya might have used a sanskirt word for this?

Can you define what exactly you mean by this "spiritual progress"?

**In conclusion,it seems that itis absolutely alright for Westerners and others to convert to Hinduism since there is nothing against this shift. This is supported by the Agama-s specifically mentioning dIkSha to all eligible(criteria mentioned above)candidates.
--Which is my primary concern and question in the begining of this thread--

They(Agama and smriti)are explicit that a varNa tag is not required(fornon-Indians)to be a Hindu**

There seems to be some doubt about this so called "spiritual progress", which probably our friend will explain what it is. But it is shown that this "spiritual progress" need not come in the way of practicing Hindu rituals.
