It was a parallel, nothing more. Would it have sounded more
appropriate if I had said that if people living there wanted to merge
with India being dissatisfied with their countries or something like that?

Okay, maybe you did. Lets say I found HH more convincing and lets just
leave it at that.

Thats very interesting! Solves lot of "problems" within Hinduism
itself, not necessarily only westerners converting to Hinduism.

And that would help his spiritual progress in your opinion. I disagree.

It wasn't a dissociated question, but okay, fair enough. I'd rather be
ignorant about this and not look around.

Yes, to me it is, without varNa as it seems he will have adhikAra as
defined by whoever will convert him, I suppose.

That he will be a good fit isn't an assumption, somehow, but he may be
lost is an invalid assumption?

Well, I surely am alien to assessing anyone spiritual progress, including mine!

Why are you contradicting here? If there can't be a conversion, you
may have let HH's words remain as they are instead of putting
them aside and making your own suggestions on what to do!

I'm confused whether or not then this person (here I too mean that
westerner) will become a Hindu; or will become a shaiva or
vaishnava, etc, without being a Hindu; or will become a Hindu as well
as a shaiva, vaishnava, etc. Would this be the conversion
ceremony that you said didn't exist?

Thanks, that solves at least one problem: we won't have to argue
further, because the entire premise of HH and my faith in HH's
premise is based on this past karma! :)
