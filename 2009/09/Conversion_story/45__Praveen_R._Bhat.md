Yes, while your concern seems to be conversion. But then, I did
mention this in the first mail. If it isn't everybody's concern, let
people convert all they need. Didn't HH raise only the concern about
spiritual progress (-- 4?) alone? We have been exchanging
mails at a tangent now, as it is clear now, since your concerns and
mine are totally different. You raised questions that are not my
concern at all!

I read an English book. I don't have a clue what word HH used to mean
spiritual progress, but I believe the translation is to the word. You
too seem to have read it, maybe you remember.

Its the same thing which you've concluded to be not "everybody's
concern". But I think it is that which takes you close to moksha.
Would you disagree?

I don't think I mentioned HH ever saying its not alright to convert to
Hinduism, but those two golden words that would make the
count 5! :)

Kindly give a reference for my benefit. I'd like to look it up and
understand where Agama and smriti talks of this specific thing.

Thats interesting again. Somehow, you want me to explain what
spiritual progress is but its already "shown" that it need not come in
the way of practicing Hindu rituals. So perhaps, the onus is on you to
explain what is it that won't come in the way of those rituals.
I've no clue beyond taking HH's words "as is". You seem to have a
better idea, so I'd rather have you explain it, not me!

I don't see I have much to add to this chain, beyond "spiritual
progress" a few more times.
