Dear Dr.Bharadwaj,

In an earlier thread on Sudhra from which this one has branched out I posted
a relevant part of my Musings on the fundamentals of Hinduism in my
discussion with Sri Michael Sheppard. That is probably the reason that you
missed. I am posting them in this forum under a new thread 'Munsings on the
Fundamentals of Hinduism' for the benefit of readers like you.

Regards,
Anbu
