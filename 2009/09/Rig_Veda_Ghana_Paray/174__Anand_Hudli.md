Dear Friends,



Rig Veda Ghana Patha Parayana is going on at the Sringeri Shankara Math, Mysore. The

recital takes place in three sessions every day - 8:00 AM to 12:30 PM, 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM,

 and 5:30 PM to 8:00 PM. The program ends on 17-9-2009. 



The GhanapAThI group is headed by Shri Lakshminarayana Bhat, the eminent Vedic scholar

from Sringeri (who currently resides in Kundapura). 



SamhitA pATha is the straight-forward method of chanting where the words are chanted in

the order of occurrence - 1-2-3-4-...

Ghana pATha involves reciting the Veda in a complex pattern - 1-2-2-1-1-2-3-3-2-1-1-2-3...

Actually, GhanapATha is one of the aShTa-vikR^itis, the others being, jaTA, mAlA, shikhA, 

rekhA, dhvaja, daNDa, and ratha. According a verse in the Varaha purANa, the puNya of 

reciting the pada-pATha is twice that of the saMhitA pATha, the puNya obtained by reciting

the krama pATha is thrice that of the saMhitA, and the puNya from the recital of the 

aShTa-vikR^itis such as the jaTA pATha is six times that of the saMhitA. 



Reaching the Shankara Math is easy once you get to Mysore. It is located on a street close

to the palace, near the south gate. You can find it in Google Maps.



Regards,


Anand
