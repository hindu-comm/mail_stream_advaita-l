I've just been encouraged, by dipping into Wilhelm Halbfass' book of
thought-provoking essays 'Tradition and Reflection', from Sri Satguru
Publications, to buy his 'India and Europe : An Essay in Understanding'.

But to judge from the high price, either new or secondhand, it's a
much-prized book.. Has anyone here read it, and could give a detached
opinion as to its value ?

Pranams,
Michael
