The same way the sweetness in Shakespeare's poetry can be proved :-).

Indology and many other such disciplines are quite clueless about what
"science" means. This is not to say that these disciplines are useless -
they are very useful. But, study of texts can never be "scientific". That's
why they are in the humanities departments.

After Fritz Staal, there has been some activity in actually "observing" what
people do. But it is more to point out in a rather superior manner that the
people are not doing exactly what some text is prescribing, and how they
know the texts much better. It is changing a bit though, which is
encouraging.
