But how would you explain great
many Gnanis from Janaka onwards who remained Jivanmukthas without entering
Sanyasa Aasrama?
***
With regards to Janaka Shankara at two separate instances in his Gitabbhashya lays open the possibility that he was not a jivanmukta. Regardless even if one considers He was, one can consider it secondary to prarabdha and treat it as an exceptional case.

With regards to Bhagwan Ramana He was the very embodiment of the Highest ideals of sannyasa as enunciated by our Bhagawatpada. As my essay well-illustrates sannyasa in this context is not NECESSARILY characterized by/restricted to ochre robes or any other paraphrenalia and instead consists of renunciation of all actions including even those considered necessary for the body;s sustenance. Witness "..he should cover himself by strips of cloth.." "should be without any insignia.." etc
