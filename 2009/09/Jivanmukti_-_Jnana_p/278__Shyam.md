Pranams Bhaskar-ji

You write:
IMO, it is farfetched declaration that saNyAsi should not even do a bit to 
sustain his body...'vyuttAya bhikshAcharyaM charaNti' shruti clearly says 
he should live on alms...nivruttena chet jeevana mAtrArthaM says shankara 
in geeta bhAshya....so, renunuciation of all actions (sarvakarma saNyAsa) 
does not mean he should lie on a ground like a wooden plate & should 
starve  till death :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

My response:
Please read what Shankara says: Even after giving up the flaws of the senses and mind ONE MAY HAVE TO maintain external possessions to SUPPORT LIFE shareeradharana prasangena dharmanushtana nimittena vaa baahya parigrahah prapta; pramahamsa parivrajaka bhutvA - tam cha vimuchya parivrajya THIS TOO has to be renounced - in other words becoming a menicant of the Parahamsa Order.." Is it clear enough?

Bhaskar-ji, there is something called prarabdha - the body, like an arrow that has already been shot, will continue until it exhausts the karmic momentum and falls - what difference does it make to a Jnani if such were to happen, and why should he strive to co-operate if his mind is singlepointedly focussed on the Atman - the Lord Himself will ensure his sustenance "- atah Bhagwaan EVA teshaam yogakshemam vahatiti"

See how we shudder to even imagine that state of mind? Hopefully one can better appreciate now the difference between a grhastha and such a vidwat sannyasa, and why only the latter attains fitness in due time for Mukti.
