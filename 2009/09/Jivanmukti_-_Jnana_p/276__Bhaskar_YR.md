As my essay well-illustrates sannyasa in this context is not NECESSARILY 
characterized by/restricted to ochre robes or any other paraphrenalia and 
instead consists of renunciation of all actions including even those 
considered necessary for the body;s sustenance. Witness "..he should cover 
himself by strips of cloth.." "should be without any insignia.." etc

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

IMO, it is farfetched declaration that saNyAsi should not even do a bit to 
sustain his body...'vyuttAya bhikshAcharyaM charaNti' shruti clearly says 
he should live on alms...nivruttena chet jeevana mAtrArthaM says shankara 
in geeta bhAshya....so, renunuciation of all actions (sarvakarma saNyAsa) 
does not mean he should lie on a ground like a wooden plate & should 
starve  till death :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
