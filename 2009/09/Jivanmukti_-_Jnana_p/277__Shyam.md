Pranams Sunil-ji

First in the very introduction to the Gita - "...athah na te(janakaadayah) tattvavidah - ishwarasamarpitena karmanaa sadhanabhutena samsiddhim sattvashuddim..".."..now if on the other hand it is held that they (Janaka and others) were not enlightened the passage may be explained to mean that Janaka and others like him achieved purity of mind by means of actions dedicated to God.

Once again in the bhashya for 3.20 - atha apraptasamyagdarshanaah janakaadayah - If however Janaka, and others had NOT attained right perception..

Hari OM
