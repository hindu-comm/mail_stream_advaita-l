May I add something from experience in the ashrama ?

Those who have been well and spiritually educated up to age 16 are well set for life, could not be better set.

But for most, householder and bread-winner coincide in the next ashrama. 
So we are going to spend that time in an environment which is calling for 'I am the doer..'
But how valuable to attempt to have upasana of the mahavakya in one's working life, let alone at home ! One person alone in a factory, go-down, or office who hold the mahavakya within, can lighten the tone of the whole workplace and lift that burden of 'I am the doer' a little or a lot..

And then vanaprastha becomes, can become, a life of bliss. As someone here said to me, 'It's a time for attending to those aspects of samashthi which have not previously been fully attended to'.. 

One may never attain or choose sannyasa. But I'm sure that there are a number on this site who would acknowledge that -- especially these days of easier communication which don't involve a weary body, and longer lives of retirement...vanaprastha is going to become the glory of spiritual life in the 21st century..

Dear Sivam-ji
Pranams.
Thank you for your kind words.
You write:
"It is our conviction that all jeevas are Brahman in lakshyaartham, if not the Mahaavaakyas would be meaningless.  So much so, would it not be important that people realize the ego to be the culprit and try renonuncing it rather than the Ashrama?"
***
My response:
Yes to both! - I dont think it is a either/or here - what Shankara is saying is that the latter ALONE (i.e. sannyasa) is logically plausible if the former (i.e. effacement of the ego) is to be enabled.

After all what is the ego but the conviction of the "aham" pratyaya wedded to the dehatmabuddhi? And in our daily life, we are ever absorbed in the conviction - that aham dehosmi....(ahamidam mamaidam naisargikoyam)..as soon as we wake up at dawn from Maya's sweet embrace of sushupti, in every thing we do, there is an all-consuming ever-present conviction that we verily are this limited individual - eating, talking, working, hearing - we are ever established in that self which is the non-Self....in a rare case, thanks to the blessing of years of Vedanta vichara an insight may be gained that allows an unprepared seeker the conviction of "aham brahmasmi" - unfortunately interspersed with a durvasana-actuated viparita bhavana - where the antahkarana reverts immediately back to the perfunctory ahamidam mamaidam "samadhi". Reversing this situation, so that, where sitting, walking, eating, talking, aham brahmasmi absorption is constant interspersed only
 momentarily with prarabdha--related empirical engagements - is undoubtedly an arduously long journey. And such a journey is impossible without an "ashrama" that allows you sarvakarmasannyasa - where even the maintenance of the body is not allowed to be a matter of concern or an impediment to constant and singlepointed nidhidyasana - where the thoughts akin to the flow of oil (taila dharavat) are all directed towards the Self to the exclusion of every other thought or cognition. On the other hand in any other ashrama, the conviction of "aham idam mama idam" can only keep getting incessantly reinforced no matter how much effort the individual may put in. At least such is my understanding of Shankara's stated position on this issue.

Sunil-ji
Pranams.
You write
"What can be the better way of renunciation than doing Niskaama karma, which is a way of denying the ego-Self."
***
My response:
You are absolutely correct and would be fully aligned with what Bhagwan Krishna has to say in the 18th chapter - provided one is talking about a seeker and not a knower. Can a "knower" i.e. brahmavit, do nishkama karma, and is that the same as sannyasa, is something I shall endavor to discuss in my next instalment of my series.
