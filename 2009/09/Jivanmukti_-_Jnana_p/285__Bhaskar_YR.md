If Kshathriyas, Vaisyas and Sudhras abandon their karmas then the world 
will
collapse.  So they are not qualified for sanyaasa aashrama. 

In essense only Brahmins are qualified to enter sanyaasa aashrama.

Yes, shankara says in his bhAshya that only brahmaNa-s have the adhikAra 
to take saNyAsa, but he never ever denied jeevan mukti or samyakdarshitva 
to other capable varNAshrami-s.  If we say ONLY inhabitants of 
saNyAsAshrama are jeevan mukta-s, then we are denying this status to other 
varNAshrami-s which results in a declaration that 'jeevanmuktAvastha is 
the sole property of brahAmis who took saNyAsa'..this is quite absurd. 
Anyway, as a side note, surEshwarAchArya, elsewhere grants permission to 
kshatriya & vyshya also to take saNyAsa.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
