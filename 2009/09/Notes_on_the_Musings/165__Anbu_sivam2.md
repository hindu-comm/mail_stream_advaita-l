Dear kman,

What I posted under  Musings on the Fundamentals of Hinduism -7 and the
notes thereon are based on Brihadharanyaka Upanishad (1.iv.11) onwards.  I
wrote them in the tradition of Adi Sankara in exposing the illogics of other
samayas.

If you wish to post criticism do it properly instead of your silly
judgment.

I pray for some divine light on you too.  You do need it more for your
intolerance.
