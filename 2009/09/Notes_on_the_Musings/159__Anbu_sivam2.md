Michaelji,

Quote: "Your interesting generalisations and over-simplifications contain
some valuable half-truths, in my opinion."

Thanks for your eagerness in pronouncing judgements!  It comes from the
ingrainment of abrahamic religions in their understanding of one birth only.

*First and foremost understanding of a jeeva irrespective of his varna is
that he is a bhOktha and a karmi.  That is all he is! *

No matter whether one is an emperor or a chaprasi all he does in life is
sometimes enjoy and most of the time suffer in many differnt ways!

These karmam and bhOgam constitute his karmaphala of the previous births.
In other words you are born here to enjoy and suffer period. Nothing more
and nothing less.  *You are not created by a whimsical God.  You are a
product of your own self.
*
Remember karma is painful and forms part of his suffering.  What you enjoy
and suffer is of course through this body (*actually the three bodies one
possesses viz. sthoola, sookshma and kaaraNa sarirams) and these bodies are
guna born.*  The nature of the guna in these bodies enable the corresponding
bhogam and karma.  The particular body is thus fashioned as one's body for
him to reside as a 'gift' if you please not at random but as one's
karmaphala by the Dhaatha viz. Easwara.  Residing in the body made of guna
and driven by his samskaara one strives to find his purushartha.

Look through this scheme at the examples you cited (such as a person working
in an assembly line etc.) and perhaps then you would understand the many
ways one enjoys, suffers and perfects his being.

The salient features of the guna conditioning of the four varnas were given
by me but they are not exhaustive.  A 'perfection' is achieved by a potter
or an atomic scientist or an enterpreneur in their own field of endeavour
and also by a Brahmana as a jeevan mukhtha.  Such are our opportunities!

It is true that people try to don the hats of more than one varna.  Surely
we Hindus hold that you can do what you like!  But we point out that there
is no impediment in being one's own self but there are lots of impediments
in being someone else and a person also commits transgressions and the
consequences of them follow in this or the next birth.  This comes under
dharma and adharma concepts.

Yes sir, *YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE BUT THE OUTCOME IN TERMS OF ENJOYMENT
WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME AND YOUR SUFFERING WILL IN NO WAY INCREASE OR
DECREASE BY YOUR CHOICE!*

*What I am saying is that such options to weild the roles of other varnas
are not productive in terms of karma and bhogam that one is destined
with.*(Karthur aagnyayaa praapyathE phalam, karma kim param karma
thajjadam).
