What a  pathetically, political interpretation of any rite - even the
puruShamedha. The puruShamedha is clearly an ode to the supreme,
cosmic puruSha, and the shatapatha brAhmaNa clearly forbids actual
sacrifice of the human beings. Whether it was actually performed or
not, I for one hope, hope that I'll never reach this cynical
interpretations of our rituals.
