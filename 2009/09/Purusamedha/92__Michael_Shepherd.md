It often occurs to me in this context, that what we lack is the record -- or
the imagination -- to project ourselves into that time and cast of mind,
when the surrender -- willing or unwilling -- of life (in times when life
was short and often violent anyway) had a spiritually elevating intention.

In Britain and Scandinavia and beyond even into the 6th century CE/AD or
later, there were 'ship burials' where the chieftain was buried with his
ship, and his loyal servants around him.. who knows what they each hoped for
in a next life ?

The difference is as Ramakrishnan mentioned, we have literary and
archeological evidence for the historical performance of those yajnas
involving real slayings while we do not for the purushamedha.

I do not see any evidence for this.  From the ritualistic point of view,
the purushamedha is not related to the ashvamedha.

He is mentioned in the saMbhavaparvan of the Adiparvan of the Mahabharata,
adhyaya 90, shloka 19 in the BORI critical edition

"Mahabhauma[1] married the daughter of Prasenajit named Suyajna. From her
was
born Ayutanayi.  He performed a purushamedha in which an ayuta[2]  was
brought.  Because of this he was called Ayutanayi."

[1] this shloka is part of a geneology of the Paurava dynasty.
[2] A regiment of 10,000 men.

I direct you to the word Anayat which means "brought near" or "collected."
does this necessarily imply the sacrificial victims were killed?  Or were
they just bound?  It is too ambiguous to say conclusively.  Also why
assume the ayuta was composed of his enemies?

I think you are reading way more into this shloka than it will allow.
The motifs of the ashvmedha are unmistakably royal.  They celebrate a
powerful kings physical domination over the land and the submission of its
people.  By contrast the purushamedha as per the descriptions in the
Brahmanas is about "becoming all" in a metaphysical as well as a physical
sense.  It is about lordship through diffusion of power not concentration
of power.
