Purushamedha was the earliest starting from Viraatapurusha as the
pasu.  *Purushamedha
was always symbolic and never actual* starting from Viraatapurusha himself.
In the case of Viraatapurusha he became many while being a Brahmana himself.

Brahmins stopped officiating in Purushamedha even during the Vedic period
(whatever that means!) perhaps after the attempted sacrifice of
Sunahkshepa.   But the kshathriyas continued it.  The famous one was making
Iravan as kaLabhali during Mahabharatha war.

Even to this day Purushamedha is continued  in the 'fire-walking' in many
temples across India.
