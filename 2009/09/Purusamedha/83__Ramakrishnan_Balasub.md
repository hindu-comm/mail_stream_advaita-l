The shatapatha brAhmaNa specifies that the human beings are merely
tied up and released - not actually sacrificed. The purushamedha is a
sacrifice to the cosmic puruSha - the "victims" are all different
human beings - a brahmin, kShatriya, etc., and also from different
professions. The list of victims can be found in the taittiriya
brAhmaNa 3.4, beginning with brahmaNe brAhmaNam Alabhate, kShatrAya
rAjanyam, etc. A very similar list can be found in the shatapatha
brAhmaNa also.

It may or may not have been actually performed - but there are no
recorded instances of these being actually performed unlike other
sacrifices such as ashvamedha, rAjasUya, etc. A few srauta texts
actually claim contrary to the shatapatha brAhmaNa that the victims
are actually sacrificed.

This is the advaita-l - not perhaps the best forum for finding out
what Srivaishnavas or Madhvas have to say regarding this.
