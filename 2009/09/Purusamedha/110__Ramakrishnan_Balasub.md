You have to differentiate between the puruShamedha - the shrauta
ritual, versus any random thing which may have been practiced by
people. In fact even now some such case pops up in the news, once in a
while.

The puruShamedha requires not 1 person, but literally more than a
hundred. There may have been many so called tantrik rituals performing
these sacrifices. Does this story talk about the rest of the people
also? If not let's admit that this story is not about puruShamedha the
shrauta ritual.
