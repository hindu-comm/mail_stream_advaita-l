Sunil ji,

You have touched on the original intention of 'incarceration' in prison, beyond protecting society -- to encourage 'repentence' for the deed in the individual; whether for a period of incarceration, or to the death penalty. Some prisons today and their 'faith' visitors put in a great deal of such work --frequently offering various forms of meditation as a commencement of this process; and especially for those condemned to death. One of Christianity's better moments...

Michael

Dear friends,

Just a thought. Sometimes for political or some grave social reasons  a captive has to be executed as he is a danger to the kingdom or the society as the crime is such that it calls for death penalty. But if that person is sacrificed to God the person may not die with an animosity as the person might think that he will have to die anyway but what can be the better way of dying than going to the God. This way, at the last moment of his life, that person will think of God  and will get deliverence too. This could thus be a way of Loka-sangraha, even in the death penalty. This is just a thought and if you think fit to reply please do.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Ok. I wonder if this is because the practice was abandoned even in ancient(like 2000 yrs) times?

Is the similarity of the names just a coincidence then? Just wondering why is it called puruSha-medha instead of puruSha yajna or by some other suffix? Maybe there are other examples where two different shrauta rites had similar names but from a ritualistic  viewpoint they are quite different?

Agreed about the ambiguity if only looking at this passage..but see below

It is about lordship through >diffusion of power not concentration of
power.

Also a quote by the same acquaintance in a different context:

"Another notable shrauta oblation made to revatI was in the human sacrifice â€“ the puruShamedha
ritual. In the ashvamedha before the horse is sent off to wander for an
year an oblation is performed to pUShan pathikR^it to protect the
horse. In the puruShamedha,
in place of this pUShan ritual, one is performed to the 3 devI-s,
anumatI, revatI and aditi. This is recorded in both R^igvedic and
atharvavedic tradition (shA~NkhAyana shrauta 16.10.11; vaitAna shrauta
sUtra 37.10.20)."

Based on this I tend to think that it was practiced in very ancient times but the ritual involving human sacrifice was abandoned so long back.
