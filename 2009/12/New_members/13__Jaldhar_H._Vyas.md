Hari Sarma

Advaita vedanta and its importance in understanding aspects of sanathana 
dharma.


Yajvan

Namasté and hello,
My interests are simple and straight forward. The combination of knowledge
and experience that nurtures kaivalya ( some wish to call mokṣa).

Knowledge is the greatest purifier say the wise... learning grooms
expansiveness. Done correctly it should dampen or at least put in
perspective the role of the ego (ahaṅkāra, some prefer
ahaṃkāra). To this advaita-vedanta is a great purifier.

May only good come from the posts I read, and good (sattva) come from the
posts I offer. May we all be guided by the wise (jñātā).

praṇām
