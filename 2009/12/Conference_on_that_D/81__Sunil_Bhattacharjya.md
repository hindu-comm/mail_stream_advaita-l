Do you think the Mathadhipatiis of the Sringeri Math lied when that Math said earlier that Adi Sankaracharya was born in 44 BCE? So beware of casting aspersions on scholars without adequate knowledge. What according to you is the correct date of Adi Sankaracharya and what evidences do you adduce to prove that?

>Lord Buddha was born in 1887 BCE

As kids we were often warned about lying.. that to cover up one lie.. you will need to invent more lies.

Some people might have aged but they still havent learnt this simple kindergarten lesson, it would seem...

To all those sensible people...good luck in convincing the mUrkha janAH.

To that other learned member: No amountof schloarly research or material will convince them.. they already made up their mind. Those minds that are open/impartial will pause to think after some hints..if they dont ..we would be wasting time on them..
