Hi All,

Should we have to discuss about the date of acharyaal so elaborately? When
he didnt want to mention his age?

I have been a member of this group for about 2-3 months now. I used to get
one or two mails everyday mostly Mr.Anbu Sivam2's posts
about Sivaanandalahari. But now when there is post looming about a topic,
which "Doesnt has a common consensus amongst our gurus", everyone chips in.

Even if we get the MWP Ujjain professor's paper or artcle and it gives us a
glaring evidence, would this reduce or increase our guru bhakthi? Definitely
NO.

I am sorry to say these posts remind me of the "Advaita Vs Dwaita" loops
what i found in the archives.

Possibly the best thing we can do is to use these efforts to share something
"what u know and i dont".

Thanks,
GK
