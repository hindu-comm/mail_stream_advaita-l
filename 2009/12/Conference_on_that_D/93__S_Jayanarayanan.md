The last statement is extremely significant. The Sringeri Math is the greatest institution of traditional Dharma in India, if not the world.

Here are the chief reasons why:

1) Purity: The Sringeri Math has maintained moral purity that is truly exceptional, remaining above all scandals of any sort.

2) Lineage: The unbroken lineage of Gurus can be traced directly to Adi Sankara.

3) Historicity: The Sringeri Math is mentioned in indisputably historical sources such as the Madhaviya Sankara Digvijayam.

To even "defend" the Sringeri Math borders on egotism!

It is telling that other Maths such as those at Kanchi and Holenarsipur do not pass the above criteria.
