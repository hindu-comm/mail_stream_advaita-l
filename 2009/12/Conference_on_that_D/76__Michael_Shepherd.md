somewhere..

I don't get it.  This says:

> Putting an end to controversy, sankaracharyas across the country today
> unanimously accepted April 3, 509 BC as Adi Sankaras exact date of
> birth.

and then it says:

> Sankaracharyas of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham, Dwarka Jyotirmath, Badrinath

What about Sringeri?  What kind of unanimity is that?

I still don't know the title or venue of the original 2002 conference
that gave rise to this thread - looked through the advaita-l archives but
couldn't find it.  Is that conference the same as the one mentioned in
this (Jan, 2003) article?

Thanks,
Gerald Penn
