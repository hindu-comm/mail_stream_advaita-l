>Lord Buddha was born in 1887 BCE

As kids we were often warned about lying.. that to cover up one lie.. you will need to invent more lies.

Some people might have aged but they still havent learnt this simple kindergarten lesson, it would seem...

To all those sensible people...good luck in convincing the mUrkha janAH.

To that other learned member: No amountof schloarly research or material will convince them.. they already made up their mind. Those minds that are open/impartial will pause to think after some hints..if they dont ..we would be wasting time on them..
