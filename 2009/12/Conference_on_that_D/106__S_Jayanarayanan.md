Well said!! That is the most intellectually and refreshingly honest thing I've heard in a long time! Wish you a very, very happy new year :)

Not only the above point about historicity and lineage, but the purity of the place makes the Sringeri Math a great center of Dharma and Yoga.

Besides, one of the Puri Sankaracharyas was a disciple of a Sringeri Acharya, and the present Dwaraka (also Jyotir) Math Sankaracharya, Swami Swarupananda, was coronated by a Sringeri Acharya. Many of the Ramakrishna Mission monks have held the Sringeri Math to be pre-eminent in teaching Advaita Vedanta.

If there is one tradition that deserves to be called "The Most Authentic Tradition", it is the Sringeri Math.
