Karthik,

I have never come across anywhere that the Holenarsipur organisation ever claims any unbroken lineage of Bhagavan Sri Shankaracharya. So, I feel it is irrelevant to drag them into this topic for no reason. Of course I am not the official spokesperson for them; but nevertheless; that Swamiji to my knowledge never made any such a claim.

Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.

The last statement is extremely significant. The Sringeri Math is the greatest institution of traditional Dharma in India, if not the world.

Here are the chief reasons why:

1) Purity: The Sringeri Math has maintained moral purity that is truly exceptional, remaining above all scandals of any sort.

2) Lineage: The unbroken lineage of Gurus can be traced directly to Adi Sankara.

3) Historicity: The Sringeri Math is mentioned in indisputably historical sources such as the Madhaviya Sankara Digvijayam.

To even "defend" the Sringeri Math borders on egotism!

It is telling that other Maths such as those at Kanchi and Holenarsipur do not pass the above criteria.

Regards,
Kartik
