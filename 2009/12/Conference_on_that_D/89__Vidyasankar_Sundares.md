I would request you to show me a single posting from me in the current thread
where I have said anything to hurt feelings of devotees. The only person I have

even mentioned by name is Shrikant Jichkar, a dead Indian politician. I have only

generally described some of the political compulsions in keeping this debate alive,
as opposed to valid and honest, traditional/scholarly disagreements about it.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
