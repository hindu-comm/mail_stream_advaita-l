Kartik, do not make this conversation degenerate into a "my guru is better 
than your guru" contest.  That is not helpful to anyone.

The contributions of Kanchi and Holenarsipur to Advaita Vedanta are so 
vast their views demand attention even from those who find the Shringeri 
tradition self-sufficient.

At the same time I would remind readers that we follow these acharyas for
their knowledge of dharma and moksha not for their historical opinions. 
It is not an offense if we disagree with one or more of them on the 
historical details and by trying to understand the historical sequence of 
our cultures development we are not impeding our progress in dharma and 
moksha in any way.  (The corollary of this is don't obsess about 
historical questions either.  It won't make you a better Advaitin.)
