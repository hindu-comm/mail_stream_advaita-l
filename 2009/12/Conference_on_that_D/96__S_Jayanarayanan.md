No one questioned the integrity or credibility of any Maths, certainly not me.

Vidyasankar mentioned that the Sringeri Math was "arguably the most authentic tradition". I gave my opinion of the criteria that can be used to decide on the title of "most authentic tradition", and why the Sringeri Math had a strong case for the title compared to the other Maths. In other words, since the "most authentic tradition" can be held by other Maths such as Kanchi and Holenarsipur, I pointed out that the Sringeri Math was the best choice for the title.

It is just that out of the three Maths that may compete for the title - Sringeri, Kanchi, Holenarsipur - the first one is most likely to hold the title of "most authentic tradition" (according to the criteria that I outlined).

I believe I kept myself completely within the discussion of the thread.
