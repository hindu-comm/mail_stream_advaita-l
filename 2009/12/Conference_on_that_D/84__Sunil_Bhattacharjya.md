Dear Shri Rameshji,

You said as follows:

My personal opinion is that this stand is historically untenable. That Sankaracharya lived sometime between 600-800 CE and the Buddha between 600-400 BCE is the most likely scenario.

What is the basis for your assertion? What do you think about the opinion of the Sringeri Math till the early twentieth century that Adi Sankaracharya was born in 44 BCE? What do you think about King Sudhanva's copper inscription, which according to the Dwarka Math settles that date of adi sankaracharya inscription?

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Nobody suggests that Sankaracharya was prior to the Buddha. Those who
suggest a 500 BCE date for Sankaracharya also push back the Buddha's
date to ~1800 BCE.

My personal opinion is that this stand is historically untenable. That
Sankaracharya lived sometime between 600-800 CE and the Buddha
between 600-400 BCE is the most likely scenario.
