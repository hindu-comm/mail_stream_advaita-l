Nobody suggests that Sankaracharya was prior to the Buddha. Those who
suggest a 500 BCE date for Sankaracharya also push back the Buddha's
date to ~1800 BCE.

My personal opinion is that this stand is historically untenable. That
Sankaracharya  lived sometime between 600-800 CE and the Buddha
between 600-400 BCE is the most likely scenario.
