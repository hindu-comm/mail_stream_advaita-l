I received a private email from a scholar who is not on this list, with some links that may be of
interest to some readers on this thread. The pages to which these links will take you contain 
an English rendering of a benedictory talk in Kannada by Swami Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha, the
previous Acharya of Sringeri, given in 1988. Please take the time to read these and get the
views of the Sringeri Acharya directly, about the date of Adi Sankaracharya.
