I pray to Lord Shiva, who has blue neck like that of a peacock, Lord in whom
excels the shining dance, done at the dusk which looks like the rainy season
at the end of summer, when the drum beats made with the hands of VishNu is
like the thunder from the clouds, when the looks of Devas is like the
lightening, the tears of joy from the devotees is like rain and in presence
of Parvati as the peahen.

அண்டங்கள் ஏழினுக் கப்புறத் தப்பான்
உண்டென்ற சத்தி சதாசிவத் துச்சிமேற்
கண்டங் கரியான் கருணை திருவுருக்
கொண்டங் குமைகாணக் கூத்துகந் தானே.
(திருமந்திரம்)

To the peacock of ParamEswara evening time is the beginning of the year.  In
the same way the sounds emanating from the beating of the drums by the hands
of Mahaavishnu is the thundering of the clouds.  Besides the crores of the
eyes of the dEvas witnessing remains the lightning.  And to this peacock the
the gushing of the tears of joy of the bhakthaas happen to be the shower.
And the peahen of Parvathi is the driving spirit to the dance of ecstacy!

With all the above vaibhavas and sarvOthkrishtas or excellences the dance of
Siva of the blue neck described as ujvalathaandavam is the one that adore
and worship.

Because of kaaLakoota visham that He swallowed and held in the throat by
Paarvathi's intervention, Siva has turned out to be the blue necked
Neelakantan just like a peacock. Also the dance of the peacock is beautiful
to watch just like the thaandavam of Siva. And both of them dance in ecstacy
at the sight of their mates!

Aum Sri Neelakantaaya Namaha.
