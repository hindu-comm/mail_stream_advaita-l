*Sivaanandalahari - 50 (3)

*(continued from 50 (2))

All the bhoomis come to light as lingaswaroopam also the entire jagat has
bhaasitham in lingaswaroopam.  Punya theerthaas are of lingaswaroopam. And
everything is based on lingaswaroopam only.  There are crores and crores of
lingas in paathaaLa and and DevalOka.  ParamEswara is praised in sakala
lOkas.  The mahima of sivalinga is described in the kOti rudhra samhithai of
Siva PuraaNa.  Let us now know of the mahima of the dwaadhasa linga among
the jyothir lingas.

That is sOmanaadhEswaralingam, mallikkaarjunalingam, mahaakaalEswaralingam,
OnkaarEswaralingam, kEdhaarEswaralingam, bheemEswaralingam,
visvEswaralingam, thryambakEswaralingam, vaidhyanaathEswaralingam,
naagEswaralingam, raamEswaralingam, gusmEswaralingam  are the twelve
jyothirlingas that are the most important ones among the millions of
lingas.  Whosoever thinks of the jyothirlinga will be rid of all his paapas,
he becomes vimukthan  and he attains sarvaabheeshtan.  Because of
dwaathasalingasmaraNam one becomes the beneficiary of aihika aamushmika
sukham.  One who remains nishkaama would never enter maathru kukshi. The
mahimaa of these dwaadhasa lingas cannot be described even by hari, brahma
and other devaas.  If one worships a jyothirlinga for six months his
bhaagyaadhisayam would be indescribable.  The saasthras say that even if one
is born of thaamasa guNa,  when he worships a dwaadhasalinga he will attain
a satkula in the next janma.  Then he becomes a vedhavith and reaches the
lotus feet of Paramasiva.  The same saasthras say that even if one is born
as a mlEccha or a chandaala or a shandana (eunuch), worship of the
dwaadasalingam will bring him a birth as a Brahmana and enable him to attain
mukthi.  Thus it becomes clear that sivalinga dharsanam is most important
for all praaNis.
