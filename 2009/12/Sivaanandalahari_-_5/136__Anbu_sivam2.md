This has two meanings , one relating to a male bee and another the Lord
Shiva.

Let the chief male bee play in the lotus of my mind, the bee which loves to
act in a manner to please the female bee, which drinks the oozing rut from
the elephants, bee which is happy during the shining spring season, which
sings with its black body, which was supported by Cupid, which is deeply
interested in the flower gardens, which resides in the beautiful mountain,
and which can fly anywhere.

Let the Lord Shiva who is fond of dancing to the tune of Bringhi Rishi, Lord
who is the spouse of Bhramarambika, Lord who tamed the elephant king
Gajasura, Lord who was pleased with Vishnu in the form of Mohini, who is
associated with holy sound, who is with a very white body, who aimed his
weapons at cupid, and who is very fond of protecting the Devas and who is
residing in the temple of mount Kailas and all pervading Lord Shiva play in
the lotus of my mind.
