I worship Lord, blue necked peacock like Shiva, who has the sky as the
crest, who wears the king of serpents, Adhisesha, as the necklace, who
initiates, as the peacock making sounds of Ke-Ki, the mantra Om to those who
bow to him in salutation, who, on seeing Parvati attractive like clouds
dances with joy and who loves to play in the garden of Vedanta.

*Commentary

**ya*: = that Paramasiva (that peacock);
aakaasEna = because of aakaasa;
sikhee = locks of hair;
samasthapaNinaam = all the naagas
nEthra = aadhisesha who is the naayaka of them;
kalaapi = who has the ornaments (who has the feathers);
nathaanugraahipraNavOpadhEsaninadhai: = by the praNavadhwani doing anugraham
to those who think of;
kEkee = that which makes the sound kEkaa;
ithi = thus;
geeyathE = one who is praised or sung;
sailasamudhbhavaam = that of parvatha raaja's daughter or that which happens
in the mountain;
ghanaruchim = one who has the complexion of mEgha;
syaamaam = of parvathi;
drushtvaa = looking at;
mudhaa = by the bliss of;
natantham = one who dances;
vEdhanthOpavanE = in the garden of vedantha;
vihaararasikam = one who is intent on the play;
tham = that;
neelakantam = one who has the blue throat;
bhajE = I do worship.

That peacock that has the bun or lock of hair on the head that has the train
of quill and that makes the noise kEkaa that which goes into delirious bliss
at the sight of the the cloud (colored Parvathi) that originates in the
mountain and starts its ecstatic dance in the garden that blue necked one is
the object of my veneration.  In this slEdai one cannot escape notice that
BhagavatpaadhaaL actually is praising Parameswara.

"prapanchOpasamam saantham sivamadhvaitham chadhurtham manyathE"
"Eka Eva rudhrO na dwitheeyaaya thasthE"
"viswam bhootham bhuvanam chithram bhahudhaa jaatham jaayamaanam cha yath |
sarvO hyEsha rudhra: "
"sarvO vai rudhra:"

These are the words of sruthi that declare that there is nothing apart from
Paramasiva.  He who remains sarvavyaapi, who has no beginning or end can
only be described as aakaasa as his head in saguNa roopam.  Accordingly
aachaaryaaL describes him aakaasEna sikhee.  He is wearing aadhisEshan as
his aabharaNam.  He has the praNavadhwani as his blessing for his devotees
who fall at his feet.  Moreover he goes into ecstacy at the very sight of
Parvathi and begins his dance of bliss. And he does so at the end of the
mountain range called the upanishads.  To him AachaaryaaL pays his tribute.
