NamaskArams or salutations to Lord Sambhu, who is eternal, who has the three
Gunas or qualities as his body, who has won over the three cities, who is
the fame of Katyayani, who is embodiment of truth, who is the first to have
a family, who appears I the minds of the sages as personification knowledge,
who defeats the three worlds by Maya, who dances at the end of all the
Vedas, who is fond of dancing in the evening and who has matted hair.

na thvE vaaham jaathu naasam na thvam ne mE janaadhipaa: |
na rchaiva na bhavishyaama: sarvE vayamatha: param ||

says the saasthra.  Accordingly there was no time when sarvEswara was not
and there will be no time when he will not be, what then can we say of the
present!  Thus the vasthu that can have no destruction in the kaalathrayam
called the past, the present and the future is called Nithya vasthu.  Vasthu
means poruL.  So that paramporuL is none other than ParamEswara!

That Parameswara with sathwa guna remains as Vishnu swaroopan, with rajO
guna remains as Brahma swaroopan and with thamO guna as rudhra swaroopan and
keeps doing srishti, sthithi and layam.  Also he does dhwamsam of the three
sareeras called sthula, sookshma and kaaraNa sareeras.  Moreover in respect
of the praaNis who are governed by the sabhdham called 'I' (aham, naan) he
teaches them aathma thathwa.  Moreover he remains the phala swaroopi of
Parvathi's thapas.  Besides he, cutting across the three kaalas remains the
void  (thrikaala paricchedha soonyan).  At the same time he shines as the
sathya swaroopan and rakshaanukooli of sakala praaNis in the chathurdasa
lOkas.  Thus with Parvathi he remains the maatha and pithaa of all the
lOkas.

And indeed he is the brilliant gnaanaswaroopi in the minds of those
munijanas in their samaadhi.   And he keeps the three lOkas created by the
maaya as his body.  This mahEswara of the mahaa mahima roams on the sikharam
of the upanishads of the Vedas. Added to that he who did garvabhangam of the
Ganga, he who created the all powerful veerabhadra to destroy the yagna of
dhaksaprajaadhipathi shows his gaambeeryam with his jataa. As if these are
not enough, he is fond of dancing in the evening to do anugraham to the
bakthas.

To such a mangalaswaroopi Sambu let my namaskaarams be.

Sambo MahaadEva!
