*Sivaanandalahari - 50 (4)

*(continued from 50 (3))

As Bhagavathpaadhaal says:

praatharlinga mumaapathE: aharaha: sandharshaNaath swargatham
madhyaahnE hayamEvathulyaphalavam saayanthanE mOkshatham |
bhaanOrasthamayE pradhOsha samayE panchaakshararaadhanam
thathkaalathrayathulyam ishtaphaladham sadhyOnavadhyam nruNaam ||

if anyone has dharsanam of Sivalingam in the morning he attains swargalOka,
when he has dharsanam during noon time he will attain brahmalOka and if he
has the dharshanam of sivalingam in the evening he will attain mOksham.  By
doing sivapanchaaksharee dhyaanam and having dharsanam of sivalingam during
the sooryaasthamana time known as pradhOsham he will attain the benefit of
all the three kaala dharshanam.

KaaLIdaasa in his megadhootham describes the mahima of sivalinga dharsanam
as follows:

apyanyasminjaladhara mahaakaalamaasaadhya kaalE
sthaathavya thE nayanavishayam yaavadhathyEthibhaanu: |
kurvansandhyaabalipatahathaam soolina: slaadhyaneeyaam
aamandhraaNaam phalamavikalam lapsyasE gharjithaanaam ||

"Hey! MeghamE!  if you happen to reach Ujjayini the abode of
mahaakaalEswaram before sooryaasthamanam, wait there till the sun sets.  My
kaaryam (of having to deliver my message of love to my kaamini) is not
important.  When the sandhyaakaala akhanda pooja of mahaakaaleswaram is
taking place just make a small roaring garjana and it will bring sabalam to
your janma.  This is most important!"

In this stanza of Sivaanandalahari Sri bhagavatpaadhaaL suggests that among
the dwaadhasalingas Sri Mallikaarjunalingam is the most important one!
Therefore anyone who keeps Mallikaarjuna Mahaalingam in his hrudhaya
pundareekam and says this slOka and do a namaskaaram in siva sannidhi will
attain sakala srEyas.  This is the truth.  This is the truth.

Aum Namasivaaya.
