I prostrate before you, Lord Shambu, considering that you were there before
the Vedas, you are lustrous beyond limits, known by the words of Vedas,
capable of being invoked in the idols, are in the form of knowledge and
bliss, keenly motivated in protecting the three worlds, meditated upon by
all yogis or saints, sung and praised by the associates of Devas, you
control the Maya or illusion, deeply interested in the dance of Tandava, has
matted hair and is the personification of all that is good.

Hey! ParamEswara! How can I describe your swaroopa mahimai?

the sruthis,

sadhEva sowmya idham agrE aaseeth | ekamEvaadhvitheeyam brahma,

and

ahamEvaasa mEvaagrE naanyathyathsadhasathparam |
paschaadhaham yadhEthascha yOvasishyaham ||

say of only you as the one who is before jagathsrishti.  From this it is
clear that everything has been created from you, protected by you and
ultimately they all find layam in you.  That you remain prior to everything.

thasya bhaasaa sarvamidham vibhaathi

You are excelling all the jyOthis as the limitless luminence.  Of such great
eminence of you can be known only through the sabhdam of rig vEdha, yajur
vEdha, saama vEdha and atharvaNa vEdha.
