During the spring season, in the garden of the heart, the old leaves of sin
fall off, cluster of the creepers of Bhakti ( devotion) shine beautifully,
leaves of Punya ( good actions) sprout, the buds of virtues, the flowers of
meditation and utterance of mantras, the fragrance of goodness, the flood of
honey like ambrosia of the joy of knowledge and the fruit of experience of
knowledge glow.

In this slOka the mind is compared to a garden if only Sambhu's dhyaanam is
kept in there.  How will the garden be with the dhyaanam of Sambu?  It will
be like the one in vasantha ruthu where you see the dried up leaves of
paapa, the shining leaves and new shooting leaves called punYa, the creepers
called bhakthi, the flower buds called guNa, the flowers themselves called
japa, the sweet smell called the karmas, the flood of makarantham called
gnaanam, aanandam and amritham and finally the fruit called the
brahmagnaanam.  (I am reminded of Thyagaraja Bhagavathar's old song "வசந்த
ருது மனமோஹனமே!)

According to the saasthra 'bahoonaam janmanaamanthE sivabhakthi:
prajaayathE' sambhudhyaanam takes place only when one has done puNyas in
innumerable births. Not at all with one or two janmas.  Because of such
mountain of punyas the vasantha ruthu called sambhudhyaanam takes place in
the praaNi's garden called the mind. when that happens, the paapas accruing
from the fault of non-performance of nithya karmas and those gathered by the
performance of nishiddha karmas are uprooted and destroyed.  Because of this
the praaNi's become prone to doing those punya karmas that are of shining
nature. Moreover they become disposed to bhakthi maarga. They become
possesed of such guNas as speaking the truth, doing dharma, conforming to
aachaaram, performing karmas sanctioned by the sruthi etc.  Moreover they do
mahaamanthra japam and chant loudly of manthra's swaroopam in their slOkas.
And in the end they enjoy sivaanandham that lets out the pravaaham of the
rasas such as gnaanam, aanandham and amrutham.  The root cause of all these
is only sambhudhyaanam.

Also let us enjoy the swaarasyam of the varNana of showing the mind as the
garden and the bhakthi as the creeper.  By showing the mind as the garden we
reckon that the garden is one but the creepers there are many.  So it is
clear that there are many creepers and each of them expands exponentially.

Wen the vasantha ruthu called sambhudhyaanam takes place in the mind there
is an explosion of the creepers called bhakthi.  Sometimes these
sambhudhyaanaparas would be serving mahaans;  sometimes they may be drinking
sivaamrutham;  sometimes they may be visiting the kshethras to have
dharsanam of mangala vigrahas;  sometimes they be doing sivaarchanas and
sometimes they may be doing saashtaanga namaskaaram in lingamoorthy's
sannidhi.  These are the many ways of the bhakthi they may resort to.  In
the end they have their layam in Paramasiva.

Anyone who says this sloka and do namaskaaram in Sivasannidhi will find
their mind attaining its layam in Siva.

Aum Namasivaya.
