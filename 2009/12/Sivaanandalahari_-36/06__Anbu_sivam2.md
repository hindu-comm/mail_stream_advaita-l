Oh God who is with Goddess Parvati, I am your devotee, bound by the thread
of Bhakti, with the vessel of my mind full of water of happiness and
brightness, with your two holy feet as the Mango leaves on the vessel, with
the coconut of GyAna (the ultimate truth) placed over the leaves, meditating
on the Panchakshari (five letter) mantra which grows the Satva Guna and thus
I do the Punyahavachanam (purification) with a view to cleansing the house
of my mind and yearning for all the good.

He! SambO! As your bhaktha I wish to clean my body of impurities; I wish to
get sukham to my frittering mind and I wish to prepare myself to enjoy
mokshasukham so I am doing this karma called 'punyaaham' with due deligence.
That is, Hey! Sarveswara! I have made my nirmala manas as a pot which I have
filled with the water that is Aananda. The mango leaves that is half
submerged in the water are your lotus feet along with the coconut called
gnaanam sitting on it. I have tied it with the thread called bhakthi. I am
doing this karma called 'punyaaham' chanting the panchaakshari manthra 'Aum
Nama: Sivaaya'. Hey! PrabhO! I have no doubt that by doing this karma I will
get nithyamoksham.

சிவ சிவ என்கிலர் தீவினையாளர்
சிவ சிவ என்றிடத் தீவினைமாளும்
சிவ சிவ என்றிடத் தேவருமாவர்
சிவ சிவ என்னச் சிவகதி தானே.
(திருமந்திரம்)

Aum Nama: Sivaaya.

Raja yoga is considered mukyam in this sloka.
