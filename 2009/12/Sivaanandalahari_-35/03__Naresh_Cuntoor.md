Anbu ji,

Thanks for the series

Not to nitpick, but among the three important words that you pointed out ...

> His dhayaa cannot be subject to any pariNaamam in the pravrthi such as

Let us hope there is no 'dhaya' going on.. No straws to suck on here :)

> as my *Paramaanandharangan*.

While it is true that we may be 'andhenaiva nIyamAnAH yathAndhAH ...',
in the present shloka there are no blind men. No andha, but 'anta'.

PS: I take your point about typos. But I pointed these out because I
have heard many people mispronouncing these letters.
