Dear Sri Shakthi Prashanth
If one looks at the outside world one can not but notice intelligence.What
is intelligence?If you follow this thread you will come to a conclusion that
there should be some super intelligent being who is behind all this
phenomenon.The totality of all coceivable intelligence can be the
intelligence of the Brahman.Then you ask why this creation?Advaitha says
there is no creation as such but whatever is felt/observed/experienced is
all Brahman only. But we are seeing Its presence differently because of our
ignorance.Mithya  denotes that all this which we are experiencing  is
everchanging.It is like a
dream.Who created a dream and why a dream etc are still under
analysis.Lastly it cannot be taught like a physical science.You have to
think,analyse and get hold of a Guru who will appear before you if you are
sincere in your pursuit of this Truth.You try sincerely and I assure you you
will get all the answers.The difficulty is sanskrit words have very deep
meaning and the other equivalents either in English/Tamil may not give the
correct import.But a shraddhavan and  a seeker of truth for Truth`s sake 
will get all his answers from Advaitha.

Thanks Sriram.

Who created this entire universe? (Jagath).
In encyclopedia they have written that
"It is an accidental creation. No body created it literally."

By definition Accident is not "something which happens without any reason."
It is "something which happens with a reason that we do not know!"

So, if that is the case, this universe has not evolved on itself. Someone
has created it. And if Brahman is the only entity that exists, then he has
created it.

Why do Brahman create Mithya Jagath first of all? Is he magician?
What is basic reason/principle behind in creating so called Mithya Jagath.
If Brahman is great, then whatever he creates must also be Great.

If a scientist creates a computer, then we respect for his creation. The
respect what you give to computer , the scientist deserves it.

So, why do we call this Jagath (universe) as Mithya?????

Shakthi

Dear Sri Shakthi Prashanth
The sruthi vakyam you have presented simply says you are the one without a
second.That is every conceivable thing by your Indhriyas and Intellect is
Brahman and Brahman alone.It is our ignorance that we see differently by
giving names,figures and places.First of all we have doubt whether there is
a one called Brahman.The sruthi is the pramana like a mother telling the
child this is your father.Sruthi says athatha Brahma Jingyasah.That is let
us contemplate on Brahman.One will contemplate on something that should be
there.Sruthi says It is there and let us analyse /find out.I am unable to
give the correct import of Jingyasam.So after logical reasoning and
supported by the sruthi vakyas one is led to the conclusion that this Jagath
is just mithya and Brahman alone is sathyam and Brahman is adhvidiyam.That
is it is the only Truth and all other things we experince are asath.To
understand this profound Truth is not that easy.By just saying that I am
King I
 cannot be a King.You wi
 ll now know what is it that goes with a King.So also the sruthi asserts
that All are Brahman only and you and i included.But the qualities of
Brahman are also given in the sruthi.In essence Brahman is not an object of
perception yet could be known.By sincerity and shraddha and by sruthi`s
guidance you can yourself understand what is meant by Aham Brahmasmi.This is
not a simple sentence to interpret it by tracing it etymologically.It is to
be contemplated again and again till one is satified that it is only so.Some
subjective experiences can not be verbally described.When one says I am
happy and another also says I am happy there can be no comparison of these
two happinesses.R.Krishnamoorthy
