Dear Shakthi,

I had the same question in my early days and could not resolve this. The
problem is with the general interpretation of the word Mithya. In many
indian languages, this is interpreted as "false" or "lie". But when Vedanta
says that the world is false, it does not mean that it does not exist. It
only says that it does not have independent existence other than Brahman. It
is a superimposition on Brahman that is the sat(existence), chit
(awareness), ananda (bliss).

The right word in English I used to reconcile Mithya is the word "apparent".
If we interpret Mithya as "apparent" things seem to fall in place (at least
to our "intelligent" minds). Then it becomes clear that the world appears as
real but is not always the case. It disappears when we are dreaming and are
in deep sleep. It is only pure consciousness that exists in all three states
and can stand on own without depending on anything else.

The key is to understand the context of the words used in Vedanta and not
use our existing interpretations. It is no different than science. When in
physics, we hear the word "rest" we intuitively interpret it as something
that does not move. This colloquially is correct but fails for  more
advanced concepts. An object could be moving and still be at "rest" with
relation to something else. The entire foundation of relativity rests on
this understanding. Which is why we cannot use common place understanding of
words to interpet the statements in the Shruti (or Science for that matter).

Unfortunately, words are the only means to express ideas and Shruti/Science
also has to do so. Shruti is therefore called the "Shabda Pramana"). The key
is to however have shradda in the shruti/science and reject all our notions
that do not fall in line with the shruti and refine our understanding until
things reconcile. Otherwise, we are a permanent skeptic/agnostic that
remains on the sidelines.

The shraddha aspects does exist in science also but is not so key because we
can experimentally verify it. I can see the same things you can see and we
can agree. With Vedanta however, we are dealing with things that is beyond
the mind and intellect and cannot be objectified. This is because the
subject (body/mind/intellect) and object are subsumed in the Jagat and
cannot therefore "understand" Brahman. This is where shraddha becomes the
corner stone to the contemplation process.

Does this help?

Pranams.
