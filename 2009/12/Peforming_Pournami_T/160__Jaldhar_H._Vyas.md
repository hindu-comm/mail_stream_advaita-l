First of all my condolences for your loss.  May krpa nidhi Parameshvara 
comfort you at this trying time.

Secondly I should mention that I am Gujarati.  Although the dictates of 
shruti and smrti are the same for both of us, shistachara may be 
different.  If so, I request South Indian list members to make any 
necessary corrections.  (If you do so, please cc Satishji directly as he 
is not a member of the list.)

Having said that, yes during mrtaka (the period after the death of a close 
relative) we must suspend all auspicious activities.  However there are 
some exceptions.  For example nitya karma such as sandhyavandana must be 
continued.  Or if you have undertaken a vrata and it is already in 
progress, it is not suspended because of mrtaka-sutaka.  Also this 
prohibition applies to devakarya (puja to Gods) not pitrakarya (puja to 
ancestors) as you are observing.  So my opinion is it is the right thing 
to continue as you are doing.
