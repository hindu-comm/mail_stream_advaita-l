Dear Sathish Shanmugasundaram
It is better to get advice from your Purohit in this matter of things.As you 
have to observe masikam and sotha kumbam every month till your father`s 
annual srardham as the kartha and in the absence of information as to who 
has to perform your uncle`s karyam in my opinion -I am  a Southindian 
smartha Brahmin-you can carry on with whatever you have chosen to do to 
remember your dear father on the monthly thithi..R.Krishnamoorthy.

> that we stay in a separate house and my father's brother stayed in a 
> separate house for more than 45 years and continue to do so.
