Truth both Vyavaharika and Paramarthika deserve respect.

(Ribu Gita)

Advaita in the form of Sri Adhi Sankaracharia has no dvaitham and time and space has no existence. The potent content of his teachings is more to contemplate rather than HIS time of birth and death. They are just points of discussion,dispute and meat for historical research either way or any way as 'bahirmuka vaadham'. 
Do we want more inner paralysis by analysis of Sri Shankara's birth time and mukthi time in history?. It may add more referential knowledge wealth, be it right or wrong and has no other sathyam.
