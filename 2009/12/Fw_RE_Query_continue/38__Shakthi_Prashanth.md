Thank you Bhaskar for ur answer.
I need a clarification.

If I am saying that I am brahman, you also say the same. But how many will say like this?
And more over does this universe contains only Brahmans? 
Is Brahman a living entity or non-living?
If it is living entity, then he/she/it may realize at some point of time what is the truth?
But according to ur statement, there is no world apart from you.
So how those non-living entities realise the truth, as they are also Brahman.

question if I am Brahman, then who is controlling my birth, death, this
world, life, and infinite no. of activities that are happening?
And suppose we assume that I am Brahman, then By etymology I am
 Greatest. So am I controlling everything?

I think you are asking same 'age old' questions to advaitins :-)) Before 
posing any question to the forum, my sincere advice is to atleast read the 
archieved mails with appropriate words in the search engine . 

To your above question, in short, if you are realized that you are 
brahman, then you would come to know that you have no birth, death & there 
is no world apart from YOU...Problem arises only and only if you are under 
the spell of ignorance that you are mere tiny body with a prANa in this 
vast universe :-)) Kindly note, as per advaita 'you are brahman' is not 
mere assumption, it is the ultimate truth, that which we are all 
struggling to realize :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
