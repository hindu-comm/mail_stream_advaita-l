Dear Shakhti --

Since the prabhujis are all telling you that You are yourself Brahman, it
looks as if only you can answer your own questions *!*

So how to go about that ?

How about a dose of Ramana Maharshi ?

Just ask yourself 'WHO is this I, who is not convinced by Bhaskarji's answer
?!' And stay with that question until...

Best of luck with that ;)

Michael

Sorry Bhaskar, I am not convinced with your answer.

Sorry for wasting your time...As I told you, you can wait for more
convincing answers from the learned prabhuji-s of this group.  Till then..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
