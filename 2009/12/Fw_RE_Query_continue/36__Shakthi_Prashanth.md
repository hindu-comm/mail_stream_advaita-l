Hi All,

Thank you so much for such a great response from all of you.

But I have also heard an interpretation like this:

"Aham Brahmasmi"
ham - means reject-able      [in Sanskrit.]
Aham - means Non-reject-able [in Sanskrit.]
Brahma - Greatest [in Sanskrit.]

So, it comes to a conclusion that,
The one which is Non-reject-able is the Greatest.

But that is not Me. Because, Narayanopanishat says
 that,
Padmakosha prateekasham hrudayachapyatho mukham
Tasyaanthe suhiram sookhmam tasmin sarvam pratishtitam

That means, 
There is just-born lotus flower being held inverted [pointing to heart], 
and there is pin point space in it which is omnipotent.

My
question if I am Brahman, then who is controlling my birth, death, this
world, life, and infinite no. of activities that are happening?
And suppose we assume that I am Brahman, then By etymology I am
 Greatest. So am I controlling everything?


Please answer this. I am very thirst to know about it.
