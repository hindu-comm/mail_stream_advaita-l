question if I am Brahman, then who is controlling my birth, death, this
world, life, and infinite no. of activities that are happening?
And suppose we assume that I am Brahman, then By etymology I am
 Greatest. So am I controlling everything?

I think you are asking same  'age old' questions to advaitins :-))  Before 
posing any question to the forum, my sincere advice is to atleast read the 
archieved mails with appropriate words in the search engine . 

To your above question, in short, if you are realized that you are 
brahman, then you would come to know that you have no birth, death & there 
is no world apart from YOU...Problem arises only and only if you are under 
the spell of ignorance that you are mere tiny body with a prANa in this 
vast universe :-))  Kindly note, as per advaita 'you are brahman' is not 
mere assumption, it is the ultimate truth, that which we are all 
struggling to realize :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
