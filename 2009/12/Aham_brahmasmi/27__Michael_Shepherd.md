Well, technically it's a pronominal suffix, like 'atman-' can be a
pronominal prefix. It's there in Vedic. It can be used in two ways : as in
'The king cut himself while shaving' or 'The king himself joined in the
battle'. One is directing one's actions to oneself; the other is emphatic.

But I think we get the point : if you think of yourself first, you're
Brahman; if you think of Brahman first -- that's you !

Incidentally 'asmi' is still found in Romanian in this form.. Romanians
alleged to be migrating Indian gipsies in origin...

'Myself' is an extraneous term, not found in the mahavakya. Asmi is exactly
the equivalent of 'am' in 'I am Brahman' and 'is' in 'Brahman is I'.

It is not as idiomatic in English but adding "myself" is more literal.  It
is a reflexive verb.  The sentence is not just saying "I am Brahman" but
also "Brahman is I"
