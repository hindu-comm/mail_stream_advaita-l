You could just as grammatically say aham brahmam (or brahmo'ham) and get 
the meaning "I am Brahman".  The translation of the particular 
construction in Sanskrit is helped by the addtional word "myself" because 
English has largely lost it.  But in e.g. French you could say "Je me suis 
Brahman" to get an accurate translation.
