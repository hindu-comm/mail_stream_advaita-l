'Myself' is an extraneous term, not found in the mahavakya. Asmi is exactly the equivalent of 'am' in 'I am Brahman' and 'is' in 'Brahman is I'.

It is not as idiomatic in English but adding "myself" is more literal.  It 
is a reflexive verb.  The sentence is not just saying "I am Brahman" but 
also "Brahman is I"
