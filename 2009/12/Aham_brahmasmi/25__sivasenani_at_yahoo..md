Etymologically aham meaning self is as basic as it gets; to my knowledge you cannot go beyond the simple statement 'aham means self'. Brahman is from the root bri, to expand; Brahman is that  which has expanded. 

Epistemologically, Veda is the pramana and to many that is sufficient. Aham Brahmasmi being a part of Veda is true on its own account without any need for further substantiation. For those who want to do thought experiments the avasthatraya prakriya establishes that the Self is Brahman. Pl refer to the Mandukya Upanishad and the Karikas thereof for the details of the thought experiment. 

Exegetically, the Brahma Sutras in the very first chapter or book establish that sixteen words are used in the Vedas to mean Brahman.

I am Brahman

On hearing this, the sadhaka must begin pondering what is meant by "I" and 
"Brahman"
