You are of course correct, but if I'm not mistaken, Shakthi is regurgitating (without clear understanding) the dvaitin interpretation of the Mahavakya, where even the straightforward term "asmi" is split up into strange and unrecognizable components:

i) 'aham brahmaasmi'

Now, the word 'aham' in "aham brahmaasmi" does not mean "I" -- it
means "aheyam" -- that which cannot be avoided, that which is not to
be given up. The word 'asmi' does not mean "I am" but is a compound of
"as" meaning existence, and "mi" meaning knowable.

...

Thus, "aham brahma asmi" means: "That Brahman which cannot be avoided
