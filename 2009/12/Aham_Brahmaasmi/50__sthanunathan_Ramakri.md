Dear Shakthi,

            I have one problem with your interpretation. I do not know if "ham" means rejectable. But assuming it is, the statement should be 
"Aham Brahma Asthi" (to get the meaning you intend, that is the "Non Rejectable is the greatest") and not "Aham Brahma Asmi", because "Asmi" is in the first person and "Asthi" would be in the third person. 

   Folks, Please correct me if Iam wrong. Iam just taking my baby steps in learning sanskrit.

regards
Sthanu
