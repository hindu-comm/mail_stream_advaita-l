Sorry for the late reply.  I have a large backlog of emails to attend to.

I did not mean to imply that asmi is a pronomial suffix.  It is a verb as 
you say.  It is in modern English (and Middle English too I think) that 
the pronoun is used to convey this meaning because English has lost the 
Indo-European case system (Old English or Anglo-Saxon had it though.)

The difference between brahmasmi, aham brahma and brahmo'ham is stylistic. 
In Vedic, the first form is preferred to convey a reflexive sense.
