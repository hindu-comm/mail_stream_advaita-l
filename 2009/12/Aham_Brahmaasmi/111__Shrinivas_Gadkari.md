Namaste,

On can also possibly interpret aham brahma asmi as:
aham(kAra) is brahma.

So we have:
1. prajnA is brahma (Rgveda)
2. ahamkAra is brahma (yajurveda)
4. this body (AtmA interpreted as body) is brahma (atharvaveda)
3. One would expect a statement saying : manaH (mind)is brahma. 
But what we have instead is "tat tvam asi" in sAma veda. 

Regards,
Shrinivas
