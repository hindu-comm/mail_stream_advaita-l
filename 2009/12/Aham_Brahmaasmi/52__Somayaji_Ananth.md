I see another issue with this : Assuming that aham is an adjective qualification to Brahman, it brings about the existence of another Brahman albeit Ham-Brahman. It would bring about duality inside Mahavakya. Thoughts ? The other things to consider is that in none of the other Mahavakyas we have any adjective to the Brahman : Tatvamasi, Pragyanam Brahma etc. Can some one correct me if I am wrong ?

well sir,
first take the sentence
brahma asmi
that is  a mahavakya complete and accurate in itself. the verb 'asmi'
 implies  the first person singular anyway even without 'aham'

now therefore aham can be taken as an adjective qualifying brahma since both
the words aham and brahma are  neuter singular nouns.

therefore  it aham-brahma asmi isgrammaticaly ok. athough the interpretation
itself is something novel. i have never come across it.
