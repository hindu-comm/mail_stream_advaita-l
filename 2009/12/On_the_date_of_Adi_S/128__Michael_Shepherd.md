Sri Srikanta,

I find that very interesting. It is not normally mentioned in commentaries
that affirm Gaudapada as the effective founder, in his Mandukya Karika, of
Advaita Vedanta concepts as passed down to us -- with Adi Shankara's own
reservations.

Do the Buddhist texts reveal anything more about Gaudapada which is relevant
to Hinduism ?

Regards,
Michael

with reference to the above,many karikas of Acharya Gaudapada is quoted in
the Buddhist Texts,especially by Santarakshita.These have been quoted by
them to their rival schools.
