Dear Vyasji,

Does "Vivekakhyati" of Yogasutras not imply Sankhya?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

But is the yoga mentioned in the Gita and Puranas the same as the yoga in the yogasutras? As we have previously discussed in the list, at the earliest stage, saMkhya and yoga are merely generic terms for "theory" and "practice" Every reference to them in the most ancient sources need not refer to the full-blown classical dogma of samkhya/yoga.
