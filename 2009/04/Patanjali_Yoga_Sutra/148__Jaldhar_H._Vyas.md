But is the yoga mentioned in the Gita and Puranas the same as the yoga in 
the yogasutras?  As we have previously discussed in the list, at the 
earliest stage, saMkhya and yoga are merely generic terms for "theory" and 
"practice"  Every reference to them in the most ancient sources need not 
refer to the full-blown classical dogma of samkhya/yoga.
