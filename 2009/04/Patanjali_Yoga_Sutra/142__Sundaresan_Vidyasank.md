Dear Sri Bhadraiah,

Firstly, how would svarita affect a putative sandhi? Classical
Sanskrit is not too particular about syllable pitches, unlike
Vedic Sanskrit.

Secondly, even if pitch does change things, who am I to
change the traditionally preserved text of the yogasUtra? 

Regards,
Vidyasankar
