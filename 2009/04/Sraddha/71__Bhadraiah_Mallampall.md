Dear Andreas



To understand any sanskrit word there are two or more methods:



1. Find the etymology for s'ra+dha or more probably s'rat+dha or s'rad+dha. The suffix dha inidcates it is linked to brain/manas/buddhi, similar to medha. We have to understand what the prefix s'ra brings to it. 



The closest word is s'rAddha which is a cremation ceremony. Usually deergha makes a word more extensive or plural or far back into past and far ahead into future. 



2. Meditate on the word itself, it will reveal itself one day. This can take centuries. 



3. Try to guess from the context it is used in.



4. Try sanskrit dictionaries (first nighantu, nirukta then others)



That is all I know about it. 



Regards

Bhadraiah
