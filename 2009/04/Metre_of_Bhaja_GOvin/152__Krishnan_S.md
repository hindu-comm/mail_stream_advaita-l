Advaita Rasikas,



Pranam.



I have a small query which may be outside the scope of the theme of the
e-group. Let me be excused first. Still since I feel that many of you may be
well equipped to answer my query, I am placing this before you hoping for a
‘quick service’



‘MOha mudkaaraH’ alias ‘Bhaja GOvindam’ – In what metre (’vRRiitta’) this
work (supposedly) of Adi shaMkara’ is composed?



Thanks



S. Krishnan
