Bhaskarji,

Chandogya upanishad calls them as the fifth veda and not me please. Mahabharata says that without reading them one should not read the Vedas so they may not be all that any later composition. As itihasa isone of the five essential criteria for the puranas the itihasa portion went on getting updated from time to time. So the antiquity of the puranas is not any lesser than that of the Vedas. There is an ancient verse saying this though I do not recollect that verse right now.

As the Puranas tell us that all the Vedas and the Puranas together were
called Yajurveda before Vedavyasa undertook the division of the Vedas into
the four Vedas and relegated the Puranas as the fifth Veda.

Hare Krishna

History believes that one veda has been divided by vedavyAsa into four
veda-s and written purANas (ashtAdasha - 18 purANa-s) for those who donot
have the adhikAra to do vedAdhyayana & understand the same...I dont think
there is any mention that purANa-s have co-existed with veda-s even before
the division!! that is the reason why vedic saMpradAya believes veda is
aparusheya and smruti & purANa etc. are paurusheya texts...Calling purANa-s
as fifth veda is just an acclamation :-) AFAIK, Ayurveda, music etc. also
will come under this fifth veda category..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
