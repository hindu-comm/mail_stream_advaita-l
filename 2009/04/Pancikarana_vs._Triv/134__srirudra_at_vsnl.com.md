Dear Members
Our Rishis were searching for the Truth or Brahman absolutely believing that there should be such an one,whereas Newton`s discovery was quite accidental.Newton was not searching for Gravitational force and he fumbled on it.Ofcourse he used deductive reasoning and came to the conclusion that there is a force exerted by the earth on all its denizens.Almost all scientific discoveries were quite accidental.But our Maharishis were having unshakable faith that there should be something responsible for the creation of the Universe as we see it and the laws governing its functions.So in their 24x7 meditations they revealed the truths as and when they saw it.Nethi nethi is the chisel they used to unravel that Brahman is only the Sathyam.Some thoughts on Apaureshaya .R.Krishnamoorthy.
