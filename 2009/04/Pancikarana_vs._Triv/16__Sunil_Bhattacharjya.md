Shri Bhaskarji,

You asked good questions and we await the reply from the two learned scholars. However the following statement does not really reflect the advaitic thinking.

Quote

" ---------when srushti prakriya itself ultimately being questioned in advaita??" 

Unquote

Does advaita really question srushti prakriya? Srushti, howsoever impermanent, does take place as Lord Krishna told in the Bhagavad Gita. Advaita to my mind does not derecognise Srushti. Srushti is Vyavaharic Satya and is impermanent (anitya). Ascribing permanence to it is a false notion. Secondly one who has realised Advaita sees unity in the srushti as the ultimate constituents are the same in everything in the world and the constituents are from the same source so these are not different from the source.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Anubhutisvarupacarya, as you may be aware, makes derogatory statements
against Vacaspati like â€˜Mandana prsta-sevi and so on.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Kindly pardon me I am not writing here to contribute anything worthy to the
ongoing discussions between two champions of advaita vedanta..But it is
really agonizing to see the derogatory exchanges between bhAmati & vivaraNa
Acharya-s that too in shankara bhagavatpAda's advaita sampradAya!! Sri SSS
has observed in one of his works that post shankara Acharya-s were not so
friendly among themselves while propagating their respective school's views
& they have squabbled each other at below average level!!...But I did not
know that it is at this level!!

While on the subject, I humbly request either Sri Vidya prabhuji or Sri
Devanathan prabhuji to educate us briefly about what exactly is
paNchikaraNa and trivrtkaraNa ?? what are the implications of these two
methodologies in advaita siddhAnta nirNaya in general & srushti prakriya in
particular?? and also let the readers know how
favouring/supporting/believing in any one of these two systems would hamper
one's path of brahma jignAsa...Is it so necessary to make it a big issue
when srushti prakriya itself ultimately being questioned in advaita??

I've Sri Vidya prabhuji's paNchikaraNa article with me but in that article
I dont think he has touched these questions in detail.

Kindly pardon me for this digression..My intention is not to pick later
Acharya-s in tradition, but it is painful to note our advaita acharya-s
have gone to such low level in an effort of advocating their siddhAnta !!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
