Dear Bhadraiah-Ji

The name "romasha" as mentioned is correct.

This suukta is known as "svanaya daanasuti". R^iShii for this suukta is kaxiivat aushija, King full name is given as "svanaya bhavayavya" and chhanda for the reference R^ichaa 6 & 7 is anuShTubh. 

Regards,

Dr. Yadu

The word romasha is suspect in the first place. 



If something (hair in private parts) can not be explained by Shruti that becomes not_Brahman right? Can such a thing exist?

Bhadraiah
