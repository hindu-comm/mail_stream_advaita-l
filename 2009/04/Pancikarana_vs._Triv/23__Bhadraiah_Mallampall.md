Just to clarify my points, 



- What your teacher taught is the customized Shruti for you. Other Shrutis are like ERP packages 

you buy off the shelf. 



- You do not always proclaim what you heard from your teacher as a Shruti to rest of the world, 

unless your teacher authorized you to do so. Obviously you wouldn't forge your teachers' signature 

if he hadn't himself claimed his own teaching as a Shruti, would you?



- You are not doing a favor to your teacher or any Rishi by calling something he said or another 

Rishi said as Shruti. You are just speaking the truth. 



Regards

Bhadraiah
