As the Puranas tell us that all the Vedas and the Puranas together were
called Yajurveda before Vedavyasa undertook the division of the Vedas into
the four Vedas and relegated the Puranas as the fifth Veda.

History believes that one veda has been divided by vedavyAsa into four
veda-s and written purANas (ashtAdasha - 18 purANa-s) for those who donot
have the adhikAra to do vedAdhyayana & understand the same...I dont think
there is any mention that purANa-s have co-existed with veda-s even before
the division!!  that is the reason why vedic saMpradAya believes veda is
aparusheya and smruti & purANa etc. are paurusheya texts...Calling purANa-s
as fifth veda is just an acclamation :-)  AFAIK, Ayurveda, music etc. also
will come under this fifth veda category..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
