Dear Sri Srinivas,
Namaste.

As Sri Michel ji said, atmaka means meaning 'of the nature of -- the Self'.

trigunaAtmaka is an adjective for something else.  You may have to let
me know so that I can explain the meaning of the same.  For example,
in Vedanta Saara, there is one definition for ajnana.  It goes like
this.

"ajnaanam tu sadasadbhyam anirvachaniiyam triguNaatmakam jnanavirodhi......"

Here, triguNaatmakam is used to qualify or define or suggest what ajnana is.

ajnana is "of the nature of" three gunas. That is the meaning.

Gramatical:

atma + Thanj pratyaya = atmaka

There are many many taddhita pratyayas.  One such is Thanj.  These
taddhita pratyayas, when added with other nouns, give some special
meaning.  The Special meaning conferred by Thanj pratyaya is
"constructed by" or "made of".

Other examples are:
satva + Thanj = saatvika
