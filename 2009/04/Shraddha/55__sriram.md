Dear Members
In the Gita17th Chapter Sri Krishna tells  Sri Arjuna about three types of Shraddha .He says that for the embodied Shraddha is based on his three gunas-sathvikam,rajasam and thamasam.In the earlier chapter He just said one should strictly follow the injunctions of the  Shastras in deciding what is right to do and what is not right to do.Naturally Arjuna immediately puts the question about people who deviate from injunctions of  Shastras but do things with Shraddha what is their position.If one goes through the entire chapter one will know what exactly is Shraddha.Shraddha means doing or observing things according to Shastras only and devoid of faith in the shatras`injunctions doing things meticulously for show etc  will not be sat.Sat means always existing and always good.R.Krishnamoorthy.
