Dear All,
One of the founders of Samskrit Bharati, Sri Krishna Shastry, is giving a talk on April 7th at Univ of Maryland, College Park. (Most likely you know him so I will spare the introduction here.) More details are attached below.

Please mark your calendars & invite friends and relatives.

On behalf of DESI & UMD samskritam,
Ashutosh.

Subject: Why Sanskrit in the Modern World?: A talk by Sri Krishna Shastry
Sanskrit trivia: 
Indo-European cognates of the word "Mouse" (from west to east!)
Latin mūs ->Albanian mī -> Ancient Greek μῦς (mūs) -> Old Church Slavonic мъішь (myšĭ) -> Russian мышь (myš) ->Armenian մուկ (mouk) -> Persian موش (mush) ->Sanskrit मूष् (mūṣ)

Language not only connects people, but it also connects their civilizations & histories; their exchange, evolution and expression is imprinted in their language. 
As the world enters a space age, what is the relevance of a language from pre-historic times? 
Please join DESI & UMD Samskritam for a talk by Sri Krishna Shastry, one of the founders of famed educational institute Samskrit Bharati, on relevance of Sanskrit in 21st century. 

Speaker: Sri Cha. Mu. Krishna Shastry
Date: April 7th, 2009
Venue: Room 2168, AV Williams Building, Univ. of Maryland, College Park
Time: 6:30-7:30pm (snacks from 6:15-6:30pm)
