Dear Bhadraiah

I'm asking because I was only told these in English -- so I'm asking for any
authorities..

Yes, the Gayatri for the three worlds (sometimes the subtle world is given
as daivi)

The three loka (which also I don't have names for) were told as I gave in
the example : the universal guna balance as seen through the day e.g. sattwa
in the ascendant at dawn and dusk; the local as the environment you're in at
the time e.g. in the market or the temple; the individual varying from the
dominant-as-born to the moods and thoughts  during the day..

That's the best I can do.. of course, it's all under Brahman and maya and
the individual only needs to fix the heart on the Lord ... but that's no
reason not to ask for source texts..

Michael

Dear Michael

On Feb 2, you mentioned three worlds are physical or material, the mental or
'subtle', and the 'causal' or spiritual.



Shruti has bhUh, bhuvaH ans svaH.

Puranas have brahmalok, vaikunth, and kailash or they also have bhulok,
svargalok and pataal.



The manas-buddhi-ahamkara of Hindu traditions translates to
mind-intelligence-ego (MIE).

I said some swamijis used BMI which is similar to three worlds of west. MIE
and BMI really

don't go together but we are learing to work with the terms.


Now you say:
>The other 'accretion' is the statement that there are >three 'loka'
affecting the balance

>or imbalance of the >guna : universal; local; and personal


What are these three lokas now? Please clarify and give names and
references.

How can the three lokas affect balance or imbalance of gunas?

Does a whole loka adopt one guna? another loka another guna?

One test case may be: A perfect satvic world order, with an rajasic country
in which an ignorant person lives.

I am lost. What is the relevance of this to advaita? Please explain with
examples.



(We do have fourfold practice of dharma: universal, social, family and
personal.

I have no reference for this other than an RSS publication called Bunch of
thoughts.

I believe the idea should have been taken from Mahabharata, which is our
repository

in matters concerning practice of dharma.)



Regards

Bhadraiah
