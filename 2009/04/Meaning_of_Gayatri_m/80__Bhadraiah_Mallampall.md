Also verse 14 quotes another (definitely earlier) text which talked about Time as Brahman. 



'... he who worships time as Brahman, from him time moves away very far (meaning does not control him any more).'  



In the same upanishat, second prapathaka verse 6 and third prapathaka first two verses offer some form of panchikarana.



Regards

Bhadraiah
