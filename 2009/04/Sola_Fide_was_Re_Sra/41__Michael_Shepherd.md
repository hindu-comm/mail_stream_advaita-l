Point well taken, but Kartik's point about translations is also
important.
Christian theologies from various church denominations have different
opinions about the word faith and its role in human salvation. If I am
asked to talk about vedAnta to an audience in the US, I will definitely
be very careful about what words I use in English and in what context.
And given that communication often happens in the English language,
it is worth the extra effort to reiterate other dimensions of the
Sanskrit
words too.

Vidyasankar
