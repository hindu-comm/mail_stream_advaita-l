IMHO, Sradha is well referred in various places on MahA NarAyaNa  
Upanishad.
I quite like the place referred below, where it sequentially  
establishes the Shradha - Chitha shudDhi and Atma Gyanam


In the Gyana sAdhana NirUpaNam  (Establishment of the path to the  
absolute knowledge here)
Quote:

Meaning as by Swami VimalAnanda

Those rays by which the sun gives heat, the same rays transform water  
into rain-cloud, which showers the rain.
By the rain-cloud, herbs and trees come into existence.  From herbs  
and trees food is produced.
By the use of food, the breaths and senses are nourished.  When the  
life-breath is nourished, one gets bodily strength.

Bodily strength gives the capacity to practice tapas (in the shape of  
self-control, austerity etc.).
As the result of such tapas,  faith in scriptural truths and in Guru's  
teachings springs into existence.
By this faith mental power is obtained.
By mental power, sense-control is made possible.
By sense-control, reflection is engendered.
 From reflection calmness of mind results.
Conclusive experience of Truth follows calmness.
By conclusive experience of Truth remembrance if IT is engendered.
Rememnrance produces continous remembrance.
 From continous remembrance, results unbroken direct realization of  
Truth.
By such realization, a person knows the ATMAN

Sri GurubyO Namaha !!!

Again, one needs Sradha to understand Sradha taking this as PramaNam
