It's this hollow hair-splitting that demotes Christianity (even further) :
imagine 'faith' without hope or love.. You ask God's pardon : as with all
grace, it is beyond the nature of God to refuse; you receive it; then what
happens in the next moment ? You  are confronted by the next required human
action -- which calls for human effort or good works (which of course are
also grace..)..or you reject that grace. Where's the difference ? Wikipedia
wasn't written by God... ;)

That is NOT the case according to the definition of "Faith" in the Christian
context:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_fide

  "The doctrine of sola fide or "faith alone" asserts God's pardon for
  guilty sinners is granted to and received through faith or belief alone,
  TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL HUMAN EFFORTS OR WORKS."

The above implies that one can have "Faith" WITHOUT any effort or action.
The example from Ramana Maharshi shows that Sraddha is deeply entwined with
and NEVER decoupled from human effort and action. In fact, according to
Ramana Maharshi, the Grace of God cannot be obtained without Effort!

All terms such as "God", "Salvation", "Faith", etc. are primarily used in
the English language in the Christian context, and we should be very careful
before lifting them and placing the same in the Vedanta context!
