Dear Michaelji,



>But it still remains a miracle of the Lord !


There is no need for miracles. Sense organs like eyes, ears were explained as products of

interactions of devas in Ai.Br, but the nuts & bolts of this technology is now lost. 

We can still get some good clues, from high level relationships available in upanishats 

like ears being equated to quarters because sound is heard from different directions. 

Likewise you can get clues about other organs and senses. 



Maya is not miracle. It is just a forgotten relationship that you once already knew

and/or it will resolve some time in future. 



Regards

Bhadraiah
