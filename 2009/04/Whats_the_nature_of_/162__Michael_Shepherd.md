Suresh,

This question of the 'moment of crossover' from outer to inner has occupied
every culture. It was covered recently on this site under cid-aabhaasa. But
it still remains a miracle of the Lord !

Michael

Subject: [Advaita-l] What's the nature of the sense organs?




Friends,

We obtain information about the world from the sense organs. For instance,
certain objects appear in a certain color, shape etc. due to our human eyes.
The same objects appear differently for the bee, which has got a different
vision (polaroid?). Suffice it to say that the objects have no reality apart
from the information that the senses provide.

So one might as well conclude that the forms are only due to senses, and
everything is inherently formless and without qualities.

But what of the senses themselves? The objects can be negated, but how to
negate the sense organs? Else, advaita wouldn't be complete, because we'd
still be stuck with forms.

Suresh
