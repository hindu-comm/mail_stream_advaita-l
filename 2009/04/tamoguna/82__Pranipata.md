Hari Om Shri Michaelji,  Pranaams!

The gunAs(sAttvic, rajasic & tAmasic) are considered the power of Ishvara 
hence called divine. -- eshA mama mAyA gunamayI daivI. (BG 7.14).

The sampad(daiva, Asura, rAkSasa) are nature of beings (more specifically 
human beings) having the nature of (sattva, rajas and & tAmasic in that 
order) and are the cause for adhering to or acting against 
dharma(worshipping and not worshipping the lord). -- (BG 9.11&12)

I do not think any other creature other than human beings are fit to be 
classified under above nature because they do not have any choice of 
adhering to or acting against dharma. (They do not have free-will).


In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
