Shri Sadananda,

May  I try your patience further on this matter of the triguna ? And not
entirely for my own satisfaction..

If indeed there are 'lokika' levels of the triguna, we have two mentioned in
the scriptures : the statement that they are created in prakrti implies
their action at universal level; while the Gita refers to them at the
personal level, Arjuna as a (representative) individual, subject to choice
involving good judgment, passion, or ignorant inertia.

The suggestion that there are three levels of guna action -- universal,
local, and personal -- seems to be borne out at universal level in that
between day and night, dawn and dusk are especially propitious for worship
through their balanced, peaceful nature 'on the cusp'. And the seasons of
the year seem to have their guna balance/imbalance -- which one may call it.

Is there a hint too, that Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva represent guna aspects of
life ?

But the one 'daivika' (?) aspect that is missing, it's always seemed to me,
is that 'measured termination' to all things that are born or arise, which
is so plainly present in the universe, as in human life -- and perhaps to be
seen in those 'localiities' such as Mojendaru, which are favoured by the
elements for a time and then disappear..

I hope I'm not pushing you on this; and there's no need to reply unless a
reply comes (do I need to say that to you ?!)

Pranams,
Michael

The description of the three gunas are exhaustively discussed in the 14th
chapter of Gita.

In the 17th Chapter, Krishna describes their expressions in terms of speach,
action and even food wise. There is also discussion of daiviisampatti and
aasurii sampatti.

Hope this helps.

Hari Om!
Sadananda

I'd like to raise the question of tamoguna.

Like most people, I guess, I at first accepted the standard dictionat
definition that sattwa is the quality of goodness and knowledge; rajas, the
energy of action; and tamas, inertia and darkness.

Then later I was introduced to the idea (and I'm asking for any source texts
here) that there were two aspects to each guna : divine and demonic. So that
'demonic sattwa', kashaya, is illusory goodness and knowledge (as anyone
who has been to California will rcognise..); 'demonic rajas', vikshepa, is
destructive agitation; and 'divine tamas' has something of Shiva : the
divine measure of things which gives shape to all actions; and mal is the
demonic 'inertia and darkness'' normally agttributed to tamas, without
distinction.

This seems to me to be an insult to tamas, if its divine aspect is not
acknowledged..

I hope for comments and source texts on this matter.

Michael
