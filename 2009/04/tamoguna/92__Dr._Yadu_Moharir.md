Namaste Bhadraiah:

The word asura is defined as "asuhu ye ramante iti asuraH"

Meaning - Ones who are and/or prefer t keep enjoying living (within indriiyas).

asura's as depicted in pauraaNika stories & comic books (black with blood shot eyes and thick lips with protrudingk-9) often contribute to the confusion of this term.

Regards,

Dr. Yadu

Dear Michael, 



Very good question. Devas and asura/rakshas were all children of prajapati, meaning their origin same, but something in their nature differentiates them. The question of daivi and asuri aspects of a guna is linked to the definition of asura/rakshas. I always used to wonder why there are two types of bad guys and what is the difference between them.
