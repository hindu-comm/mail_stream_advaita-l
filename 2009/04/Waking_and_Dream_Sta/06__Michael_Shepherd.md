Yes indeed -- in my moments of saatsaakkaara I don't need to bother others
with such questions ! ;)

I think we are in agreement; except in that I understand that chidaabhaasa
arises only from the contact with objects of the senses. My point was that
in the state of being in dream, there are not such external objects,
therefore chidabhaasa as such does not arise..though other aabhaasa may
already exist.. i.e. one does not learn about reality from the dream
itself.. only perhaps from the content of the dream and the fact that it has
occurred.

You are right that chidabhaasa arises as thought (of objects) arise in the
mind - that we call specific reflecting thoughts.

What we call sakshii caitanya is also a reflection by the general background
pool of the mind - it is also called upahita chaitanya -or conditioned
consciousness - it is that because of which I have the knowledge of the
experience of even deep sleep state where the vishyaa or object thoughts are
not there. During realization it can also be referred to as akhandaakaara
vRitti, which Ramana calls as 'I am' 'I am' wihout any qualifications since
qualifications belongs to vishayaas.

Hari Om!
