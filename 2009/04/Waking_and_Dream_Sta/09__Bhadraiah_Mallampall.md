Dear Sadanandaji,



I wanted to check scriptural references only. 



Whatever happens between guru & shishya is their matter. We have record of 

various instances when two shishyas meet with each other they would never know whose

guru was right. It is for the gurus to figure out. 



Personal experience can be settled individually at our convenience. 



Best regards

Bhadraiah
