Dear Michael



>it's the Abrahamic religions or 'faiths' that need to >reconsider the meaning of 'faith'.. then perhaps the >world would talk with one voice..



May be that is what they meant. Why should they change meanings to make themselves compatible to other systems? Where is the need to copy features? Can a goat paint itself into a tiger? 



It is not as simple as if one bank introduces ATM every other bank wants to introduce ATM. If the core philosophy doesn't change what is the use of chaning peripheral explanations? Can an individual become supreme being in Abrahamic religions? Do they authorize you to negotiate or redefine the purpose of their religions?



Regards

Bhadraiah
