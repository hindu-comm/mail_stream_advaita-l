I live in the North-East United States with my wife and 2 children. I'm
originally from South India. I'm deeply interested in knowing and
understanding our religion and traditions better. My wife and I are
constantly seeking better insight into various aspects of our religion and
we look forward to learning and contributing on this forum. Our particular
areas of interest are Vedanta, our customs and rituals and scriptures.
