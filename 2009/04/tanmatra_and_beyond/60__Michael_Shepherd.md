I have seen it said that while shabda is the tanmatra of akasha, shabda is
created by/from hearing -- and likewise for the other elements: a form of
'creation by necessity' if one can put it that way. It suggests a slight
difference of viewpoint.. .

Is there any scriptural authority for this view ?
