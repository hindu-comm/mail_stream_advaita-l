namo namaH

Thanks everyone for the interest shown in this talk. We have received several questions and requests regarding this talk. Here is a short FAQ:

1. Will there be a teleconference facility available? Will I be able to get the full text of the talk? Will the audio be available?

A: Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide teleconference facilities. However, the entire speech will be recorded and made available later on speaksanskrit. org

2. Will the talk be in Sanskrit or English ?

A: The talk will be mostly in Sanskrit interspersed with English. However, knowledge of Sanskrit is NOT a pre-requisite for attending the talk. Absolute strangers to Sanskrit should be able to understand the talk.

3. I am not in the DC area. Are there any events organized nearby ?

A: Shri Krishna Shastry will be speaking on several campuses on the east coast as part of this lecture series. For further details, please visit:
