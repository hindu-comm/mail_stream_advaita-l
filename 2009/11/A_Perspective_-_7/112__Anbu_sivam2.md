Michael,

I have laboured as much not to use Sanskrit jargons or quotations for all
laymen to understand.  "i" is ever-present and so is a qualified witness.
As to his nature, literally, he is ignorant.  He however has a lakshya or
object to attain says the Veda.  That can only happen when he loses his
ignorance namely the "i"ness.
