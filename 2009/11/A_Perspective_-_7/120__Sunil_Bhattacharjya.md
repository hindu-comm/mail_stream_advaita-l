Dear Anbuji,

I am asking too many questions. I hope you will not mind. I perfectly agree with you statement regarding the Dvaita and Advaita, when you said as follows:

//// Dwaithis hold that the Jeeva and Easwara will remain separate for ever. In Visishtaadvaitha, these two though separate, can blend in harmoniously. Though there are thaaraathmya or heirarchy among Gods the jeeva can seek to get promoted to those ranks by dint of sat karma. ////

Does this not show that the Dvaitins and Visishtadvaitins have a trace of ego in not giving up the separateness from the Brahman? It may mean that they do not intend to leave the last Kosha (the Anandamaya kosha). Any comment?

Regards,

Sunil

"Now let us discuss some problems or pratibandhakas that inhibit the correct
understanding of the mahaavaakya. Mind always has a tendency to project or
objectify any knowledge, since it works in the field of tripuTi alone. tat
vijijnaasaswa – one has to inquire into the nature of reality, says the
Upanishad. The inquiry can only be done with the mind. That is, I, with the
mind is the enquirer, since mind by itself cannot do any inquiry without the
support of a conscious entity. Hence, I say I am conscious of the inquiry
too. That is what pramaata means involving the tripuTi-s. Hence even in the
self-inquiry, the mind habitually has a tendency to project or objectify
what that ‘I am’ is, while the scripture is trying to guide the inquiry by
saying that you are not this – na iti– na iti – not this – not this. Mind
is used to objectify and the scripture says it is the subject that is
involved in all objectifications. In the very habitual objectification, I
miss the subject, the conscious entity, or to state exactly I do not pay
attention to the subject. This is the major problem for many spiritual
seekers."

Yes indeed the inquiry can only be done with the mind, specifically by its
intellect!

The idea that 'I am this body that is different from other bodies'
constitutes the awareness of "i" as opposed to the non-i where both "i" and
non-i are known as bodies. In this idea the "i" is the witness of both.
There is definitely a discord between the "i" and the non-i. This is
jeevathwam (pasu). In the idea 'I am all the bodies' the awareness does
exist of all bodies but they are all identified with "i". Here too the "i"
is the witness of both of bodies and the sense of "i" that is not specific
to any one single body. However the discord is absent. This is
Easwarathwam (pathi). It is likened to the many parts of human body
functioning in concord.

Dwaithis hold that the Jeeva and Easwara will remain separate for ever. In
Visishtaadvaitha, these two though separate, can blend in harmoniously.
Though there are thaaraathmya or heirarchy among Gods the jeeva can seek to
get promoted to those ranks by dint of sat karma.

The idea of witness has to be gleaned from the above.

*However, for advaitins a witness, whatever is his nature, is part of the
guNa-karma or the 'big mind' that I talked about before. Such witness is
entangled. The Self-realization takes place only when this karma is totally
denied of its existence through self-inquiry.** In this inquiry a person
travels from 'karmaNye vaa adhikaarasthE..' to 'na karmaNa na prajaya na
dhanaa thyaagEnaikE amrithathvamaanasuhu'.
