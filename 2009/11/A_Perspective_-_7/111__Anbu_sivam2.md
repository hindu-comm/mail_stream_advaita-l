Dear Vishyji,


Quote: "I feel the small mind and i (ahankara ) is one and same. Small mind
is nothing but "i" thought that is ever present."

You have not explained why you feel the 'small mind' and "i" are one and the
same.  I have assigned different roles for these two entities.  'small mind'
represents the known (world) and the "i" represents the knower.

The world appears and disappears and that is easily discerned when the
'small mind' is absent.  But the knower does not appear and disappear and
you do readily admit to his ever presence.

Quote: "Just that peace ,which is experienced without small mind and
intellect, is recorded in chitta, which is recalled (as I slept well) by 'i'
when becomes active again in the morning."

Here you are contradicting yourself.  If the 'small mind' and "i" are one
and the same then they both should be absent during deep sleep.  However you
are referring to an 'experience of peace' that was recorded by chitta the
memory.  So I ask you: who is the experiencer?  where does he come from if
"i" is absent?
