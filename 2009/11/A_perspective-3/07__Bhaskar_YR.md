sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for your kind advice & instruction. As always, you are so kind to 
mend my ways prabhuji.  But here I regret to bring to your kind notice 
that whenever any issue comes like this, I am always at the receiving end 
& those others who openly attacks me personally get away without even a 
word of caution!!  I am not able to understand why this partiality in an 
open forum like this!!??  You are my one of the guruji-s and you know very 
well whatever little knowledge I've today is the grace of your goodself & 
you have every right to fire me & I'd like to take it as 'upadesha'.  But 
at the same time, IMHO, being one of the moderators of this esteemed list, 
I expect your goodself to throw a word of caution or two to others also 
atleast whenever there is a clear indication of personal attacks. If you 
dont do that, then those who have the liberty to openly call others as 
'mad' would think that they are doing 'fine job' in passing the personal 
remarks.  Hope, atleast in future, you would intervene in those instances 
& nip these type of developments in the bud. 

I thought, whenever I am talking to you directly, I should be true to 
myself & donot want to keep anything behind the screen.  Hence this direct 
request to you prabhuji.  Kindly pardon me if I said anything wrong here.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
