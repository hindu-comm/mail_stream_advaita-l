My question is it dharmically acceptable to listen and learn from it 
(especily cd's by vedic scholars/purohits e.g. Radhakrishna Shastrigal) ?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

IMO, it is not at all advisable to learn veda maNtra-s through electronic 
media...Personal interaction/attention of the veda guru  is very much 
necessary for the student of veda.  Oflate, there is a trend in South 
India that some people will perform varamahaalaxmi, gauri, varasiddhi 
vinAyaka vrata etc. by following the recorded maNtra-s & pooja vidhAna  in 
CDs...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
