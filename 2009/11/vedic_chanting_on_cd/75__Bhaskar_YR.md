I believe the BHANA Lingam stones found in the banks of Narmada river 
have a very unique crystalline needle like structure of  symmetric 
composition.
When a person chant RUDRAM with proper method , these crystals going 
into a kind of perpetual vibration, which I believe they were able to 
scientifically record.
However, if one was to record the same with the best possible form of 
digital equipment and replay, there is absolutely no vibrations 
exhibited in the crystal of any sort.
This proves one of the fact, the JIVA or Prana factor while chanting 
the VEDAS plays the most critical part.
