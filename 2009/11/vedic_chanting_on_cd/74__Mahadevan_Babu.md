Dear Sri Ravi,
Sri Gurubyo Namaha !
I tend to agree with Ramesh in that one need to worry only about his  
or her own qualifications and righteous deeds.  If in doubt, it is  
always best to refer to your parents first and then to your family  
purohit or other learned Scholars.

As far as chanting in CDs are concerned, I would not learn from them  
initially for sure, but may use it for practicing along etc.
Also, when you learn it front of a Proper Vedic Pandit, he will  
correct your tones, pronunciations etc.

But, there is a big difference from a Human being chanting and the  
same being played from a CD / Tape etc.

The following is is a scientific finding I heard from one of a learned  
scholar / practitioner /scientist in USA.

I believe the BHANA Lingam stones found in the banks of Narmada river  
have a very unique crystalline needle like structure of  symmetric  
composition.
When a person chant RUDRAM with proper method , these crystals going  
into a kind of perpetual vibration, which I believe they were able to  
scientifically record.
However, if one was to record the same with the best possible form of  
digital equipment and replay, there is absolutely no vibrations  
exhibited in the crystal of any sort.
This proves one of the fact, the JIVA or Prana factor while chanting  
the VEDAS plays the most critical part.


Also, after many years of chanting continuously before the Bhana  
Lingam, the crystals go into a perpetual form of vibrations and they  
emit the same vibrations back.

Hari Om
Babu
