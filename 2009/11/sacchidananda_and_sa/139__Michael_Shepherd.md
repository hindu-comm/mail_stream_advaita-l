I apologise in advance if this is a well-worn theme ; but it is one which is
beyond the normal scope of grammar-books :

Does internal sandhi tell of more than the 'joining' of words in the mind ?
Does it imply a sublation, or transcendence, of the individual terms, rather
as a sentence may become a unit in itself ?

I'm thinking of such an example as sacchidananda : is it reminding us that
rather than what we define for ourselves as truth or knowledge,
consciousness, and bliss, and endeavour to imagine as a 'state', that ananda
can only be known as the truth and consciousness of bliss -- i.e. not
'bliss' as some experience in itself ?

And correspondingly, truth can only be known in the consciousneess of bliss,
and consciousness in the bliss of truth, etc..

I hope this makes some sense as a question; and once again, apologies if
this is a well-worn discussion. Though I'd still like to be informed of the
(blissfully conscious) truth of it !
