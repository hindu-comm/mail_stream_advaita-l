In your puja is saaroopyam ( becoming one with God ), in chanting your name
Shiva ! Mahadeva ! is saameepyam ( being close to God) and Saalokyam (
living with God )is in being in conversation and being among your devotees
who hold you on their head and Saayujyam (mingling with God ) is in
meditating always on your movable and immovable form of Universe and I get
all these in this birth itself. Oh1 Bhavanipathi ! Oh! God I have got what
is worthy.

*Commentary*

Aum

"Karthur aagnyayaa praapyathE phalam" says Bhagavan Ramana. "LabhathE cha
thatha: mayaiva vihithaan hithaan" says Geetha. For every karma that a
person does or for every upaasana on many different anya dEvathaa he
performs, the phala always comes from Parameswara. From this it is clear
that He alone is capable of giving Moksha Saamraajyam and none else.
Therefore, "SivaprasaadhEna vinaa na mukthi:" one cannot get Mokshasukham in
all of hundreds of millions of births without sivaprasaadam. Moreover among
the four purushaarthaas of dharmam, artham, kaamam and Moksham, Moksham
alone is the most superior one. When a person enjoys his aathmaswaroopam as
non-different from Paramasiva, with the akhandaakaara vritthi gnana as
'SivOham' such a state of existence is called Saayujya Moksham. Below this
are the three padhavis called Saaroopyam, Saameepyam and SaalOkyam.

"DehO devaalayaprOkthO jeevO dEva: sanaathana: |
thyajE thagnaana nirmaalyam sOham bhaavEna poojayEth ||

Hey! Parameswara! When a person wears vibhoothi and rudhraaksham and dons
the guise of Shiva with the smaranNa of 'SivOham" and goes about doing his
lakshaarchana with bilvadhaLam and prostrates his many saashtaanga
namaskaarams to you, you grant that person Saaroopya Moksha padhavi.

Hey! SambO! When a person sings in great extacy, his songs of praise such as
"Siva, Siva MahaadEva SambO Kaasi Viswanaatha GangE! Hara Hara MahadEva
Sambo Kaasi Viswanaatha GangE!" you grant him a place close to you so he can
get into a permanant state of ecstasy at your sight and such a bhaagyam is
the Saameepya Moksham.

Hey! PrabhO! To all those Sivabhakthaas who gather and share among
themselves thier sivaanubhavam and delight themselves in it you give them
SaalOkya MOksham by taking them to Kailaash.

SivO chaathaa sivO bhOkthaa sivassarvamidham jagath|
SivassarvaaNi bhoothaani sivaadhanyath na kincha na ||

Hey! Siva! To those who meditate on you as the entire jagath, there is
nothing but you to them. Hey! BhavaanipathE! You indeed give them the
highest Saayujya MOksham!

Bhavani Shankarji ki Jai!
