Sadanandaji - Pranaams

You said //// In dream state, not that intellect is not there - it is at lower grade
than emotional mind - even in dream I do differentiate x vs y in my
transactions. That discriminative faculty is intellect only. //// 

Thank you for your opinion and I agree with what you said.

In fact the sareeras can be divided into three types and these are the Sthula sareera, Sukshma sareera and the Karana sareera. The latter two are also expressed together as Sukshma sareera. I understand that the Karana sareera goes to the next birth.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya

Sunil

Sunilji - PraNAms

Manas and buddhi are part of
 subtle elements. They are not separate - one is the discriminative faculty and other is the emotional faculty. Anupravesha statement of the upanishad is accounted by Shankara as entering subtle body to bhoutica shariira. The whole sublte body travels from one loka to the other leaving only the gross body. vijnaana kosha is superior to the manomaya kosha - Tai Up. Shankara says - the consciousness shines more in the intellect first - budhyaaveva bhaaseta swaccheshu pratibinbavat - Atma bodha. 

In dream state, not that intellect is not there - it is at lower grade than emotional mind - even in dream I do differentiate x vs y in my transactions. That discriminative faculty is intellect only. 
Even in the waking state, the intellect is not in full potential - that is what veveka emphasized as one of the requirment for realization - That intellect to differentiate the nitya and anitya has to be develped by study and saadhana. 

I am not
 familiar with sankhya and miimamsa texts to give any reference - sorry.

Hope this helps

Hari Om!
Sada
