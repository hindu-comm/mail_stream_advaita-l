Dear Sunil,

If you are successful in fiinding a copy of the proceedings on the date of Adi Shankara, which I certainly hope you are -- I'm sure we'd all be grateful if you could give us a brief resum√© of that..

And of course, the date of Gaudapada is related to that of Adi Shankara -- some scholars would consider that a matter of almost equal importance re his karika and Advaita Vedanta !

Regards,

Michael

Dear friends,

To my knowledge there was a conference on the date of Adi Sankaracharya in Mumbai, which was organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Itihas Sankalan Yojana (ABISY) in association with some other organizations in October, 2002. If any member attended that conference and / or got the proceedings would he kindly let us know how to get a copy of the proceedings and also who should be contacted for that. I did contact the ABISY but that did not help.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
