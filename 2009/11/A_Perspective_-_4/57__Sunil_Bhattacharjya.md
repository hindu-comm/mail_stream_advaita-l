Dear Anbuji,

You
seem to be widening the topic under discussion. We were talking about
Nashkaama karma and you brought in the terms, "Pashu" and "Pashupati".
I would not call it irrelevant though.

"Paashabaddha it Pashu".
Kamyakarma creates the pashas, the fetters. When one stops doing
kamyakarma completely and all the karmas are Niskaama karma then only
one can become free form the paashas and be one with the pashupati.
Doing both the Kaamyakarma and Nishlkaama karma together is like
visha-mishrit amrita, ie. the nectar mixed with poison and we are not
discussing about that now. That type of mixed work does not qualify to
be called Niskaama karma any more.

Nishkaama
karmi is the real Sannyashi and a Yogi and not the one who became
Sannyashi by initiation into Sannyasha. You seem to have forgotten what
Lord Krishna says : "Sri Bhagavaan uvaaca - Anaashritah karma-phalam karyam karma karoti yah sa sannyaasi cha yogee cha na niragnir na chaakriyah".
I consider Lord Krishna as the Supreme authority, the guru of the
gurus. Now do not tell me you consider Lord Shiva as the supreme
authority or someone else. I have nothing more to say after this
pronouncement by Lord Krishna. To me there is no difference between
Lord Krishna and Lord Shiva. I do not discount the authority of
Sadanadaji, whom you quoted but I am sure he too must be accepting the
authority of Lord Krishna.
