Sadanandaji,

Namaste,

Do you think a man would do niskaama karma without pure mind and without a longing for moksha, whether directly or indirectly. I am talking of doing niskaama karma day in and day out. and not what one might do once in a way.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya

Sunilji - PraNAms

Yes If Krishna finds that the yogi has a pure mind and is longing for moksha, then either he will make sure that the yogi will get proper teacher or he himslef will comedown and teach.

When the student is ready for knowlede and want to have that knowledge, he wlll find the appropriate teacher- that is the law.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
