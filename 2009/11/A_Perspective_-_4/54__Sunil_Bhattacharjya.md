Anbuji,

It happened exactly as I feared. I said "This is to say in short. A guru may elaborate this in an hour-long or a day-long lecture." I should have elaborated what I said. A small attempt follows:

Look at this way. A jnani, the jivanmukta, who sees through the veil of Maya, who sees "Sarvam khalvidam Brahma" too has to work while living in this world like Lord Krishna too performed work. What do you think the attitude to the work thay have or had ? I was referring to that attitude. A true Niskaama karmi has and must have that attitude. I call this type of person only as the Niskaama karmi. Are you calling all the work done by everybody all the time as niskaama karma? When a person has the right attitude towards doing Niskaama karma his behaviour pattern changes entirely even though it might some take time for fachieving that.  A whole lot of things change with Samadristi. When Lord Buddha was accused by a woman of molesting her he smiled and felt pity for her. Can you smile when people accuse you falsely? If you give some examples of the niskaama karma, which according to you are being done by everybody all the time, we can analyse them
 here and now. Nice to know from you that everybody in the world had overcome his or her personal desires.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya

Quote: "When do we do Niskaama karma?"

We all do it all the time! Though unconsciously. We do it because of
love!!

'Aathmanasthu kaamaaya sarvam priyam bhavathi' says the Veda. This
AATHMAKAAMAM is so very natural!

So tell me do people really do nishkaama karmam on the basis of samadrishti?

Karma is maaya. Gnaanis are beyond it. This is Vedantham.

Aagamists keep karma and maayai separate and apart.
