Sunilji - PraNAms

Yes If Krishna finds that the yogi has a pure mind and is longing for moksha, then either he will make sure that the yogi will get proper teacher or he himslef will comedown and teach.

When the student is ready for knowlede and want to have that knowledge, he wlll find the appropriate teacher- that is the law.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
