I find your statement very agreeable. Perhaps you could copy it under the
title you suggest -- as I am still pursuing the question I originally posed
here. Since then the discussion has ranged far and wide, deep and high !

I like the way you desribe it too. The thought that awareness/consciousness
(Brahman) is everything is what the Shruti states. And that is what we
contemplate on in the process of unfolding the truth for ourselves as part
of our sadhana.

This is however the eternal paradox and I believe most beginners like me get
stuck.

Here is my understanding:

The shruti states that liberation is a state of knowledge complete in itself
and non-dual (sat-chit-ananda; Aham-Brahma-Asmi). This cannot be a thought
in itself but rather a cessation of it (not by will but by complete
absorption in oneself). It therefore cannot be "attained" by Karma or any
action for that matter. Also, this statement of the shruti cannot be proved
or disproved inellectually and the shruti itself must be taken as the
pramana. This is where the shraddha aspect is so imporant and is the basis
for progress.

Unfortunately however, when we start the process, we are in ignorance
(otherwise there would be no process) and the process to the removal of
ignorance is the sravanam, mananam and nidhidhyasanam. This process in
itself must be backed up by upasana of some kind that leads to purification
of the mind without which the whole vedantic process becomes an intellectual
exercise (further strengthning the ego) . It is tempting to think that by
jumping to Vedanta, we can short-circuit the process of upasana/karma yoga
(which is not very far from what Arjuna thought when he learnt that there is
an "option" called gyana yoga which could be an option to the uncofortable
truth of fighting a bloody battle).

This is where, I believe Upasana, Karma Yoga and Vedantic study must ALL
occur for progress to happen. It is a tight feedback loop where progress in
one area leads to progress in others. The process of Upasana and Karmayoga
together help us attain the sampattis that lead to weakening the hold of the
ego. The weakened ego allows for better understanding of the shruti,
increases sradhha and this feeds back into itself. Once a person has
attained Jeevan Mukti he however continues to play the game of upasana and
karma for the others in the world to see until Videha mukti. This is what
our great acharyals have done for all of us to see and emulate for thousands
of years and maintained the paramparaa.

Hence the question of "What happens after liberation" or "What next" or "So
what" ia a moot question which I have often seen in purely intellectual
discussions on moksha, nirvana etc. The question itself implies an incorrect
understanding of of moksha.

I would like to solicit arguments for or against this so I can refine my own
understanding. If I get some comments, I would then like to change the
Subject of the discussion to "The process of unfoldment of truth".

Hari Om.
