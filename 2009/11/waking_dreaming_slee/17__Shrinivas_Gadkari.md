Namaste,

Revisiting this thread after several days:
In our daily experience we are awake, we sleep and we 
see dreams. Now we have three states of consciousness 
"awake state", "dream state" and "sleep state". 

Based on my understanding and experience it will be too 
hasty a conclusion to equate: 
"awake state" = what we commonly mean by "awake experience",
"dream state" = what we commonly mean by "dream experience",
"sleep state" = what we commonly mean by "sleep experience".

It is true that "dream state" dominates the "dream experience",
and "sleep state" dominates the "deep sleep experience",
However, the "awake experience" (based on my understanding)
is quite complex. Though the "awake state" is easily
recognized in "awake experience", there are interspersed
experiences of "dream state" and "sleep state" in
the "awake experience". Recognizing/ examining this
phenomenon, in my opinion, forms the foundation for
study/ exploration/ understanding of the three states
of consciousness. hari om.

Regards,
Shrinivas
