Namaste Shri Sunil,

I think you are on right track here. Every person who is successful in
a vyAvahArika sense, has some degree of siddhi of the vidyA that is
described in mANDukya upanishad. It is a different matter that most
people may not know that the source of their skills lies in their innate 
ability to use this vidyA of mADUkya upanishad in their daily lives.
(very likely these people studied this vidyA in their previous lives).

It is said that the only vidyA one needs to learn is the vidyA described
in mANDukya upanishad. (I think this is a statement made by shrI rAma 
to shrI hanumAna.)

Regards,
Shrinivas

Dear Michael,
Can we say that during the night-dreaming the subconscious mind can act 
on a problem and that can give some indication of things going to happen in 
the future but in day-dreaming the sub-conscious mind would not act that freely.
I understand that with training one can however train the sub-conscious mind 
to analyse problems even in the waking sate. Some executives light a cigarette 
and keep quiet fort a short while and leave the problem to the sub-conscious 
mind to analyse and by the time cigarette is half smoked the answers are ready. 
Some people believe like that. I too subscribe to that thinking to some extent 
though I do not smoke. Any comment?

Regards,
Sunil

Subject: waking, dreaming, sleeping, as mutually supportive

Namaste,

Revisiting this thread after several days:
In our daily experience we are awake, we sleep and we 
see dreams. Now we have three states of consciousness 
"awake state", "dream state" and "sleep state". 

Based on my understanding and experience it will be too 
hasty a conclusion to equate: 
"awake state" = what we commonly mean by "awake experience",
"dream state" = what we commonly mean by "dream experience",
"sleep state" = what we commonly mean by "sleep experience".

It is true that "dream state" dominates the "dream experience",
and "sleep state" dominates the "deep sleep experience",
However, the "awake experience" (based on my understanding)
is quite complex. Though the "awake state" is easily
recognized in "awake experience", there are interspersed
experiences of "dream state" and "sleep state" in
the "awake experience". Recognizing/ examining this
phenomenon, in my opinion, forms the foundation for
study/ exploration/ understanding of the three states
of consciousness. hari om.

Regards,
Shrinivas
