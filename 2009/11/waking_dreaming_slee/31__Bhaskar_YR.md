By incorporating the wisdom of states of consciousness and their
interrelationship may make us more capable beings. There however
is no guarantee that just this knowledge itself will guide people on 
the "correct" path.

I think if we do avasthA traya viveka (three states of consciousness & its 
detailed analysis)  with the help of guru & shruti vAkya it would lead us 
to the 'correct' path.  Because shruti mAta herself taken all the trouble 
to explain these prakriya in detail at vaious places.  Before commenting 
on mAndukya shruti, (the shruti, which is exclusively dedicated to this 
avasthAtraya viveka) shankara says this prakriya is vedAntArtha sAra 
saMgraha bhutaM idam prakaraNa chatushtayaM.  And elsewhere shankara says, 
sushupti viveka (i.e. knowledge of deep sleep state) is itself enough to 
get viveka about vishesha rahita Atman.  Ofcourse, in naishkarmya siddhi 
sureshwara says when avasthAtraya viveka is done on inferential ground it 
does not fetch us Atma jnAna...But here what I am emphasizing is 
AvasthAtraya viveka with the aid of shAstra vAkya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
