Vijayaji --
One of the most helpful reminders I have been given, is that our relationship to all others -- including our closest 'relations' -- is always through the Lord.
That, I've found, dignifies all relationships, to friend and stranger alike, and lifts the veil of maya as the lightest gossamer silk...
Michael
