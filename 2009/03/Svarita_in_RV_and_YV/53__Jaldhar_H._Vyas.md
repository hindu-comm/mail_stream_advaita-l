(btw for some reason this message was considered by the listserver as 
spam.  I had to manually approve hence the delay.  Sorry.)

The tones under discussion are specific to Vedic recitation and 
unconnected to any of the Hindustani or Karnataka musical traditions of 
today.  (Though they themselves consider their origin to be Vedic and some 
scholars have tried to trace the ancestry with meagre results IMO.)
