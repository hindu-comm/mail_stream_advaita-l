I cannot answer for anyone else  but rest assured that I did not feel 
disturbed by your questions.  It is a legitimate question to ask.  I just 
wanted you to be sure you knew the traditional answer.

Unlike Bhadraiah I do not think the English language or "western thinking" 
etc. are impenetrable barriers to understanding these things.  It is the 
Internet itself, which is a constricted medium of expression compared to 
face-to-face interaction, which is a bigger problem.  We would probably 
still have misunderstandings even if this list were conducted entirely in 
Sanskrit.

I think you are doing the right thing by studying face-to-face with 
Pandits in India.  I recommend this to all readers.  This list should be 
used as a supplement to such study, primarily for factual information, not 
as a replacement for it.
