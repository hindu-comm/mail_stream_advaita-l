To answer your questions, the Vedas feature a stress-based accent system 
that barely remains in classical sanskrit.  Some of the Vedic metres 
survive in classical sanskrit but mainly newer ones are in use.  While 
there are some books on the correct method of recitation of Vedic texts, 
they are solely an aid to memory.  Accurate memorization from a guru who 
has learned and memorized in the same way is the only legitimate method of 
learning recitation.

However:

You should not bother chanting the Vedic texts anyway as you are not a 
Brahmana. The goal of Advaita Vedanta is to know the Self (atma). 
Knowledge of the Self (jnana) is not a thing that can be acquired by any 
method.  It is already present in all sentient beings but is hidden by 
ignorance and delusion.  The discipline of Dharma is a negative method. It 
destroys the obstacles that prevent jnana from shining forth.  It is the 
Dharma of Brahmanas to learn and protect the Vedas and many of us here 
belong to that caste so we do discuss such topics from time to time but 
for other Hindus and for foreigners it is not desirable or even necessary 
to copy us. As I said before, all sentient beings are capable of jnana so 
there is some method for anyone.  But it is not the same method for 
everyone.
