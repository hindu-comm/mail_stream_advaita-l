Vidyasankar,
thank you very much for your answer. On the possible difference between musical tones and vedic recitation tones I didnŽt take care till now. Does this means we couldnŽt lay down texts like the Chandogya upanishad, the only upanishad I have studied till now, to music and vedic recitation? If so is there any text,who deals with the way how a vedic texts has to be chanted? What is the correct way to chant vedic texts  after the view of learned men? What is about the metric of the texts? Is the metric dealt in early sanskrit texts different from the metric of the vedic texts. What says the learned men on this subject?

With best regards
Andreas
