It is option 2. I am not for consoling myself that we are adhering to
pratishakhya rules exactly, by twisting plain sUtra texts. For one, it
makes no sense to do this, and the second thing is it would completely
invalidate the namudiri recitation which is quite different from the
other recitation. Surely two quite different recitation modes cannot
be faithful to the prAtishAkhya. Things can change and it is allowed.

I am not sure where you are going with this and the below. Is it your
contention that because someone taught padapATha for this verse from
the Rg veda everyone else should change to Rg veda svaras? My
contention is that there is nothing to disprove that these verses
could not have existed on any of the yajur-shAkhas which have
disappeared. As a matter of fact the mantra-prashnam contains many
verses which are not found in the yajur veda whith yajur svarams. So
are all these to be changed because padapAtha for them exist in the
R^ig veda? In fact kumArila uses this exact same argument about
gR^ihya karma mantras.
