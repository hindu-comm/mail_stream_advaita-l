Dear Sir,
thank you to all who felt the need to answer my question about the way how
to chant vedic texts and their mertic.
MY question was from the very beginning only academic. I have neither the
wish to chant vedic texts nor do I want to change my status.Also if the
changing of status would be possible after some scripts, what would be the
advantage of doing so? Before I will ask you this question I have to study
the textes named by you. I also have not the wish to start an own group in
Germany.
If some of you felt disturbed from westeners questions while practice, why
do you feel the need to answer me? I didn?t want to disturb anybody.
I be aware of the problems the English languages brings in the discussion in
every Sanskrit text. If you want to ban this problems you should avoid
English and do all discussions only in Sanskrit.
The only way for a foreigner to learn the basic in Sanscrit and Tamil is the
Indology institute. Only after this it is possible to take classes from
learned pandits in India, from whom I got now the possibility to read any
text in Sanskrit and Tamil.If you will change your discussions in these
languages to avoid the English language, you can be sure I will be able to
follow your discussion.
Once again, I never wanted to disturb anyone. Please excuse the question if
you are so much worried about it.All I want is to understand the texts, To
read and to understand them is different.For to understand the texts I need
the help of learned men.This was my reason to enter your group as I told in
my application.I live far away from India and have no learned men next to me
to ask them.

Andreas

To answer your questions, the Vedas feature a stress-based accent system
that barely remains in classical sanskrit.  Some of the Vedic metres
survive in classical sanskrit but mainly newer ones are in use.  While
there are some books on the correct method of recitation of Vedic texts,
they are solely an aid to memory.  Accurate memorization from a guru who
has learned and memorized in the same way is the only legitimate method of
learning recitation.

However:

You should not bother chanting the Vedic texts anyway as you are not a
Brahmana. The goal of Advaita Vedanta is to know the Self (atma).
Knowledge of the Self (jnana) is not a thing that can be acquired by any
method.  It is already present in all sentient beings but is hidden by
ignorance and delusion.  The discipline of Dharma is a negative method. It
destroys the obstacles that prevent jnana from shining forth.  It is the
Dharma of Brahmanas to learn and protect the Vedas and many of us here
belong to that caste so we do discuss such topics from time to time but
for other Hindus and for foreigners it is not desirable or even necessary
to copy us. As I said before, all sentient beings are capable of jnana so
there is some method for anyone.  But it is not the same method for
everyone.
