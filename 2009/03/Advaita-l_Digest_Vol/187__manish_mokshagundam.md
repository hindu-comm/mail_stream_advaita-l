dear Maheshji

i give a different perspective of time-space / space-time unity. off course
the differences between every conceivable vyavaharika satya ends on
realisation of the truth; Brahman

what i would like to point out is that we routinely use the concept of
"space-time unity" every day in the sankalpa. the sankalpa methodology of
reciting desha-kala before starting some thing is used by all, even
dwaities, etc

if one were to apply this knowledge, it is evident that at least the duality
or separateness of space and time does not exist in vedanta darshana, never
mind the various schools of thought

regards

Dr. Manish Mokshagundam
