Rama,

His mentioning this was in the context of only three individuals whom we were talking about. He never mentioned that the Holenarsipuram Swamigal did not know Mimasa or Nyaya. Hence your statement is"ativyapti" i think.

Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.

He said that the panchapadika & other explanations are from people who are
versed well in other shastras as well; and unless one knows Nyaya & Mimasma
well one cannot appreciate their views. He said that Panchapadika is saying
what the bhasya is saying and is not opposed to it.

So, essentially he is saying that people who oppose pancapAdikA are
not well versed in nyAya and mImA.msA. That was exactly the conclusion
of my paper - it's good to have some confirmation of my views from
learned scholars.

Rama
