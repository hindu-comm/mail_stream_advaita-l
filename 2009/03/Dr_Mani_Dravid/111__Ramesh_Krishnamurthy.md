As a teaching method there is no issue at all but adhyaropa-apavAda is
also an exegetical tool of sorts as it enables the bheda vAkya-s in
the shruti to be subordinated to the abheda vAkya-s. Several
pUrvapakSha-s seem to argue that adhyAropa-apavAda enables some kind
of selective interpretation of the shruti.

Alternatively, one could perhaps say that it actually provides for
common ground (albeit in hierarchical fashion) and is hence in tune
with Anarthakya.
