How does it matter if the person criticizing pa~ncapAdikA is the
Holenarsipur Swamiji or anyone else?

The statement has to do with criticisms of pa~ncapAdikA, which
according to Sri Dravid implies the knowledge (or the lack thereof) of
the person making the criticism. It is not affected by *who* is making
the criticism.
Frankly, it's amusing to see the Holenarsipur people hurl base insults
at everyone from Vidyaranya down to Mahasannidhanam, and take umbrage
at anyone who even dares to question Holenarsipur dogmas. So much for
open minds and scholarly criticisms.
