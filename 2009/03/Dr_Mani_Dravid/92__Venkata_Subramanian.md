I met Dr. Mani Dravid in person yesterday at Chennai. I find him a person ofa good quality learning and humble in attitude.... his maternal grandfather is the famous Rajarajeshwari Sastry Dravid of Varanasi.......!

I of course asked him - whether Mulavidya tradition is really Bhashya virudha - or it is not so; 

He told me - the tradition of Panchapadika is not incorrect; and in fact even the Holenarsipur tradition is also in fact not incorrect totally. They are prakriyas within the Bhashya and there is no problem in the Advaita tatva. He said that the panchapadika & other explanations are from people who are versed well in other shastras as well; and unless one knows Nyaya & Mimasma well one cannot appreciate their views. He said that Panchapadika is saying what the bhasya is saying and is not opposed to it. 

Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
