The first part that the Panchapadika tradition is not incorrect: implying that the Panchapadika tradition is correct.

The second part that the Holenarsipur tradiation is not incorrect *totally*: implying that the Holenarsipur tradition is incorrect *partially*.

In other words, those parts of the Holenarsipur tradition that contradict the Panchapadika are to be cast aside as incorrect, the rest may be accepted.

It is obvious from the above that Dr. Mani Dravid is siding with the Panchapadika and that its doctrine takes precedence over the "newly begun" viewpoint.
