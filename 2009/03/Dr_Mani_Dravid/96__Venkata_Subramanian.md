You are right, he said the exact word. He told it is incorrect to say everyone down Sureshwaracharya is wrong.

But he never said what the Holenarsipur Swamigal said is incorrect, in fact he positively praised the Swamiji for his works and said he is within the tradition. 

Hence i conclude for myself - there are rather 3 sub-schools - Bhamathi, the Vivarana and the Holenarsipur.

why it matters who said it - am not sure whether the Swamiji was unaware of Mimasa & Tarka; nor did Dr. Dravid say anything on that. He only mentioned that the persons whom he interacted with - did not have an answer; that is a limitation of that person not the Swamiji or his prakriya. Hence the issue.

Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

How does it matter if the person criticizing pa~ncapAdikA is the
Holenarsipur Swamiji or anyone else?

The statement has to do with criticisms of pa~ncapAdikA, which
according to Sri Dravid implies the knowledge (or the lack thereof) of
the person making the criticism. It is not affected by *who* is making
the criticism.
Frankly, it's amusing to see the Holenarsipur people hurl base insults
at everyone from Vidyaranya down to Mahasannidhanam, and take umbrage
at anyone who even dares to question Holenarsipur dogmas. So much for
open minds and scholarly criticisms.
