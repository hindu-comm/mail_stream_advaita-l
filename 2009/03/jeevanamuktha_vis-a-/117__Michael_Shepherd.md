Manishji,

I guess you'll know which, when it happens ! :)
 It'll feel either like a liberation, or a shaking-off of the world (both of
which sound a little dualistic, since we're said to feel, when it happens,
that it's been like that all the time..)

However -- do you think that an avadhoota sounds more likely to stay
solitary, the jivamuuktha to mix in the world ?

Mikroth

Subject: [Advaita-l] jeevanamuktha vis-a-vis avadhoota



i find it hard to see the difference between the two. going by the
definition that a avadhoota is a person who has absorbed all knowledge and
has no need for even the vedas. how is he any different from a
jeevanamuktha, who too has acquired all the knowledge there is

regards
