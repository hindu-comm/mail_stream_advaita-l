I would define avadhuta as being more of a term of practice.  Whereas 
jivanmukta describes more of an mental or existential state.

Avadhuta refers to those sannyasis who maintain an extreme counter-social 
attitude. (I won't say anti-social because the aim is not to be hostile to 
social norms just seperate from them.)  They are particularly connected 
with Bhagavan Dattatreya but there are Tantric and Vaishnava saints who 
use the term avadhuta as well as Advaitins.

A Jivanmukta is a sannyasi who has realized Brahman in this lifetime.  As 
far as I know, the term is used only in Advaita Vedanta not in any other 
sampradaya or darshana.  A particular jivanmukta may be an avadhuta or he 
may not.
