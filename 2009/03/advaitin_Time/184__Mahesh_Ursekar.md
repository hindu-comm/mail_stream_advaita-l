Pranams!

First off, I wish to apologize for starting this thread on two groups. I
seem to have read somewhere that this is not good practice. I merely posted
to this group since I did not receive any reply to my posting on Yahoo. So,
to make amends, I will only reply to postings on this group since this group
seems more active on the topic.

So, my posting on yahoo is reproduced below again (I only read Sri
Sadananda's posting there and this was a direct reply to the same):

"Pranams!

I would like reply to your points in some detail but prefer to hold on for a
while till I get more clarity on this issue by expounding the reason for my
question:

While I understand that time belongs to the vyAvarhAric satta, I was
wondering if the Sruti, or Sankara make any specific mention about the
*nature* of time. It seemed odd to me that of the trio space-time-causality
that define our world, space & causality find considerable mention, but I
have not come across a single place that Time has been mentioned
specifically.

Even if vyAvahAra is to be transcended in the final calling, Time forms a
very important component of it, especially in meditation & on
self-realization. So, leaving it unspoken of seems a bit odd.

So, in short, my question is "is there any discussion of the nature of time
by any of the Advaitic philosophers"? Or is its nature is to be inferred
from what is said otherwise. Or maybe, at the end of the day, it is not part
of philosophy but physics.

Thanks & Pranams, Mahesh

PS> A rather smart person who I asked this question said, AkAsa really means
space-time (since space & time are intricately entwined ala Einsten! :-)).
