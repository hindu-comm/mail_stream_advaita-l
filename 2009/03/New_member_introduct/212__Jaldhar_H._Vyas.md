Hello there,

Namaskar. I am Bishwa Prakash Subedi from Nepal.

Vedanta as propounded by our great forefathers/mothers in the past is my 
area of interest. I am in particular interested in Poojya Shankara's 
advaita-vedanta-related teachings and His literature. Satsanga with the 
learned and devoted friends and seniors of the list in this line will help 
me in my endeavour to enlighten me.

My regards to you all,

BPSubedi
