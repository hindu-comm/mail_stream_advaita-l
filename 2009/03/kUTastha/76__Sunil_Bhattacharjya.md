Dear Jaldhar Vyasji,

Namaste,

Yes, being or remaining in the peak (of the mountain) may be the more appropriate meaning than being on a heap (of trash). Kuta means "Apex".

In Mahabharata we have the Kuta slokas which confuse even the scholars and these Kuta slokas are definitely very intelligently composed verses. For example Vedavyasa said that at the time of the Mahabharata war that Saturn was staying in Visakha for one year. This was an astronomical datum. Then Vedavyasa also said that Saturn was giving trouble to Rohini and this is an astrological datum. It is very unfortunate that all astronomers, without exception, discarded the real astronomical datum and accepted the astrological datum to be the astronomical datum, as they could not interpret Vedavyasa's composition. For their stiudies in dating of the Mahabharata war they took the graha Saturn to be in Rohini in place of Visakha. 

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Some interesting responses about the meaning of kUTastha.  While I acknowledge
the Vedantic meaning and I can't really quibble with the English translation
as kUTa can indeed have these various meanings in Sanskrit, from a purely poetic
point of view I still prefer "standing on a mountain"  Standing on a
heap is not so evocative and who the heck stands on an anvil? :-)
