Some interesting responses about the meaning of kUTastha.  While I 
acknowledge the Vedantic meaning and I can't really quibble with the 
English translation as kUTa can indeed have these various meanings in 
Sanskrit, from a purely poetic point of view I still prefer "standing on a 
mountain"  Standing on a heap is not so evocative and who the heck stands 
on an anvil? :-)
