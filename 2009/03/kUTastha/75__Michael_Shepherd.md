Jaldharji,

Sanskrit often yields unexpected glimpses of truth through its dhatu; and In
Advaita Vedanta, personal experience is significant... There are many
tributes to the effect of standing on a mountain; and seers and prophets
often take inspiration there; but have you yourself tried standing on an
anvil ? ;)

Michael

Some interesting responses about the meaning of kUTastha.  While I
acknowledge the Vedantic meaning and I can't really quibble with the
English translation as kUTa can indeed have these various meanings in
Sanskrit, from a purely poetic point of view I still prefer "standing on a
mountain"  Standing on a heap is not so evocative and who the heck stands
on an anvil? :-)
