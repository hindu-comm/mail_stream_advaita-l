Vaidehiji,

I think we agree about time : physical time ceases to exist at the subtle
level, when it becomes a sequence of events or thoughts, in the eternal
present, punctuated by being.. a very restful view !

Michael

hari om

advaita is very clear about the concept of time: it is defined as the
gap between two thoughts (vruttis). see bhagavan ramana maharshi's
works, he is very clear about these aspects.

also in mADUKYA UPANISHAD, THE KARIKA IN VAITATHYA PRAKARANA REFERS TO
TIME AS CHITTA KAALA (PSYCHOLOGICAL TIME) AND DVAYA KAALA (PHYSICAL
TIME). Sri Gouda pada clearly refers to these two types of notions of
time while negating the waking and dream states as nothing but
illusion. indeed, there is no difference between these two states at
all.
