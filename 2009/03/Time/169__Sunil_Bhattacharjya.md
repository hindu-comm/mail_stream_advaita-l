Shri Maheshji,

Advaita does not rule out the existence of the material world. It does not ignore the time-scale given in the fifth veda ie. the puranas. An advaitin sees the unity in all. Everything is Brahman. Time is an essential concept in the Vyavaharic sense but in the Paramarthic sense the concept of time does not exist. As time began with creation time, the concept of time has no meaning for a Videhamukta Brahmajnni. 

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Sri Maheshji,

While the pundits are assembling their answers... I enjoy the Jaina view :
it's there to remind us of the eternal present !

Pranams!

Can anyone tell me how 'Time' is conceived of in Advaita Vedanta? There is
talk of space (AkAsh) as one of the pacha-mAhAbhutas but no mention of Time
anywhere that I know of.

Thanks & Pranams, Mahesh
