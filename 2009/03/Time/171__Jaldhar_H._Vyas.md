In the case of issues like time, I think Advaitins accepted the samkhya - 
vaisheshika etc. definitions simply because they didn't really care. 
Thats why we accept the modern scientific definitions just as easily. 
It's not really any of our business.

But darshans such as purva mimamsa or yoga which deal more with issues on 
Vedantas "turf" so to speak do sometimes get defered to in the manner you 
suggest.
