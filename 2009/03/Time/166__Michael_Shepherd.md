Sri Maheshji,

While the pundits are assembling their answers... I enjoy the Jaina view :
it's there to remind us of the eternal present !

Michael

Pranams!

Can anyone tell me how 'Time' is conceived of in Advaita Vedanta? There is
talk of space (AkAsh) as one of the pacha-mAhAbhutas but no mention of Time
anywhere that I know of.

Thanks & Pranams, Mahesh
