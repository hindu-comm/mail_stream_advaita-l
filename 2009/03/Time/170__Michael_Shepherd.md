Maheshji, Sunilji, and others,

This question of time offers me the opportunity to raise a question on
behalf of Western and non-Hindu readers alike :

Advaita Vedanta makes it clear that kaala -- which seems to cover the sense
of time, allotted period, fate. and life itself -- is inherent in the
relationship between Brahman and Maya, and thus phenomenal.

But other darshana have their own viewpoints, which are of interest : not
least, Sankya's 'atomic time-clock' definition that it can only be measured
as 'the duration taken by an atom to traverse its own unit of space.' !
Some regard it as beginningless; immaterial; to be distinguished as absolute
and relative; inert; devoid of the guna; to be seen simply as past, present,
and future; subject to destruction; a tattva; and a constrictor to the
individual jiva..as a kosha (kalakosha ?)

I think we can recognise most of these definitions from experience.

So it raises the question for non-Hindus : do the individual darshana --
such as, in this case, Advaita Vedanta -- say more, or less, about a
specific topic because of 'keeping half an eye' on the definitions of the
other darshana; as Adi Shankara sometimes does verbally or by implication ?

I hope this makes sense..

Michael

Shri Maheshji,

Advaita does not rule out the existence of the material world. It does not
ignore the time-scale given in the fifth veda ie. the puranas. An advaitin
sees the unity in all. Everything is Brahman. Time is an essential concept
in the Vyavaharic sense but in the Paramarthic sense the concept of time
does not exist. As time began with creation time, the concept of time has no
meaning for a Videhamukta Brahmajnni.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Sri Maheshji,

While the pundits are assembling their answers... I enjoy the Jaina view :
it's there to remind us of the eternal present !

Pranams!

Can anyone tell me how 'Time' is conceived of in Advaita Vedanta? There is
talk of space (AkAsh) as one of the pacha-mAhAbhutas but no mention of Time
anywhere that I know of.

Thanks & Pranams, Mahesh
