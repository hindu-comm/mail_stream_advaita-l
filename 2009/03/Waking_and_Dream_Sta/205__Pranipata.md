Hari Om Shri Sadanandaji,  Pranaams!

Simply put, this is anavasthA doSha.  Positing a mind internal to a mind and 
a mind internal to it...  To avoid this only AcAryaji declares the reference 
point for internality of dream objects is indriyAs (indriya apekShayA 
antasthaH).

>>And I confess to the urge to explain the world in terms of my waking dream 
>>!

Hari Om Shri Michaelji, Pranaams!

Yes. That is also explained by AcAryaji.  yathA jAgare svapiti; tathA eva 
svapne. (as is dreamt in waking state, so also in the dream)

akShi gataH rUpaM drShTvA nimIlita-akShaH tad eva smaran manasi antaH 
svapnaH eva tad eva vAsanArUpa-abhivyaktaM pashyati.  (The object which he 
saw with eye-lids open, the same he recollects closing his eyes like dream; 
this is(seeing with closed eye) what is seeing manifestation of vAsanas 
without objects. ) (MUKBhashya 1.1)

While equating the two states it is not only done one way I.e. yathA svapne 
tathA jAgare; also by other way yathA jAgare tathA svapne. This is called 
asamvyApti-parihAraH.
