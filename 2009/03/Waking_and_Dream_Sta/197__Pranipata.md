Hari Om Shri Sadanandaji,  Pranaams!

Since mAndUkya is quoted, the bAShyA details bahiShprajnaH and antaHprajnaH 
as:

bahiShprajnaH:  svAtmavyatirikte viShaye prajnA yasya saH bahiShprajnaH. 
Viewing with other upaniShadic statements like parAk pashyati na antarAtman, 
Atma should refer to Self and not BMI, I feel.

antaHprajnaH: indriya-apekShayA antaH sthstvAt antaHprajnaH.

The reference point for externality in waking state is Self(pratyagAtman); 
for internality in dream state is indriyAs.

In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya

Subject: [Advaita-l] Waking and Dream States - II

 From the point of the waking state, BMI (body, mind and intellect) it is 
called bahiprajnaH as the waking world is external to the waker’s mind; and 
the dream state is ‘antaH prajnaH’ internal to the waker’s mind. The 
reference point here is quite clear
