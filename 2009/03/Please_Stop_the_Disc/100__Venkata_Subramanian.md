Well,

I did not take any formal "permission" from the Sastrigal. 

Since he is an authority as accepted by many, i wanted to share what he said with the forum. 



Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

namaste Sri Venkat,

Did you take explicit permission from Sri Mani Dravid Satrigal that you are
going to discuss his view on a public forum with "open to all" public
archives?  This not a published paper or a book, which we can comment upon and
discuss. This was a private conversation between you and Sri Sastrigal. Since
Sri Sastrigal is not a member of the list and does not have an opportunity to
clarify his position, it is better to drop this discussion, especially with the
subject as Sri Sastrigal.

I received a complaint about it. If you have received such a permission from
the Sri Sastrigal, kindly clarify. I hope members understand that this and not
post further in this thread.

Thank you.

With best wishes,
Ravi

incorrect; and in fact even the Holenarsipur tradition is also in fact not
incorrect totally.  They are prakriyas within the Bhashya and there is no
problem in the Advaita tatva.  He said that the panchapadika & other
explanations are from people who are versed well in other shastras as well; and
unless one knows Nyaya & Mimasma well one cannot appreciate their views.  He
said that Panchapadika is saying what the bhasya is saying and is not opposed to
it.   Thanks & Regards,
