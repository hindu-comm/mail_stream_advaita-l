Pranaams Anbusivamji,


Thank you very much Anbusivamji for a very thought provoking reply that the answer given is also maya. Desire and ambition lead people to hope more from the world of maya. It is difficult to see how to transcend this world of maya to find that which is Satchitananda. I will continue my efforts.

Yours in the lord.
Vijaya.

How would you accept if the answer given is also Maya?

Could you please tell me whether the affection we feel for our mother

father friends siblings and others is only maya and a creation of our

vasanas or whether it has a reality that transcends maya. Do we ever

meet these individuals again after death and become one with them.



Also, is the atman apart and separate from the world of gross objects

or does it include these objects and further transcend them. Is there

anything that the science of physics, chemistry ,maths etc can teach us

about brahman. I personally find meditation difficult. How can I live

in world of body mind and intellect and still attain peace.



Could this group shed light on these matters which must be simple for

those on this list.

Vijaya.
