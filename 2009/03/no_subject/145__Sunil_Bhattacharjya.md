Dear Bhadraiahji,

I think the Dvaitists worship Lord Vishnu and not Lord hiva.They are against Adi Sankaracharya as he explained the scriptures to show that the Bhakta is no different from the Brahman, when the former realises the latter. This according to the Dvaitas is the destruction of Bhakta and that is why they called Adi Sankaracharya a demon, who took birth to destroy the world.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

I may be wrong about this. Aham Brahmasmi is undoubtedly the Jiva/Brahman model. 



Puranas prohibiting direct worship of Brahmaji may be a warning not to ignore Shivji and Vishnu bhagvan, for the moral implications involved. Most rakshasas worshipped Brahmaji directly. (Dvaitists' accusations about Adi Sankara be based on similar reasoning.)



To conclude discussion re: Pratika, it may be said that just as Knowledge is Brahman or Bliss is Brahman, pratIka (pre-eminence) is also Brahman. pratIka is ever present. We see worldly objects like ghata and pata only due to misapplication of pratIka. The antahkaraNa (inner doer) is pure Brahman. For the ordinary person, at the slightest exposure to the past karmas etc, pratIka shows those objects related those karmas in quick reaction instead of showing the true nature of antahkaraNa.



Regards

Bhadraiah
