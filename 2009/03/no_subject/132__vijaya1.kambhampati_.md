Could you please tell me whether the affection we feel for our mother 
father friends siblings and others is only maya and a creation of our 
vasanas or whether it has a reality that transcends maya. Do we ever 
meet these individuals again after death and become one with them. 

Also, is the atman apart and separate from the world of gross objects 
or does it include these objects and further transcend them. Is there 
anything that the science of physics, chemistry ,maths etc can teach us 
about brahman. I personally find meditation difficult. How can I live 
in world of body mind and intellect and still attain peace.

Could this group shed light on these matters which must be simple for 
those on this list.
Vijaya.
