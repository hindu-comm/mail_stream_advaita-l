namaste Sri Venkat,

Did you take explicit permission from Sri Mani Dravid Satrigal that you 
are going to discuss his view on a public forum with "open to all" 
public archives?  This not a published paper or a book, which we can 
comment upon and discuss. This was a private conversation between you 
and Sri Sastrigal. Since Sri Sastrigal is not a member of the list and 
does not have an opportunity to clarify his position, it is better to 
drop this discussion, especially with the subject as Sri Sastrigal.

I received a complaint about it. If you have received such a permission 
from the Sri Sastrigal, kindly clarify. I hope members understand that 
this and not post further in this thread.

Thank you.

With best wishes,
Ravi

They are prakriyas within the Bhashya and there is no problem in the Advaita tatva.  He said that the panchapadika & other explanations are from people who are versed well in other shastras as well; and unless one knows Nyaya & Mimasma well one cannot appreciate their views.  He said that Panchapadika is saying what the bhasya is saying and is not opposed to it.
