I for my part, apologize and will stop on this thread. If anyone is to
blame for complaints - it's likely me, I personally think there was
nothing objectionable about Venkats emails or what he wrote. I should
admit this topic makes me go off the rails a bit - and that very
likely offended someone :-).
