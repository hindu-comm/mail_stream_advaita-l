Namaste -

".....In the spareness and
austerity of things around, we seemed smaller materially than anything we
could think of and yet the power of the consciousness of the spirit was
enhanced by the darshan."
"....Physicists have always wondered if there is a direct interaction between two
conscious human beings without the aid of the sense organs. I believe I have
some verification of its possibility."

Very beautiful, thanks for sharing....

Savithri
