Dear Friends,

I request if any of you can please help me find  a piece of Adi  
Shankara's works (like a stotram,  or a piece from a bhashyam) or any  
granthavali that he has done for Surya Bhagawan.

We are planning to celebrate this year Sri Adi Shankara's Jayanthi  
with a theme as " ShaNmatasThApanAcharya " here in Sydney.

I have the complete Adi Shankara's Granthavali, but not able to find  
one regarding Surya Bhagawan.

I would much appreciate your directions in the above.

Thanking You

M.Babu
