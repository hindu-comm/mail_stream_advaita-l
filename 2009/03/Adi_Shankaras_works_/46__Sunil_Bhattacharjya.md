Dear Mahadevanji,

I am presently staying near Sydney. Can you kindly give me the details of the Adi Sankara Jayanti program ?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Friends,

I request if any of you can please help me find  a piece of Adi Shankara's
works (like a stotram,  or a piece from a bhashyam) or any granthavali that he
has done for Surya Bhagawan.

We are planning to celebrate this year Sri Adi Shankara's Jayanthi with a
theme as " ShaNmatasThApanAcharya " here in Sydney.

I have the complete Adi Shankara's Granthavali, but not able to find one
regarding Surya Bhagawan.

I would much appreciate your directions in the above.

Thanking You

M.Babu
