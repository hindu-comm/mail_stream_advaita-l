>From the context in upanishat ("He eats food with prateeka (without limit, meaning limits are only 

set by available resources of the system or limits of adhi-daivas who are higher than the formula)"), 

it appears to me that prateeka means releasing a formula for open use after it is well proven. 

Generally any meditation technique or sadhana kriya is put to extensive testing and practice 
before it is released for general use. Releasing it for general use means every though in the mind 

can use it freely (from that point onwards) and the formula gets institutionalized. 

This could be dangerous if it is not a well tested formula. 



For concentrating on a single formula or deity or model we have several other words like tapas.

Bhadraiah
