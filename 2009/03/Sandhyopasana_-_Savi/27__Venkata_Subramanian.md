> Vidyashankar,  You have rightly referred to the explanation of Sringeri
Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekara Bharati. I have a doubt here.  When I do
Sandhyavandana, should I necessarily consider that the Aditya in my front (Stula
Aditya in the Akasha) as the prateeka for the Savita, (Savita = Brahman as I
understand), or do I have the option to close my eyes and consider directly
Savita - directly as per the meaning of the mantra, in which case my focus is
not necessarily on the Stula Adityain my front up in the sky......!  Thanks,
Venkat

When you are giving the arghya you are necessarily considering the actual sun. 
However, aleast the way I learnt it, after that you are supposed to say
'asAvadityo brahma'  It is this vakya that identifies the sun with
Brahman.
