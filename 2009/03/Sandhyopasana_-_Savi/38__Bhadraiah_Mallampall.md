(Sorry for another mail. This part was in the earlier mail but it didn't post, possibly due to some invisible character). 



>From the context in upanishat ("He eats food with prateeka (without limit, 
meaning limits are only set by available resources of the system or limits of 
adhi-daivas who are higher than the formula)"), it appears to me that prateeka 
means releasing a formula for open use after it is well proven. Generally any 
meditation technique or sadhana kriya is put to extensive testing and practice 
before it is released for general use. Releasing it for general use means every 
though in the mind can use it freely (from that point onwards) and the formula 
gets institutionalized. This could be dangerous if it is not a well tested formula. 

For concentrating on a single formula or deity or model we have several other words like tapas. 

Regards
Bhadraiah
