Dear All,
      Advaita is a state of mind, not just a philosophy. If the mind is not
ready to concentrate on
the Para-Brahman, there is nothing wrong in keeping a diety. All medicines
do not work on all patients. You have to tune to that philisophy where your
mind is closer to. It does not make sense
on meditating on the Parabrhaman when your mind cannot perform to its best.
It is better to keep
a diety and in this case the Sun Lord.
The Sun is the source of everything that keeps us sustained on this earth.It
is the source of all energies [ except nuclear] , Source of rain, source of
gravitation to earth, the light of the moon. Infact it is the closest
representation of Advaita too - One energy manifested into many.

It is your comfort level. Not what is the best.
regards
Chetan
