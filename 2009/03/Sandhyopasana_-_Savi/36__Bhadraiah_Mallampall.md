Shri Vidyasankar,



I agree that every one's focus could be different, ranging from sthula aditya to Brahman. 



I am interested in the etymology of prateeka. This word is found either Br.U or Ch.U. "He eats food with prateeka". 



prati means against, opposite 



prati-ma is image

what is prati-ka? What is the effect of adding a deergha as in pratee-ka?



>From the context in upanishat ("He eats food with prateeka (without limit, 

meaning limits are only set by available resources of the system or limits of 

adhi-daivas who are higher than the formula)"), it appears to me that prateeka 

means releasing a formula for open use after it is well proven. Generally any 

meditation technique or sadhana kriya is put to extensive testing and practice 

before it is released for general use. Releasing it for general use means every 

though in the mind can use it freely (from that point onwards) and the formula 

gets institutionalized. This could be dangerous if it is not a well tested formula. 



For concentrating on a single formula or deity or model we have several other words like tapas. 



Regards

Bhadraiah
