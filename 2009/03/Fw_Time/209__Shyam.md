Let alone Brahman, the Unmanifest is Itselfbeyond Time as the very first mantra of the Mandukya talks about. Time -like space - is very much a product.

Hari OM

Pranams Sri Krishnamoorthy:

Time = Brahman? But isn't Brahman outside space & Time? Further, as per my
understanding, when Krishna says He is Time, He saying this as Iswara? (I
may be opening a can of worms there is no consensus as to whether Krishna is
Brahman or Iswara here).

Thanks & Pranams, Mahesh
