7. When one deva thinks he/she is subordinate of another deva (e.g. speech subordinated to manas etc) you get conditional Brahmans. This subordination is entirely unnecessary for speech in absolute terms, but happens due to ignorance. 



==> In this case the ignorance mentioned above is that of speech itself, not that of jiva or ahamkara, just to avoid blaming the wrong party. These are systemic issues, rather than individual lacuna of jiva. (Other examples of conditional brahmans may be various hierarchical levels of samadhis). 



12. The indirect method (through devas) which does not follow the two stage dvaita path is the re-enactment method 



==> Extreme care is needed in selecting the right kind of re-enactment that is based on advaita. The word re-enactment is used worldwide for various purposes. People may re-enact Krishna's acts on Krishnastami, or other 'religions' have other ways of re-enactments elsewhere in the world.   



(All this effort is only to analyze the role played by devas in advaita. Often advaitists say, Adi Sankara "also" worshipped his favorite deva/devis in addition to practice of advaita; Advaita "also" support Shrutis etc. These are merely redundant statements besides the point. There are direct statements of Shruti well discussed and accepted by Sankara, that deal with devas and still maintain supremacy of advaita.)
