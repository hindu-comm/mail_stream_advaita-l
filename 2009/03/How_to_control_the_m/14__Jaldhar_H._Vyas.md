If one truly believes that the world-appearence is mithya then one should 
immediately renounce it.  You have put yourself in an untenable position 
by being immersed in samsara yet trying to deny it. As you have found out 
it is very difficult to maintain such an attitude.

The Vedic path is two-fold, pravrtti or desireless works and nivrtti or 
renunciation.  Although Advaita Vedanta considers nivrtti to be superior 
it does not condemn pravrtti precisely for people like you (and me.)  By 
restraining the ego through strict attention to duty without expectation 
of reward, the mind gradually becomes steady and still over time and will 
naturally tend towards renunciation.  Meditation is a part of this not an 
end to itself.

Again it is unhelpful to talk about abandoning illusions.  Instead think 
of them as purNa -- unlimited.  So in terms of deities the Advaitin does 
not see them as false but as pervading all include ones own Self.
