Dear Bhadraiahji, 

Self control or "Yama" is the first step towards the "Mind control" in the Yoga route.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Suresh, 



Why do you try to view everything as illusion during waking state? I think that
is the first problem. Rejecting waking state as illusion means rejecting valid
evidence, which is wrong. With a wrong start you will never achieve a good end
result. 



Why should we control mind? After all mind is a resource, so we should use it
better. Controlling is good only if the person excersizing the control is
perfect. Otherwise there is no control at all. 



Self control is better than mind control. There is an inner balance in every
person called samana. We should try to gear up with that balance; that will show
us the way.



Regards

Bhadraiah
