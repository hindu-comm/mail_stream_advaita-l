Dear Pranipataji,

Namaste,

We are talking about mind-control. May I also add what the Kena Upanishad says :

"What is not thought by the mind but by which the mind is said to think, you (should) know that truly is Brahman and not what is worshipped here" (KU 1.6).

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Hari Om Shri Bharadwajji,  Pranaams!

pratibodha-viditaM matam . (Kena II.4)

na anyad dvAram antarAtmanaH vijnAnAya. ataH pratyaya-pratyagAtmatayA viditaM
brahma yadA, tadA tat mataM tat samyag-darshanam iti arthaH.

There is no other door to Its awareness. Therefore when Brahman is known as the
innermost Self (i.e. witness) of cognitions, then is It matam, known, that is to
say, then there is Its complete realization. (shankara-bhAshya and translation
by Sw. GambhIrAnandaji).


In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
