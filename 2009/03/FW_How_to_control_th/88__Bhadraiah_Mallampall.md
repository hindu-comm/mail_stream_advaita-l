This question can also be answered using Adi Sankara's logic for Br.U.I.4.15. 

When a jiva wakes up into this world, the accumulated karmas bring the jiva back into the world. As the jiva has not yet resolved these karmas and does not know the nature of these karmas, the world jiva wakes up into can not be his own world, as it is created out of ignorance. As per Sankara, a world created out of ignorance can not be ones own. Just as one goes into some one's house does not use the objects like food without permission, likewise this world has to be rejected. When the jiva does the required followup and traces the ultimate cause of the waking world to prajna (deep sleep state) only then the world becomes one's own. 

Regards
Bhadraiah
