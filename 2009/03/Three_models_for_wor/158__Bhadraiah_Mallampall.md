Shrinivasji,



Thanks BG.15, I will check it out. (Some one please show me the search button for the list.) 

The list of models is infinite, and I did not list them in any order. In fact, depending on how 

you want to classify, Atma vs Maya model can be put on top, and Atma/devas/Maya/Jivas be next. 

Br.U.I.4.10 serves as Shruti for Atma/Maya model, and Atma/Maya model is higher model because 

it eliminates the layer of devas. 



I have a feeling Brahma Sutras & Bhashya draws its terminology from the entire vedic literature, 

so it may be tough to understand. It is like Tai. pr a large portion of which makes sense only to 

someone who has chanted all four vedas or some one who has depth in vyakaranaM. 

Sutras are concentrated knowledge. I suggest beginners may work on Upanishat Bhashyas, 

learning a bit of pranayama here and there hinted in there. That should give a good handle 

on the subject, after which one can branch out to one's area of competence. For people like 

me who did not even learn Rama shabdam reading originals is a Himalayan task. 



Regards

Bhadraiah
