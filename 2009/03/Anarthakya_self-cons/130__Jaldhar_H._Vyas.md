They are two seperate people.  I know sometimes it isn't clear when I put 
multiple introductions in one email.

It's my fault.  I didn't stop to think that Chinmaya was a pseudonym when 
I subscribed him to the list.

To the anonymous webmaster, we prefer members do not use nicknames in this 
list.  Can you go to your list options page and change to your real name? 
Email listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org if you need help in doing this.
