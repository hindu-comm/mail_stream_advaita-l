While that's correct, my observation had to do with the legal system
built on religious texts, so it's more of a historical observation
(pre-democracy)  than anything else. At least Edgerton agrees/implies
that the old Western legal system was not based on the principles of
Anarthakya, while the Indian jurisprudence did follow the principle.
This is not to say one was better than the other, or anything like
that, only how these things were derived.
