Dear Vaidehiji,

"Samyak jnana" was used only to mean "proper understnding of the concept". I think a detailed thesis on the word "Samyak" is not necessary.

Secondly "see through Maya" was used to mean to know what is Maya and that is possible only when one develops the Sattva guna.

In the maze of arguments and quotations one should not mess the concept. One who has understood the concept of Maya properly is a Brahmajnani and he will not need to read the scriptures even.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

hari om sunil bhattacharyaji

a small clarification here i wish to give. there is nothing called
samyak knowledge of maya. in fact maya is avidya (see yogavasista
original). there is no samyak knowledge of avidya for it means self
contradiction.

In yogavasista, sri vashihsta says to rama in utpatti prakarana
chapter, sloka 1.20

avidyA samsrutrbanDo mAyA mOhO mahattamaH
kalpitaaniiti naamaani yasyaaH sakalavedibhiH.

of which (of the world which is illusory in nature) several names have
been coined by the learned: avidya (ignorance), samsruti
(transmigration), bandhaH (bondage), mAyAillusion), mohaH (delusion),
mahat (great), tamaH (darkness).

creation is maya. there is nothing to see through maya. Infact, to
stop seeing maya is advaita.

may be it is necessary to stop here for intellectual discussions
should necessarilyaim at stop the ripples of thoughts arising.

thanking you

vaidehi
