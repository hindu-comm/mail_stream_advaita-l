PranAms.
I would like toadd a small notehere.

There is no question that any love felt for ones children is not for their sake but for ones own sake -even a parents loveis not strictly selfless in that sense - as the Br. Up famously declares - na vaare putraanaam kaamaaya putraah priya bhavanti atmanastu kamaaya putraah priyaa bhavanti It is not for the sake of the sons my dear that the sons are loved but for ones own sake that they are loved.....

The goal for a seeker is always to get rid of the notional dehatmabuddhi - any attachment one feels towards any relation, however exalted - is only a sign that our dehatmabuddhi is extremely strong....after all any relation of mother/father/etc is only in relation to the sthoola shareera - our grosses manifestation - no mother ever gives birth to the sukshma shareera...like two logs of wood in a rivermeeting only to be swept away in diferent directions after a brief journey allour relations are ephemereal - let us not allow ourselves to be diverted by their concern.

We always need to make the subtle but important distinction between love and attachment. Love for anyone - motherfatherchildren spouse etc can very much be there - for love is freedom - an outpouring offulfilment in itself, an expression of the boundless fullness which is our own intrinsic nature. I daresay we do not know what this love is!

But attachment - ah we know very well - it is what we confuse for love- and attachment is bondage. Our desire to hold on, wedded to relationships we hold dear, believing them to be, or wishing them to bepermanent - unable to bear even the thought that their impermanence is a certainty. 

Dwelling on the fact that each one of our relationships is timebound and will end in time - whether in a matter of days or weeks or years - will help us not only maintain a sense of perspective that allows to focus on the task of hand which is to transcend thisprapanca of form/function/result but also in a transactionalrealmmay help us better appreciate the limited time that we have these individualsin our lives as a blessing of Ishwara.

Ifattachment we must have, let that be to our Divine Mother, let usever recognize that alone as ourOne true relationship,let usnever cease to intensely long for communion with Her.

Humble pranams

Dear Vaidehiji,

"Samyak jnana" was used only to mean "proper understnding of the concept". I think a detailed thesis on the word "Samyak" is not necessary.

Secondly "see through Maya" was used to mean to know what is Maya and that is possible only when one develops the Sattva guna.

In the maze of arguments and quotations one should not mess the concept. One who has understood the concept of Maya properly is a Brahmajnani and he will not need to read the scriptures even.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

hari om sunil bhattacharyaji

a small clarification here i wish to give. there is nothing called
samyak knowledge of maya. in fact maya is avidya (see yogavasista
original). there is no samyak knowledge of avidya for it means self
contradiction.

In yogavasista, sri vashihsta says to rama in utpatti prakarana
chapter, sloka 1.20

avidyA samsrutrbanDo mAyA mOhO mahattamaH
kalpitaaniiti naamaani yasyaaH sakalavedibhiH.

of which (of the world which is illusory in nature) several names have
been coined by the learned: avidya (ignorance), samsruti
(transmigration), bandhaH (bondage), mAyAillusion), mohaH (delusion),
mahat (great), tamaH (darkness).

creation is maya. there is nothing to see through maya. Infact, to
stop seeing maya is advaita.

may be it is necessary to stop here for intellectual discussions
should necessarilyaim at stop the ripples of thoughts arising.

thanking you

vaidehi
