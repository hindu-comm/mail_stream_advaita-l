If we desire it than yes.  But like all desires it is a fetter that binds 
us to samsara and must be transcended for mukti.  The way to do it is not 
necessarily to stop loving but to extend the love so that all living 
things are thought of as ones family.

If you think about it isn't a mothers' selfless love our first 
introduction to advaita bhava?
