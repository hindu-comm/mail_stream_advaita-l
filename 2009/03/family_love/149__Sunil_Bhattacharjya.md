I think Jaldharji and Vaidehiji are talking about the same thing. Yes, mother's selfless love for the child is the first step towards Advaita. One learns the first step of selfless love from that. When all other creations are treated like-wise, ie. like one's very own, then it becomes universal love. At that stage one gets rid of the the separateness or otherness and becomes Samadarshana and can see through Maya, ie. realise that there are no real differences between the various creations. As long as this samyak knowledge of Maya is not achieved what persists is Avidya and there is Vasana.

hari om

it is in the way we look at things. love and affection for parents,
siblings and even spouse - is it or is it not vasana or maya. Infact,
call by any name - vasana or maya they both mean the same. mandukya
upanishad calls it spandana (vibration). the bhavana behind is what
makes a difference to the affection or love you show to others. remove
the otherness from the love or affection, it is pure, self existent
and self effulgent. this is the effort we the seekers should attempt
in our every day transcational world.
