Hari Om Shri Vyasji,  Pranaams!

kUTasthaH

a. kUTaH iva sthaH - kUTaH rAshiH . rAshiH iva sthaH. kUTaH means a heap. 
kUTasthaH is that which exists like a heap.
b. kUTa-rUpena sthaH - kUTA mAyA, vancanA, jihmatA, kuTilatA iti paryAyAH. 
aneka-mAyA-vancanAti-prakAreNa sthitaH. kUTa is mAyA, deception, falsehood, 
crookedness, which are synonyous. That which exists in the diverse forms of 
mAyA etc. is kUTasthaH. (BG 15.16 bAshya)

This term refers to Atman as silent witness(sAkShI).

When the sAkShitA of Atman is also realised as upalakShaNa and not tAttvikI, 
the brahmAtma-aikya becomes complete. (Advaita Makaranda v.20)


In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
