I found this interesting article about the birthplace of Shankaracharya at 
Kaladi (Kerala) on another list and thought Advaita-l readers might be

The rest of Shri Sarvanan Iyers blog is well worth a look at.  It has many 
wonderful articles about various tirths and mandirs the author has 
visited all acommpanied by photos.
