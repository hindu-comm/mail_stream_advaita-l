Gentlemen,

I pass on a question from a philosophy student : what (transliterated) in
Tamil is Ramanaji's celebrated 'Who this 'I'?;

and what sound do Tamil devotees seek the source of, as we in English do
with 'I' ?

As you will appreciate this is a question about shabda and languages --
which may or not be relevant..

The student suggests that in seeking the source of this 'I-sound', the mind
will later hear the 'unspoken' sound of 'aham'... but this is theory as
yet..

Michael
