Reply to Sri Bannanje Govindacharya's remarks
Namaste

Recently in some Whatsapp groups and FB someone circulated an audio of
noted Madhva scholar Sri Bannanje Govindacharya in Kannda. It was clarified
later that this audio is only a clipping of a larger one which comprised of
his class on a text of his school to his students at home very long ago.
What created a furor among followers of Shankaracharya is his remarks on
Shankara that one can at once say are unsavory.  The gist of his remarks is:

Shankara does not allow/want anyone to question; what he says is to be
accepted.

There is no answer to the question 'whose is avidya?' in Shankara's system.
The scholar cites a few lines from Shankara's Gita bhashya 13.2 where a
dialogue is used by Shankara to bring out from the questioner's mouth the
answer to the question.  However, the scholar aborts the dialogue
prematurely and concludes 'there is no reply to this question.'

Two senior scholars of Advaita have recorded their replies to the above, in
Kannada and clarified the matter. In the file uploaded in this URL, I have
included all these audios, cited the Gita and Brihadaranyaka Bhashyam,
their translation in English and Kannada (from images of Sri SSS's
translation):

Subsequently, a disciple of Sri Bannanje Acharya has released an audio in
reply to the above rejoinders, in Kannada. However, he has not touched on
the core matter but meandered into various other topics. I have not
referred to this in the above file.

warm regards
