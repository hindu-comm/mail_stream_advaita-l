Oh, but avidyA is material cause.

Just take A=Brahma-jnAna and B= A's effect = ~shoka-moha. It will make

I'm sure you yourself can see the error in such justification. There is
vaishamyadosha. The effect is an abhAvarUpa here and cause is bhAvarUpa!

For simplicity, let's say I more or less agree with your example case.
However, there is vaishamya here as well...

... As is the case with AtmA. One knows not oneself as brahman but one
starts explaining oneself as if one knows oneself using the BMI.

One has to associate both shaktis to avidyA as well, else lacking vikshepa,
avidyA won't be able to project a snake. If one sees a snake, since it's
mAyAshakti, everyone would see snake!

Lack of knoweldge is one thing but projection of something else where the

I understand that this simplistic approach maybe helpful but it may as well
be said that vikshepa goes away when the sharIra, kArya, goes away; or if
you prefer: individuality, avidyAkArya, has gone away with avidyAnAsha but
the world seen, mAyAkArya, remains (but not seen separately from oneself
since avidyA is gone).
