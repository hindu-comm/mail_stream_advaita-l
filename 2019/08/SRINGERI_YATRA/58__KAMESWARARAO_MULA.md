PRADOSHA KALA SHAKTHI GANAPATHI ABHISHEGAM DATES @ 6PM at the Ganesh temple back side of Sarada ambal temple, SRINGERI
SEPTEMBER 11, 26, OCT 11, 25, NOVEMBER 9TH
MAHA PRADOSHA ABHISHEGAM / PUJA ON 24TH NOVEMBER.
THIS IS DONE BY A GROUP OF 40-50 VEDIC STUDNET WHO ARE AT THE AGE <20 YRS, who are learning vedas at sringeri python, do the Rudra, namaka, chamaka, srisukta, purushasukta, Ganapathi adharvana seesrhsa parayana at a stretch with a single melodious voice of renounce frequency, and whole place inside the temple resounds with that voice. one can make use of this great opportunity with out ayn tkt also.
I witnessed this puja for 1.5 hrs, it was really resonating to listen the excellent vedic chanting from the youngsters who are just going to start their carrier. Offcouse, i missed to record that as it was denied by the temple authorities.
Lord Ganesha walks down / passes through that powerful vedic chantings in his quartet through out the puja & one can feel that easily with bliss automatically comes from eyes in the form of tears if you join them with your skills, & although it takes some time to me to catch the frequency and cope up the high resonating frequency of that young vedic students of stringer peetham.
My humble prostations to the lotus feet of Jagadguru shankaracharya of sringeri peetham to nurturing the young boys in the sanataa advaita vedica marga in a very systamatic way. I also learnt this is done to the young vatuka's at free of cost and who can spend their valuable time of at least 5yrs at their veda pathasala. They are provided with free food / free accommodation to the needy.

Dear Members,               It was again the opportunity of the Lotus Feet & indeed my mother's Grace that I could able to go to my first ever maiden visit to Sringeri and spend couple of days there at the Lotus feet. I could able to ask many queries to the Lotus Feet and get it clarified from the Shankaracharya & which I will be giving the details of the changes in yagnopavita dharana, procedures in my subsequent mails.
My Sincere thanks to Sh. V. Subrahamanyam Ji for his excellent guidance and help in accommodation there towards my holy tip. Although, I thought to meet you sir, but due to my tight schedule , I couldn't able to meet you.

My objective to give all these details with you is not for an advertizement sake, If any one interested in knowing the details, & stay arrangements for Sringeri visit, they can mail me personally so that I can give all the details & phone numbers.
During the Chaturmasya Vrata Deiskha kala time , On a acuspicous junciton of  Ekdadasi/Dwadasi, i could able to touch the lotus feet for his divine blessings & performed the Sahasara Modaka Homa at the Lotus feet Yaga Sala on a Trayodasi tidhi. Wow, What an eternal oportunity given by the lotus feet to me to do Purnahuti & Ganesa Sahasranama Archana in the presence of eight(8) Brahmins and spent most valubale time at the Sarada Peetham.
I Witnessed the Swamiji's performed Chandra Moulieswara Puja for both the days from 8PM to 10PM.

Once again my sincere thanks to Subrahamanian garu for my smooth stay there which I reincorporate with gratitude.
