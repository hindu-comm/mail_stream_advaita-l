Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Weekend with Wisdom - A new program by Indic
Academy
To: <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Pranaams to All,

I am happy to announce a new program ' Weekend with Wisdom'.

Under this we are inviting scholars and a small group of 5-6 research
students and committed public intellectuals to spend a weekend together so
that there is deeper engagement and learning at an offsite venue. You can
read more about this initiative here

Regards

Hari
