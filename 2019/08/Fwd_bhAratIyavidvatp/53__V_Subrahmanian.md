*5/5: Vakyartha Sadas | Brahmasri Mani Dravid on Traditional Pedagogy*
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCoAuDlwhIo>

"Prof. K.S.Kannan summarises the event. Brahmasri Mani Dravid, speaks in
Hindi on the nature of traditional pedagogy. The reason for much of Western
Indology’s misinterpretations derive from the lack of a valid context in
their learning and understanding. Irrespective of the motives of the
(western or otherwise) scholars, knowledge is to be acquired based on its
actual basis and evolution from the actual practitioners of the
knowledge.The guru-sishya parampara and the primarily oral tradition of
pedagogy are explicated. Watch Part 4 of this series here:
