It's my pleasure to inform you that an online course on  " Intermediate
Level of Spoken Sanskrit " will be offered on Swayam portal.

The video lectures will be delivered by Sister Dr. Anuradha Choudry from
IIT Kharagpur from Aug.26,2019. Please note that the course is made
available free of cost to learners on Swayam Platform( under the Ministry
of HRD, Government of India). However, learners wanting a certificate will
have to appear for exams after completing the weekly assignments on payment
of nominal free.

Those we are interested are required  to sign up to create a Swayam account
or  can log in using their Google or Facebook account credentials  to
access this course .

The cut off date for registration is Aug.26,2019.

Please note that the videos of the  prior course on " Introduction to Basic
Spoken Sanskrit "   are available as mentioned in the trail mail.

I request you to kindly share it with all so that those who are interested
to learn Sansakrit can enroll themselves to derive the benefit.


P:S - Sanskrit is the  ' Deva Bhasha ' or the language of the Gods and
mother of all languages. It is  not restricted to spirituality, philosophy,
or literature alone,  experts believe that the language is most appropriate
for writing algorithms besides use in machine learning and artificial
intelligence as the language is most suitable to computers.
