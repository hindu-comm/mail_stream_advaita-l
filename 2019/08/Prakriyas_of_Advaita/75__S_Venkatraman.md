Advaita Vedanta has several Prakriyas like Pancha Kosha Prakriya, Avastatraya Prakriya, Drg Drishya Prakriya etc which are used by adherents as a part of their manana to arrive at the truth. Is there an article or a book which covers all or nearly all the Prakriyas of Advaita Vedanta? If there is one, would appreciate receiving information on the same and how I may get a copy for myself. Many thanks and with pranams, 

Venkat
