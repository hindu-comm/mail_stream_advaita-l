praNAms Sri Raghava prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Maybe you have heard of the panchadashi verse which gels with what you wrote.

IxaNAdi- praveshantA srishtir ishEna kalpitA;

 jagradadi-vimoxAntah samsaro jiva- kalpitaH

I vaguely remember this verse figures in one of the lesser known upaniShads. Need to check it up.

  *   Thanks for the reference from paNchadashi.  When Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji explaining the drushti-srushti vAda based on Sri madhusUdana Saraswati work, if I remember right, he said there is a provision to accept Ishwara srushti as well in this vAda.
AFAIK no Acharya from northern indian traditional shAnkara peethams and maThams like the ancient daxiNAmUrti maTham of vArANasI or the brahmaleen Swami rAmAnandaji of Markandeya sannyAsAshram, Omkareshwar or niranjanI peeth, all of whom who are proficient in both prasthAnatrayam bhAShya and also nyAya and brihatprasthAnam, have found fault with mUlAvidyA or dRShTi-sRShTi prakriyas.


√ò     And they all agree that mAya and avidyA both are paryAya pada-s and avidyA lesha to paramArtha jnAni, avidyA is bhAva rUpa padArtha  as well ??  just curious to know as I am not familiar with their upanyAsa-s on shankara vedAnta.

So the Acharya mentioned by you discoursing  in hindi was in all likelihood merely teaching SDV without prejudice to DSV.


√ò     That might be the case, I think this discourse was in either Aasta or samskaar TV.

 It's interestingly only the Mattur-based Acharyas who have a different take on mUlAvidyA and mAyA-avidyA difference etc. Only Nagesha Bhatta in mediaeval times asserted abhAva-vAda.


√ò     Sri SSS clarified in one of his works that how his view points are NOT in line with Sri Nagesha Bhatta and he clearly said that he is not echoing Nagesh Bhatta‚Äôs version of advaita.  And in this list itself one of the prabhuji-s branded Sri SSS‚Äôs method of interpretation of shankara vedAnta as ‚Äúmattur prakriya‚Äù üòä brahmAshrita avidyA prakriya, jeevAshrita avidyA prakriya can be added to this.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
