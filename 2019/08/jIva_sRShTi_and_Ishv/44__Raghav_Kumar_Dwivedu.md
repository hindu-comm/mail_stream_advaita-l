Namaste Bhaskarji
Maybe you have heard of the panchadashi verse which gels with what you
wrote.

IxaNAdi- praveshantA srishtir ishEna kalpitA;

 jagradadi-vimoxAntah samsaro jiva- kalpitaH


I vaguely remember this verse figures in one of the lesser known
upaniShads. Need to check it up.

AFAIK no Acharya from northern indian traditional shAnkara peethams and
maThams like the ancient daxiNAmUrti maTham of vArANasI or the brahmaleen
Swami rAmAnandaji of Markandeya sannyAsAshram, Omkareshwar or niranjanI
peeth, all of whom who are proficient in both prasthAnatrayam bhAShya and
also nyAya and brihatprasthAnam, have found fault with mUlAvidyA or
dRShTi-sRShTi prakriyas.

So the Acharya mentioned by you discoursing  in hindi was in all likelihood
merely teaching SDV without prejudice to DSV.

 It's interestingly only the Mattur-based Acharyas who have a different
take on mUlAvidyA and mAyA-avidyA difference etc. Only Nagesha Bhatta in
mediaeval times asserted abhAva-vAda.
