Abinava Shakaralaya

Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati attached great
importance to his first camp at Mysore. Was it
not the birth place of his guru? The temple in
his  honour  had  been  completed.  The
Mahaswami’s first assignment, on his first tour,
was to consecrate this temple. What could be
more pleasing to him? The temple had been
named ‘Abhinava Shankaralaya’.

A marble statue of Sri Narasimha Bharati
Mahaswami was installed in the temple which
was declared open by the Mahaswami. This was
the second occasion for the Mahaswami to pay
a concrete tribute to his guru. Eight years earlier
he had done so at Sringeri.

Gift of Sharada

Form Mysore, the Mahaswami proceeded to
Satyamangalam	via   Nanjangud   and
Chamarajanagar. At Satyamangalam, the first
halt of the Mahaswami in Tamil Nadu, a
tumultuous welcome awaited him.

After completing the evening worship the
Mahaswami who had scant knowledge of Tamil
began his speech in chaste Tamil. The choicest
words fell into their proper place in mellifluous
Tamil as if coming out of a natural spring. It
was like pouring nectar into the ears of the large
gathering. Never once did the Mahaswami falter.

One might say that this address, fully in
Tamil, was the first public evidence of the fact
that the Mahaswami had become a great pavana
purusha-a saint to whom the various siddhis
(powers) had come naturally, unsought.

Otherwise it is impossible to explain how the
Mahaswami could speak Tamil as fluently as in
his own mother-tongue when he hardly knew
the language. To the Mahaswami everything was
the gift of the Goddess Sharada.

In later years his successor Sri Abhinava Vidya
Tirtha Mahaswami used to be amazed at the
manner in which the Mahaswami would know
even the unexpressed problems of the devotees,
and solve them. Whenever he asked the
Mahaswami in wonder, the Mahaswami would
never admit his powers but would only submit
the credit to Sharadambal.
