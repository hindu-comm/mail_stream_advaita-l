It was great reading your post on the subject...Marvellous to read about the great jivanmukta.  

Many couldn't even fathom the greatness of His Holiness and considered Him as a mad man
in sringeri.  Quite often He was locked inside lest move in the streets of sringeri naked like 
Sadasiva Brahmendra Saraswati Ji.  

Shri. Gopalakrishna Sastry (who taught tarka to bharati tirtha swamiji) was a young lad of 15 at 
that time.  When he used to go near Swamiji and used to get frightened as His Holiness used to 
behave like bAla, unmatta & pishAcha.  Once, he was spit by Swamiji and the next day Swamiji
called the Sastry and caressed him and advised him to go to Kashi for higher studies in Tarka and
Vedanta and approach Shri.Dravida Rajeshwara Sastrigal in Kashi for studies. 

That said, the passing away of His Holiness is also a great mystery because Swamiji made up His 
mind to shed His mortal coil in Tunga river and drowned Himself.  But Lo ! His Holiness mortal
coil was floating in Tunga River with padma-asana posture and holding the gesture of 'chinmudra'
and shone like Daskhinamurti.  It was the fateful day of Mahalaya Amavasya.
