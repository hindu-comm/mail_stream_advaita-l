Dear Members,            The chandogya gives us a unique path of travel out of each activity of universe through the prism of chants and it is derived from the word "Chandas". If the Chandas by the Rishi is decorated by an Alankara then it will be a " BHUSHAN" for the Individual.
Chandogya presents a five to seven fold structure through which all human nature can be seen, may be simply we can say through all the seven power enters (chakras) , one can realize the self and can reach the lotus feet. The five fold pattern i.e Panchagni can be easily understood from the story ofSvetaketu, Learned son of Sage Uddalak who is known for hisextraordinary Guru Bhakthi / service. Uddalalaka's son svetakeru on his travels mets the king Pravahana Jaivali and questions him on the purpose of Knowledge. The king answers all the question of Svetaketu and explains in detail to his father uddalalka which is known to all of us as Chandogya Upanishad. The panting are osmosis, Earth, wind, sky, fuel of the sun gives the way to rise of the moon.
Chandgoya views all the creation is arised from the yagna sacrifice only, where every activity is interconnected. The birth of the child is not just a simple out come between joy of man & woman , but it is a law of karma, can be explained as it is from the mathematical harmony of the natal chart of all i.e mother, father, sister, brother & the individual. It may be a complicated formula & can be understood by the individual himself and can't be explained to all. One can know this in realisation only.
On the occasion of Rakshbandhan , it is said that, the there is no friend like a sister in a calm & stormy weather (quote copied from Times). They are called a s Bhaginis as they are sharing us or travelling along with us from the mothers yoni and protecting from us from any evil effects.Happy Raksha bhandhan to all my sisters.
73rd INDEPENDENCY DAY WISHES TO ALL MY COUNTRY RESIDENTS.
Sri Guru Padaravindarpana MastuKameswara
