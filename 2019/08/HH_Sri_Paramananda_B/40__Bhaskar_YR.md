Namaste Bhaskar ji
You seem to have missed a crucial point made by Sri Venkatraghavan ji viz., ; *तथैव भावात्मकताभावानाम् ।"  * in the context of ghatAbhAvaH being nothing but san-pataH or san-something else. So even this category called abhAva is bhAvAtmikA.

I have said in one of my today's mails that jnAnAbhAva is kevala shabda vikalpa to get the knowledge of something that is abhAva.  If the ajnAna is jnAnAbhAva it should not be congnized but an ignorant person know that he has ajnAna if it is not bhAvarUpa what else is this??  Hence knowing that I don’t know is also bhAva rUpa only.  is the gist of tathaiva bhAvAtmaktAbhAvAnAM.  But we are forgetting the fact that we are talking about the jneya  ajnAna which does not create any buddhi vrutti when talking about abhAva jnana hence it is called shabda vikalpa to drive home the point that there is an absence of knowledge on something.  We know a lot about Atma jnana/ our true svarUpa by shravaNAdi sAdhana but still the yathArtha jnana is absent in our buddhi vrutti to declare that I am the jnAni.  The yathArtha jnAna's absence (vishesha svarUpa jnana) despite the existence of sAmAnya jnana is called jnAnAbhAva and this is not bhAvAtmaka as this is ONLY shabda vikalpa.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
