Namaste Sudhanshu ji
You write -
"I am also in awe of mind-boggling details to which
Chitsukhi/Advaita-siddhi goes.

Though appealing, the arguments such as Brahman becoming sarvajna through
avidya, have been adequately addressed in sampradAya."

critical word "not" in the above para you wrote to express your idea?
