Further as per him, unlike SSS, Maya is not kalpita due to avidya (if I understand SSS correct here).

We have to be very careful while interpreting Sri SSS words.  Yes, at most of the places Sri SSS says mAya is avidyA kalpita (fictiously imagined by avidyA based on bhAshya vAkya-s like avidyAtmikA hi beeja shaktiH avyakta shabda nirdeshya, avidyAkalpitena cha nAmarUpa lakshaNena rUpabhedena vyAkrutAvyAkrutAtmakena etc.) but context in which we have to understand that vAkruta (nAma rUpa)  and avyAkruta (beeja shaktiH) both are avidyA kalpita is whenever they are viewed separate from brahman it is mere figment of avidyA.  But when this ‚Äòshakti is realized as brahmAnanya‚Äô there is no anAtma whatsoever apart from brahman.  If you know kannada I would like to quote here from Sri SSS‚Äôs one of the Kannada works : avyAkruta nAma rUpagaLu tamma AtmasvarUpavannu ettukonde vyAkrutavAguttade.  ‚Äú NAAMA RUPAGALIGE BRAHMAVE SVARUPAVU‚Äù AADARE BRAHMAKKE NAAMA RUPAGALU SVARUPAVALLA‚Äù egalu ella kadeyalliyu Atmane eruttaaneye horatu berondilla, AATMANIGINTA BEREYAADA ANAATMA VEMBUDU ELLIYU ENDIGU ERUVUDE ELLA.   It is just because : tasmAt kAraNasya Atma bhUtA shaktiH, shakteshcha Atma bhUtaM kAryaM.  And finally all these details have been floated just to drive home the point that ornaments are nothing but GOLD but GOLD is NOT ornament on the GOLD nAma rUpa adhyArOpita since GOLD was / is / will always be nirvishesha and nirlipta.  Itareya bhAshya 1-1-1 would be more relevant with regard to this.  And Lord‚Äôs declaration in Geeta : yasmAt mama prakrutiH yOniH kAraNaM sarva bhUtAnAM, ‚Ä¶..prakrutidvayadvAreNa (chetanAcheetana prakruti) ahaM sarvajnaH IshwarO jagataH kAraNaM‚Ä¶.If unwarrantedly equates avidyA with mAya/prakruti then brahman becomes sarvajna through his avidyA üòä so absurd is it not?? üòä

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
