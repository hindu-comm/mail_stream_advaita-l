Namaste Sri Sadananda

Clear example of Avarana and Vikshepa is like this. Our father used to tell
us when we were going to the exam. 'Don't leave any question in the exam.
Always write something. If you write something the examiner can give some
marks if he wants. But if you leave any question with blank answer he has
to give zero marks for it.'

But this advice will not be good for Multiple  Choice Questions with
negative marking. If you leave any question without answering you will get
zero. But if you write wrong answer you will get negative marks like -1, -2
and so on.

No answer or blank answer = Deep sleep state Here there is no rope seen and
no snake also. No fear.
Wrong answer = Dream or Waking State. Here rope is seen as snake. Fear.

There is negative experience = Dukha experience in Dream and Waking. But no
experience in Deep sleep.
