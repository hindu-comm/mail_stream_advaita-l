PraNAms Sadaji,
Yes, if one sees any benefit in separating mAya and avidyA, one can do so.

praNAms Sri Venkatraghavan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

There is a huge benefit in treating avidyA and mAya from different perspective based on siddhAnta samanvaya.  Let that be aside, what is the exact meaning of avidyA and mAya as per standard  Sanskrit  dictionary ??  grammatical origination of these two words??  The etymological meaning of both words is one and the same barring its usage in vedAnta.  Just curious to know.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
