Dear Venkat ji,

Very interesting post.  From the above bhashya lines, I would think that
since in Advaita Brahman is the only Real, the only existent entity without
a second of any type, and since this Existence can never go out of
existence, (na abhavo vidyate satah), the very idea of abhava is untenable
in the ultimate point of view. Abhava of anything (which has to be in
vyavahara only) is also a superimposition in Brahman, a manifestation,
vivarta, of Brahman, and hence it is all only bhaava rupa.

I would like to hear your view on this.

warm regards
subbu
