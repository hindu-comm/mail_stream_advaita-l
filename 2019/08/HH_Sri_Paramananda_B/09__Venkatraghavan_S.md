You can take it as tattvAnyatvAbhyAm anirvachanIyam. Shankara Bhagavatpada
mentions it 2-3 times in the sUtrabhAShya.

You can call agrahaNAtmaka avidyA as jnAnAbhAva if you want, but all the
brihadAraNyaka bhAShya is saying is *yadi* ajnAnam jnAnAbhAvamiti *ucyate*
tadApi tat jnAnenaiva nivartate, not ajnAnasya jnAnAbhAvatvarUpatvAt tat
jnAnenaiva nivartate. The purpose of the quote is to say that only jnAna
removes ajnAna, not to prove the abhAvarUpatva of ajnAna.

No, I don't understand the relevance of that here.

Of course. The jnAna abhAva is not the abhAva of the thing on the table,
but the abhAva of the jnAna.

Yes, but visheSha abhava cannot have sAmAnyadharmatvAvacChinna
pratiyogitAkatvam. The pratiyogitAvacChedakam of a visheSha abhava has to
be some visheSha dharma only. So if you say you don't know something
specific about your computer, unless you know what that specific thing is,
you cannot say that you don't know that specific thing. But if you know
that specific thing, you cannot not know it. If you insist that a
particular absence can have a generic attribute of counterpositiveness,
then even a ground with a pot on it can be said to be a ground without pot.

So what?

pratiyogi is nAnatva vishiShTam. Which jnAna I have through pratyakshAdi.

That is why it was that said by bhAvarUpa all that is meant is abhAva
vilakshaNam.

The term padArtha in nyAya is used for both abhAva and bhAva rUpa vastu. So
there is no requirement that it becomes an existent thing just because of
padArtha. Also, abhAva vilakshaNa does not necessarily mean bhAva either.
In advaita, when we say jagat is sadasat vilakshaNa, we don't say it is sat
just because it happens to be asat vilakshaNa.

If you permit me to say, terming avidyA as abhAva vilakshaNam and it is

Not sure what you mean by this being an attempt to obfuscate. I have no
need to do any such thing. If you wish to continue this discussion further,
first please withdraw that statement.
