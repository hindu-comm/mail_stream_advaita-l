Hari Om Bhaskar prabhu ji,

I find the arguments of both sampradAya as well as by SSS/Swami Paramananda
Bharati ji as very very strong.

I am also in awe of mind-boggling details to which Chitsukhi/Advaita-siddhi
goes.

Though appealing, the arguments such as Brahman becoming sarvajna through
avidya, have been adequately addressed in sampradAya.

We need to keep a window always open imho. Since everything is
fundamentally based on a belief of pramAnatva of Shruti -- I don't discount
the possibility that our entire VedAnta itself may not be correct (no
matter how pointless our lives become then). And hence adequate respect to
science need to be given. And therefore I get shocks when I read things
like darkness being some stuff.

Regards.
Sudhanshu.
