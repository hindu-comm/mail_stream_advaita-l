Namaste Bhaskar ji,
I hope you don't mind me if I don't reply to everything in your email.

The point of this discussion is not to convince anyone of the rightness of
one position and wrongness of the other, but merely to explain one's
position so that even if we don't achieve agreement on the issues, we can
at least achieve an understanding of what the other person is saying.

Because it is not anirvachanIya meaning inexpressible, it is
tattvAnyatvAbhyAm anirvachanIya, meaning inexpressible as sat or asat.

It is a sopAdhika bhrama, as long as the upAdhi (prArabdha / body /mind) is
present, the appearance of illusion persists even if the ignorance is
destroyed.

I am not sure where this is, but without context, it is difficult to gauge
its relevance. If the meaning is yathAshrutam then it would equally apply
to the general definition of vikalpa vritti (whose objects are tucCha) in
yoga sUtra - shabdajnAnAnupAti vastu shUnyo vikalpa:, but I doubt that
bhAShyakAra would say ajnAna is tucCha in nature, because he talks quite
often about how this world, Ishvara's Ishvaratvam, jIva's jIvatvam is
avidyAkalpitam.

In any case, if jnAna abhAva means presence of sAmAnya jnAna but absence of
visheSha jnAna, how does one even know what these visheSha-s are? If one
knows them, then how can one say there is absence of the knowledge of
visheSha-s? If one doesn't know them, then how can one say what one doesn't
know is absent?

To avoid this, if it is said I have sAmAnya jnAna of viSheSha, but not the
visheSha jnAna of viSheSha-s, how does one know what is the visheSha jnAna
of viSheSha? For this, one would have to postulate another sAmAnya jnAna of
the visheSha jnAna of the visheSha which is known, and a visheSha jnAna of
the visheSha jnAna of the visheSha, which is not known. But how is that the
nature of absence? It would need another sAmAnya and visheSha jnAna,
leading to infinite regress and infinite number of jnAna-s. And even in the
end, the question remains how does one know if that something is absent
without knowing what that thing is.

To make matters worse, we started off expecting to cognise the abhAva of
one jnAna and all we ended up is cognising the existence of many jnAna-s.

This has been elaborated in other emails in the thread. You may want to
read them to see if the explanation there makes sense.

The same principle applies for bhAvarUpa ajnAna also.

Do you mean pratiyogi jnAna is abhAva jnAna virodhi? If so, that is
correct. But I still don't see why it would rule out bhAva rUpa ajnAna. It
is only if ajnAna is abhAvarUpa that its cognisance requires pratiyogi
jnAna. If it is bhAvarUpa, there is no requirement for pratiyogi jnAna to
cognise ajnAna. It is sAkshi vedya, that is, it is revealed by sAkshi
without the need for a pratiyogi jnAna in the form of a pramANa vritti.

The ones I have been exposed to mean it to be sadasatvilakshaNa rUpa
avidyA. Some call it bhAvarUpa, some call it abhAva vilakshaNa, but the
object is the same. Madhusudana sarasvati says that by bhAvarUpa it means
abhAva vilakshaNa.

Again, please only take this email as something for information purposes,
it is not meant to disprove anything or convince anyone.
