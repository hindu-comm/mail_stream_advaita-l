Hari Om Venkataraghavan ji,

I am aware that in nyAya, in order to know abhAva-A, we need to have prior
knowledge of A. And this is logical also.

However, let us take an example where though I don't know A,  I know the
effects of A. And therefore, I can make an inference of abhAva of A by the
fact of abhAva of A's effects. The abhAva of effects of A will prove abhAva
of A. (A = Brahma-jnAna, A's effect = ~shoka-moha)

Will it not be a case where I can know the abhAva of A without knowing A as
such? And hence the argument -- ajnAna cannot be jnAna-abhAva for it
requires upfront knowledge of Brahma-jnAna -- may not be valid in VedAnta
(though in nyAya, it is a sound argument).

Regards.
Sudhanshu.
