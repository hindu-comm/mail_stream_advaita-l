Praveenji - PraNAms
My understanding may be wrong. Bavaruupatvam requires not just existence but should have a capacity to project.
If someone asks me ' Do you know gaagaabuubu?"
I can say -never heard of it. I do not know what it is? - response by my mind? - at this stage only aavarana due to avidya. When someone points to object on the floor that I also see, and he says that is 'gaagaabuubu'. Now the ignorance of gaagaabuubu is gone. At this stage, there is no vikshepa involved. - only the naama aspect is established - just one example.
Projection can start only if have some partial knowledge of an object but not complete knowledge as it - there is an object there - 5 feet long - coiled - soft when I stopped on it and is lying on the aisle. 'There is (something)' - the projection of the mind viskhepa later as it is a snake, etc.
Question is only do we attribute the vikshepa shakti to avidya or to the mind which is empowered by maaya shakti at the individual level to project the snake on the object that is perceived with incomplete attributes?
Lack of knoweldge is one thing but projection of something else where the object is different -to separate the aavarana vs vishepa - or ignorance vs maaya.
This may be samantics but separation makes it easy to comprehend that muula avidya is gone but projection continues for a jeevan mukta as long as BMI losts.
