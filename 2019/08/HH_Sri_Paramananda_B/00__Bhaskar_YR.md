One interesting aspect of his approach was to question panchikaraNam as usually understood. He was also not in favour of the dRShTi-sRShTi prakriyas.

Hare Krishna

My humble prostrations to this swamiji, long time back if I remember right, I had attended one of his discourses here in Bengaluru at prashanta gaNapati devasthAna.  And if I am right, like Sri SSS, he is not part with treating avidyA and mAya as synonyms, painting avidyA lesha to jnAni, avidyA is bhAva rUpa etc.   

And with regard to DS & SD vAda, one of the vedAnta discourser (forgot his name) was saying : seeing the sAmAnya in Ishwara srushti is srushti-drushti vAda, in this vAda there is no room to add any visheshaNa.  For example we have to look Ishwara srushti 'rose' as rose only without adding any attributes to it.  So that drushti will always be on srushti of Ishwara without adding anything of his own.  Whereas when one adds the visheshaNa to Ishwara srushti it becomes 'drushti-srushti', like rose is big/small, less petals / more petals, red/maroon, thick fragrance / less scented one etc.  this visheshaNa is srushti of an individual which is subjective varies from individual to individual gives room to drushti-srushti. So, according to him even drushti-srushti vAda is within the sphere of Ishwara srushti where visheshaNa added to already existing Ishwara srushti. He has not quoted any reference for this and the discourse was in Hindi (some North Indian swamiji it seems).   Do we find any reference for this type of definition in mUla / prakaraNa grantha-s??  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
