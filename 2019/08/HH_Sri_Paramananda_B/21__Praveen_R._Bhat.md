Its only the other way around that you can infer the presence of cause by
presence of effect or absence of effect by absence of cause. The absence of
pot doesn't necessarily mean absence of clay, but presence of pot means
presence of clay or absence of clay means absence of pot.

No, as above, its erroneous.

Truly so, Venkatji. There is no insistence of bhAvarUpatvam but
yatkinchidbhAvarUpatvam is abhAvavilakShaNatvam or mithyAtvam. Since its
kArya is seen, it cannot be non-existent.

Since the AvaraNa is said to be eliminated, it has to exist to be
eliminated; in that, it was necessarily bhAvarUpa. In such a case, its
kAraNa cannot be abhAvarUpa.

The bhAvarUpatvam or not doesn't change this understanding.
