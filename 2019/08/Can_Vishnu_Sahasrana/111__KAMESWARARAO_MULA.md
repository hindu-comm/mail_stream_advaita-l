Dear Sir,       It can be chanted anytime,anywhere:Yes I do agree, it can be done, but a Groupchanting will give more Fruitfullresults. My Earlier answer is for the question of auspicious time to chant.
How ever, I have areference from the Nam avatar:Sitaramdas Omkarnath(17 February 1892 â€“ 6 December 1982) was an Indian saint from Bangal. He preached spiritual path to countless devotees from all over the world, with importance to chanting NAM /SAMKEERRTANAM
According to Omkarnath NamameantNamaof God; Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Durga; butNamahad to be repeated constantly.Namacould reach the SADHAKAto NADA andJyoti( Divine Sounds and Lights) and ultimately Name could bring, OMKARthe Anahat sound one could hear inside. So what the Rishi of the old days could not gain even after hundred of years of TAPASYAin mountains/forests, Nama could achieve even when a person lived his normal life and did his every day work.
Sitaramdas Omkarnath's spiritual philosophy encompassed BHAKTI, JNANA, KARMA, KARMA / KRIYA YOGAand all segments of ancient Indian religion, with emphasis on Nam [Lord's Name]. Sitaramdas did not promote conversion, but guided all seekers on the path of their respective religion. He said- 'The paths may differ, but HE is not different.' By holding onto the Holy Name of Lord, and by performing the duties prescribed by religion of oneself, everybody can attain the Supreme Truth.The teachings of Omkarnath derive from his personal experiences, revealed in the course of a lifelong and continual spiritual practice. His teachings were compiled by Kinkar Omananda (alias Madhav Swamiji), his closest monastic disciple.
I have a firm belief in Sri Sitaram Das's Words & works, He is really a Nama - avatar.
Individuals may differ in their opinions & it is purely my view and belief.
