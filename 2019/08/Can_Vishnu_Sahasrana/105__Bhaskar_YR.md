AFAIK, there is no restrictions as such since it is a stOtra not mantra.  There is traditionally some restrictions not to chant AraNyaka / Upanishad mantra-s (like aruNa prashna, taittireeya, mahAnArAyaNa etc.) after sunset.  I have seen in satya naraayana vratOdyApana, sudarshana hOma etc. VS stOtra chanted continuously all through the night during the pooja / hOma.  Anyway this is my view point.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
