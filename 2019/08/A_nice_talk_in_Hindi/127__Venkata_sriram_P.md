Namaste,

The current peethadhipati of Manik Prabhu Samsthan gives good discourses
on advaita in simple hindi which even a layman can understand.  

I have seen that audiences consists of both elders & youngster alike. 

Did Sringeri & Manik Prabhu Samsthaan maintain any relations earlier ?

Because, generally, Sringeri doesn't visit these type of samsthaans & adhipatis unless
they belong to smaartha sampradaya and advaita in particular.  I am aware that both
Kanchi & Sringeri visit Ganagapura Samsthaan where the nirguna paadukaas of 
Nrisimha Saraswati are placed.  

It is believed that few of famous dattatreya avataars in the present
age are shripada srivallabha, nrisimha saraswati, Akkalkot Maharaj,
Manik Prabhu, Shirdi Saibaba, Gajanan Maharaj of Shegaon, 
Narayan Maharaj of Khedgaon etc.  

However, strangely, Sringeri visit Nrisimha Saraswati and of late visited
Mani Nagar.  This samsthaan is a blend of advaita & sufi siddhanta 
and darbaar used to be conducted.  Even the attire of peethadhipatis
of Manik Samsthaan looks like darbaar dress.

rgs,
sriram
