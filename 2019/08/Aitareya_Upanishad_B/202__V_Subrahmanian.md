In the Vedanta Paribhasha, the very first mangala shloka is:

यदविद्याविलासेन भूतभौतिकसृष्टयः ।  तं नौमि परमात्मानं सच्चिदानन्दविग्रहम् ॥ १॥


Here it is said: By whose avidya vilaasa this entire creation has come
out, I pray to that Paramatman.


Here it is clear that this avidya is of Paramatma. How can there be
avidya for Paramatma? We have to take it as the maya shakti of
Paramatma.
