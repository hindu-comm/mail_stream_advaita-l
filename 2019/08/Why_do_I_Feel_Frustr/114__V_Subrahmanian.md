A crisp and profound 20-min answer from Swami Sarvapriyananda (as usual)
for this classical and very old question - why do I feel frustrated after
studying Vedanta? Swamji explains deep concepts like Asambhavana, Viparita
Bhavana, Jivan Mukti Viveka in a simple language drawing from the direct
teachings - from Sri Vidyaranya to Ma Sri Sarada Devi.

warm regards
subbu
