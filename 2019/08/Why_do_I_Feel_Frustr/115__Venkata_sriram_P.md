Nice video ...

I would have been much happier had swamiji adorned with bhaska on forehead....I never saw him 
with bhasma...Hindu monks sans bhasma, rudraksha look like प्रच्छन्न बौद्घः 

It is our tradition to have bhasma / urdhwa-pundra with gopi-chandana etc. depending upon the guru-parampara.  
In our advaita tradition, bhasma-dhAraNa is must for sanyasis and tonsured head should be covered with शाटिका.

Of course, all these are immaterial for hamsa / parama-hamsa.  

It is for them to decide.  Swami Dayananda ji used to have bhasma-dharana and cover his shirO-muNDana with 
ocre robes.

Just my observation.

rgs,
sriram
