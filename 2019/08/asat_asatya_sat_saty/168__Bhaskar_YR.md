States of Consciousness seem to be incorrect. Should be states of Avastha, right?

>  avasthA itself means state is it not like jagradavasthA (waking state), svapnAvasthA (dream state) etc. ??  Atman (consciousness) appears as different like (vaishvAnara, taizasa, prAjnA etc.) in these states due to upAdhi saMbandha and upAdhi upashanta states.  I donâ€™t think anything wrong with this statement as it has been said for our understanding purpose.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
