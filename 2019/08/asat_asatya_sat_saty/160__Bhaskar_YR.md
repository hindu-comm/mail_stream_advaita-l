Yes,  the new aged more logical, scientific and authentic  approach should openly be adopted to many other stands in vedAnta as well.  If I am not wrong, this  includes that of unceremoniously arguing in favour of obsolete stand of something in the name of shraddha / bhakti in tradition or blindly accepting some illogical conclusions as  axioms.  But, unfortunately most of us afraid to question / doubt this as these things more significantly hold water in tradition since the time immemorial and more importantly these things  have the stamp of our traditional Acharya-s.

Coming back to recent Advaita acharya-s with scientific background, I am really curious to know what would be the explanation of Sri Dayananda Saraswati or paramArthAnanda Saraswati of Arsha Vidya with regard to tamas, whether it  is dravya / bhAva padArtha as traditionally explained??  Recently I read one of the hardcore followers of Sri SDS saying, Sri SDS clarified that attributing prArabdha karma phala to jnAni is like, after the death of a  person who had three wives,  rejecting  the vaidhavya to one patni  and declaring other two wives are widows ðŸ˜Š  BTW, what is Sri SDSâ€™s take on jnAniâ€™s avidyA lesha, his prArabdha, his rAga-dvesha etc. Any work of swamiji  available with regard to these issues ??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

It is very difficult to continue in traditional line because in first step only you need to counter their exotic and patently incorrect concepts of darkness, colour, perception etc. The entire mobile technology clearly proves that their ideas regarding darkness etc are simply incorrect. We have night vision glasses. We live in a different world now with huge scientific progress. Even if Shankara himself had written like this, I would not have hesitated to move away. I don't know what SSS holds regarding darkness, colour, perception etc.

Swamiji being a scientist himself could not probably accept these things. Though I had never discussed this issue with him, I had same troubles. One doesn't get any shraddha.

Sudhanshu.

  1.  Avidya is jnana-abhAva as per Swamiji.


  *   Oh!! Thanks for the clarification again.  Even Sri SSS also says avidyA is abhAva rUpa only and mUlAvidyA or kAraNAvidyA or bhAva rUpa avidyA which is upAdAna kAraNa for adhyAsa is alien to shankara vedAnta.  avidyA has to be abhAva rUpa only  because of the simple fact that after jnana jnAni realizes that he was / is / will never be ajnAni and always brahman only.   His realization is not like, yes, before AtmajnAna, there existed something called ajnAna / avidyA and after jnana, that jnana in the place of ajnAna / avidyA comes and occupied that place or avidyA which is existent will be replaced by vidyA.


  1.  He has quoted Chitsukhacharya and Anubhuti swarup acharya at one place. Though I am sure that he did not agree with them at other places.


  *   Were these Acharya-s said avidyA is abhAva rUpa in their vyAkhyAna??  Very interesting.  If yes, then abhAva rUpa avidyA is not an exclusive observation of Sri SSS or this Swamiji.


  1.  I have not come across such interpretation as of his in any of the ancient advaita Vedanta tradition.


  *   Oh OK, then his contribution to the Advaita through his works is NOT in traditional line, like Sri SSS, he also could be an â€˜asampradAyavAdiâ€™ in the eyes of some then.
