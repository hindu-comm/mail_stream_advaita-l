praNAms Hare Krishna

(a) sat = existence
(b) asat = non-existence
(c) satya = the unchanging one
(d) asatya = the changing one.

Further to the above, as per swamiji can we conclude : asatya jagat (the changing one)  is sat (the existing one) but NOT satya ( the unchanging one) ??  Likewise, sat (the existing one) is asatya (the changing one) but not asat ??  
With this the difference between sat and satya will be clarified.  asatya is sat but not satya and asat is neither sat nor satya nor asatya, asat is mithya like hare's horn.  Sri Sudhanshu prabhuji pls. clarify is this what Sri swamiji implied in his works??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!  
bhaskar
