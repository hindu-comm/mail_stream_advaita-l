Translation by Swami Gambhirananda  << If it be argued that although
reasoning is inconclusive, still it has to be done in a different way, ( so
as to avoid this defect), then even so there will be no getting away from
the defect >>.

 Bhashya –Initial part

<< इतश्च नागमगम्येऽर्थे केवलेन तर्केण प्रत्यवस्थातव्यम् ; यस्मान्निरागमाः
पुरुषोत्प्रेक्षामात्रनिबन्धनास्तर्का अप्रतिष्ठिता भवन्ति, उत्प्रेक्षाया

<<  For this further reason, one should not on the strength of mere logic
challenge something that has to be known from the Vedas. For reasoning,
that has no Vedic foundation and springs from the mere imagination of
persons, lacks conclusiveness >>.

Could be relevant.
