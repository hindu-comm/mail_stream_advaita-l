Asatya as mithya vastu is also ultimately Sat, Brahman, since it is
superimposed on that adhishThanam. So too the table. It is a case of
'baadhaayaam saamaanaadhikaranyam' as taught in the BGB brahmaarpanam
verse.

In the Taittiriya Bhashya I have cited, yes. But in specific contexts, they
may not be used as synonyms. We can say 'sad vidyaa leads to liberation.'
We can also say 'the knowledge of what is Satyam, that is Brahman, leads to
liberation.'
