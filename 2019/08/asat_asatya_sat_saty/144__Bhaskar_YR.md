I heard in one of the whatsapp groups  that Sri Paramananda bhArati mahAswaminiah (ofcourse based on shankara bhAshya) has differentiated the meaning of sat and satya and asat and asatya etc.  Would anyone let me know these differences in shankara bhAshya.

Thanks in advance.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
