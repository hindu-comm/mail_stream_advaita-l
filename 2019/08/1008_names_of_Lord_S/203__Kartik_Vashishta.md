OM NAMAH SIVANANDAYA

Revered Patrons,

Sadar Pranam,
Charan Sparsh,

This list and it's patrons continue to do what is for my best benefit. I
have no comparable "thank you" to offer. I am beholden to you all.

Please suggest a website or blog, etc. Which has the 1008 names of Lord
Shiva (sanskrit).

I am knowledgeable somewhat about Hindi script so I use that knowledge to
chant.

Thank YOU.

Sadar Pranam,
Charan Sparsh,
