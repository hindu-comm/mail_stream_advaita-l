A friend sent me this message:

It is unbelievable that in the era of globalization the affection towards
sanskrit stays alive . A Sanskrit scholar namely मारेल्ल कीर्तिचन्द्र who
is a disciple of late . उपद्रष्ट वेंकट कृष्णय्य ji of Vijayawada has
initiated  classes of अमरकोशः - गुरुबाल प्रबोधिका टीका सहितम्- A sloka per
day programme on whatsapp . Due to the interest of candidates its developed
for second group. And later due to the interest from Tamizh and kannada
people his अमरकोशः classes are translated into Tamiz and Kannada . For that
other groups are created for Kannada and Tamizh.  Nearly 500  people are
listening the Amarakosa by his efforts.  It's very proud to say that he
followed the lineage of his guru who was a committed sanskrit teacher and
taught several students for 60 years without taking a rupee. Mr. Keerti
chandra is basically a qualified Cost Accountant and his scholarship in
Sanskrit is also very good. It's happy to inform that he reached another
milestone by having his Amarakosa classes in website too. Wish that all the
Sanskrit scholars and  people welcome his efforts and pass this website
details to the students who are interested to learn Amarakosa.

Thank you.
