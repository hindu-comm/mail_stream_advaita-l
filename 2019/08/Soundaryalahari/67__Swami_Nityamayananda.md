Namaste,

I am reading a transcription of talk given on the Soundaryalahari by Kanchi
Paramarcharya. In that he mentions that there is a manuscript in the
library at Philadelphia in which paintings of Divine Mother is available
depicting each stanza.

Is this rare work available in a soft-copy at archive.org or in the
internet? Kindly share the link if it has one.

Yours in Bhagavan,
