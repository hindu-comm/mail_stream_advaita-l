It is probably a reference to the library of the University of 
Pennsylvania which is in Philadelphia and houses one of the biggest 
collections of Indian manuscripts in the West.  They were collected on 
behalf of one W. Norman Brown who was the Professor of Sanskrit there. 
Prof Brown published a critical edition and translation called "The 
Saundarya Lahari or Flood of Beauty" (Harvard Oriental Series vol. 43, 
Harvard University Press, Cambridge 1958)

There is a copy at archive.org:

Looking at it, there are some plates in the back reproducing some of the 
pages but it is not a full set.  The University of Pennsylvania has put 
scans of some of their manuscripts online 
(http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/sasia/skt-mss/) but the 
Saundarya Lahari manuscript does not appear to be one of them.
