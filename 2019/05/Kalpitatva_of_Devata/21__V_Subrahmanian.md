By the word 'mati bhedaat' Shankara conveys that each person takes one or
the other of the above to be the Supreme depending on his taste.

Adi Shankara's Harimide stotram, with commentary
Haritattvamuktavali by Svayamprakasha Yati

It is believed there is a tika by Anandagiri too for this work.


From the commentary to this verse it can be seen that 'Hari (Brahman) is 'sarva

devatAtmaka' - that is, all devata-s are within Brahman. The 'all' includes

the Vishnu enumerated by Shankara in the verse. By this Shankara is

stating the Turiya (Hari) who is the Supreme Brahman within whom Vishnu, etc.

devata-s obtain. The verse also means what I have said at the beginning

above.

Here is a significant statement of Shankara in the Brahmasutra bhashya

2.1.33: It should not be missed that the shruti delineating creation
is not of absolute reality; its

subject matter being the name-form vyavahara concocted by avidya. The real

purport of the creation shruti is to establish the Brahman-Atman realization.


 न चेयं परमार्थविषया सृष्टिश्रुतिः ; अविद्याकल्पितनामरूपव्यवहारगोचरत्वात् ,

ब्रह्मात्मभावप्रतिपादनपरत्वाच्च — इत्येतदपि नैव विस्मर्तव्यम् ॥ ३३ ॥……

That One Hari who is the destroyer of samsara, I bow to.]  Thus, when the names are parikalpita, it follows that the forms are also so.
