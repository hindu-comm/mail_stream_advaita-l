Dear Members, I fully agree with Jaladharji's view and we can't discuss all the things in the same scale. More over this in not at all entertainment forum. Sevaral silent reader are there & many people puts lot of efforts in bringing out truth of the actual works.People may have different opinions and personal attacks is not advisable whomsoever it may be

"This is "a _discussion group_ for Advaita Vedanta." Whenever you have a dialogue between two or more people there has to be some formal framework for the discussion otherwise they would just be shouting slogans at each other. The participants in the dialogue must be able to make sense of the 
discussions"
Yes,Moderators please take all measures who ever works outside this periphery for which I am not an exemption.
regardsKameswara

What "times" are we in now? Sanatana Dharma is Sanatana. It does not 
have an expiration date.

For what its worth Swami Shivananda was quite proud of being a descendent 
of Shri Appayya Dikshita and mentions this repeatedly in his writings.

The problem is more the kind of person who will e.g. do "Je-Je" to the 
murti of Shankaracharya on a day like this or to some other Guru and boast 
about him with flowery words but not internalize his teachings and put 
them into practice in his own life. The one who strives and struggles to 
understand and assimilate each word does not fall in that category and has 
every right to proclaim public pride in his intellectual heritage.
