Many of the things you have written are fine (which is why I continue to 
tolerate your presence here) but there is much else in "the genuine 
teaching of Vedanta as found in Sri Shankara's commentaries" which you 
omit. This will give a distorted picture of what Advaita Vedanta actually 
asks of us.
