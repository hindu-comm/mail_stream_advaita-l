Dear sir,

You are correct that Moksha is not a state or a realm to be attained. But,
it appears to be so so from a Vyavahara perspective. As long as we are in
the world and are bound by ignorance, the state of Moksha appears like a
goal (hence, considered Purushartha as well). I only mean in that sense.

Regards,
Nithin
