What "times" are we in now?  Sanatana Dharma is Sanatana.  It does not 
have an expiration date.

For what its worth Swami Shivananda was quite proud of being a descendent 
of Shri Appayya Dikshita and mentions this repeatedly in his writings.

The problem is more the kind of person who will e.g. do "Je-Je" to the 
murti of Shankaracharya on a day like this or to some other Guru and boast 
about him with flowery words but not internalize his teachings and put 
them into practice in his own life.  The one who strives and struggles to 
understand and assimilate each word does not fall in that category and has 
every right to proclaim public pride in his intellectual heritage.
