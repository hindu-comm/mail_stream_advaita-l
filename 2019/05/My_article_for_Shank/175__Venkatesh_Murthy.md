The Upanishad is saying Achaaryvaan Purusho Veda. You must learn Advaita
from Guru only. This Guru must be a Brahma Nishtha. If you don't tell your
Guru's name and background how can we say you have learnt from a proper
Guru? How do you know your Guru was correct in his teachings? Any body can
learn Upanishad Vakyas by heart and remember them. How is he a Brahma
Nishtha simply because he is speaking Upanishad Vakyas? Kindly answer all
these questions coming because we don't know your Guru.
