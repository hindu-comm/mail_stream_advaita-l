 Dear Sri Nitin Sridhar,
You write : " It is the attainment of such rare and 
most precious Moksha, which the Acharya puts 
forth as the phalashruti of this text."Is the word "attainment" correct? Where can one 
attain such rare and most precious Moksha?Has Moksha to be attained?
Is this what Sri Shankara means or it it what you mean?What is Moksha in Sri Shankara's own words?He says : nityatvAt mOkShasya sAdhakasvarUpAvyatirekAcca ||Kindly note the word "sAdhakasvarUpAvyatirekAcca".What does it mean?Does it mean it has to be attained newly?I fear your statement goes against the above teaching 
of Sri Shankara very much and is misleading the readers. 
Moksha is prAptasya prAptiH.
With respectful namaskars,
Sreenivasa Murthy

 Dear all,

Here is my article for Shankara Jayanthi-
http://www.indictoday.com/thoughts/the-garland-of-knowledge-a-glimpse-into-brahmajnanavalimala-of-adi-shankaracharya/

It is a short English commentary on the opening verse of the wonderful text
of Brahmajnanavalimala of Adi Shankaracharya.

Regards,
Nithin S
