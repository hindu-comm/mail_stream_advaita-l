Namaste Kameshwararaoji,

I've absolutely no idea now as to what you want in this thread; so I shall
stop with the following non-elaborate view.

Oh, please re-read my original statement and don't cut it wherever you
think its appropriate! I had said *I don't think* rebirth is possible
without sanchitakarma to which an ajnAni has a claim, thereby leading to
prArabdha. So, rest of your mail is out-of-context for me. I didn't argue
against rebirth at all!!

Best wishes for whatever it is that you consider your pursuit.
