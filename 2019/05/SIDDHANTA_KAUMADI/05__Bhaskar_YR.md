I got stuck on "Ganesha is derived". The question which bothers me is as follows - whether Ganesha is a vyavaharik satya like you and me, like this table and chair.. or whether He is a derived abstract concept.

>  We the advaitins not ready to accept and attribute even the vyAharArika satyatvaM to Lord Ganesha while happily accepting the vyAvahArika satyatva of even jada vastu-s like chairs and tables ðŸ˜Š   Ganesha, vishNu, shambhu, devi sUrya panchAyatana devata-s are mere derived abstract concepts ðŸ˜Š  thanks to nireeshwara Advaita vedAnta ðŸ˜Š  Kindly note I am not making this statement after seeing your doubt, I am stating this after seeing the confirmation that "Ganesha is mere derived abstract concept ".  Now the doubt is who wrote mahAbhArata ?? did vyAsa dictate this to mere abstract nonexistent entity called ganesha or the ganesha who wrote mahAbhArata is some other ganesha who has atleast vyAvahArika reality   ðŸ˜Š 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
