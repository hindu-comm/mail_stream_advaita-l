Dear Sir, It is more appropriate that you touches most of the times of my actual intention and definitely i am interested to study Laghusiddhantakaumadi.
He used the sutra 5468 in vedic derivations of omkar as pluta swara in the form of 3. This pluta swara is the rat on which ganesha rides. and formed the basis of invention of ganesh idle in different ways which i wanted to connect to the re-birth issues.

Then comming to my actual question and paraphrase here:Once you mentioned to me there is no use/purpose in knowing the prarabda which I fully agree that but one can able to know his previous birth by practically realizing his samskaras.Kathaupanishad (1.1.20): " Asteeti Eke Nayamasteeti Chaike"
For this Lord Yama himself persuades Nachiketa not to answer this question by taking instead of many other benefits. It was narrated in the First balli of the kathaupanishad and mentions that it can only be realized after obtaining 'Brahma Vidya' and practises through yogic discipline. 

Yogadarshna (3-18): " Samskara Sakshat Karnat Poorvajatignyanam"
It clearly mentioned one can able to know his previous birth by realizing his samskaras. Some times for re-birth issues , logics will not help, it only helps in arriving the conclusions. 
Katha (2-9): " Naisha Tarkena Matirapaneya" & Geeta talks about 'Vasansi Jeernani yatha Vihaya'
Other religions don't accept the concept of rebirth due to the absence of yoga/spritulaity. Jains, Buddhists who do not follow accepts the re-brith.
Sir, Pls explain what is causing or making the re-birth of the physical body irrespective of the prabrada. How do you interpret this although it is an abstacle for moksham. Simply it is the divine will or any purpose of its existence?. 

Sri Guru Padaravindarpana MastuKameswara

I may not be correct as you said but swamiji quoted this as a reference in his book on 'lekha sangraha'. As you said he menioned Panini sutra no. 5468 in the chapter ganesha vigyana to know how ganesha was derived and rebirth arises.

Swamijimay have possible quoted the Panini sutra 5.4.68 in some context of some word while mentioning some words related to Ganesha, but w.r.t. the word Ganesha itself, I am unable to see. Even so, in most pAThas 5.4.68 is समासान्ताः which is an अधिकारसूत्र so maybe he meant some sutra in that section is applicable to derive the word. The word Ganesha is a simple षष्ठीतत्पुरुष that doesn't take any समासान्त प्रत्यय from the 5.4.68 अधिकार। In any case, I would be interested if you can provide further references as to the wordings used preferable with the sutra itself. Further, if the mention of 5.4.68 was w.r.t. to Ganeshavijnana, that seems like some chapter in some tantra work, definitely not Paninian.

Before that he wrote a chapter on 'Re-birth' in which he mentioned various things and quoted siddhanta kaumadi has its reference. 
As Jaldharji said, it is utmost unlikely that the work is Siddhantakaumudi. There may be some translator and other language commentator such as Pt. Bhimasena (Bhaimi) who may have used some additional examples under some sutra, which also would be far-fetched as far as I have seen, even so as a footnote!
However, I am keen to study 'siddhanta kaumadi' in detail, pls suggest any books for its interpretation.

Based on your references to Siddhantakaumudi (SK) here, I doubt that you would be interested to study the same. Pls step through a few sutras clicking next (>) on top-right *not* top-left for SK sequence startinghttp://ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/sk1and see if it really interests you. Panini sutras in whichever order you study are padashAstra in that they help you derive साधु words. If your expectation is the same, then you may want to study Laghusiddhantakaumudi (LSK) before SK. If interested, do let me know and I shall link you to some LSK classes.
Kind rgds,
