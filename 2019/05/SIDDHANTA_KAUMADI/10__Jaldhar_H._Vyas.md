Are you sure?  The Siddhanta Kaumudi I know is on vyakarana (Sanskrit 
grammar.)  It is a rearrangement of Paninis' Sutras by Bhattoji Dikshita.
His disciple Varadaraja Bhatta abridged the S.K. into Madhyama, Laghu, and 
Sara Siddhanta Kaumudis the middle of which is the standard introduction 
to Vyakarana amongst Pandits.  I have learned it too.

Bhattoji Dikshita himself wrote a commentary called Praudha Manorama and 
Bala Manorama, Tattvabodhini etc. are also well known.  But I don't think 
you will find much adhyatmik content there.  You must be thinking of 
another book with a similar title.  Perhaps Siddhanta Bindu by Swami 
Madhusudana Saraswati which is an elaborate commentary on Shankaracharyas 
Dashashloki?
