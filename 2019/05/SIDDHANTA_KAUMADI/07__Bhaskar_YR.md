what is your view regarding vyavaharik satyatva of Ganesha, Shesha-Shayi Vishnu and also Ksheera Sagara. These are some hard questions in my opinion. Much harder than the logics of advaita.

When there is an ample provision in Advaita  for dhyAna, upAsana, archirAdi mArga krama mukti, different phala for different types of upAsya devata-s, upAsya devata sAkshAtkAra by doing the upAsana dhyAna etc.  like taila dhAravat.  How can we say upAsya devata-s / saguNa brahma / sOpAdhika brahma / kArya brahma etc. mere abstract or kalpita entities??  Yes, there is sAkshAtkAra of upAsya devata for the sincere upAsaka, he get the krama mukti.  vyAvahArika satya cannot be a satya or ‘indriya vedya’ if this type of satya does not have the pAramArthika satya as its essence.  Na hi nirAtmakaM kinchit bhUtaM vyavahArAya avakalpate.  Hence the stone is stone for everyone (unless one is specially privileged ), behind this sAmAnya jnana of that padArtha is because  of parabrahman as it’s upAdAna.  If not, then whole sAdhana types like bhakti, upAsana, dhyAna and resultant Ishwarya, gati, karma vruddhi will go for a six, divine visions that noble souls like paramahaMsa, tukaaraam, rAghavendra, prahlAda, Dhruva etc. had will become mere hallucination due to their eccentricity towards their Ishta devata / ArAdhya devata.  I am sorry to say this type of nireeshwara vAda would not do any good to Advaita vedAnta which has the theism as its foundation.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
