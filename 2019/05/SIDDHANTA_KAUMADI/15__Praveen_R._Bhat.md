Good to know. You can try to catch up with the uploaded classes on
https://www.youtube.com/user/bhatpraveenyt and if it interests you and find
them useful, let me know off the list and I shall provide you a link to
further classes or live classes as the case may be. (Pls ask for the
archive link as a right, but only after following all the classes).

I am not sure when I said this but it does sound like something similar I
would say! However, I would say the same thing about punarjanma.

I don't think rebirth is possible without sanchitakarma to which an ajnAni
has a claim, thereby leading to prArabdha. I don't consider divine will as
separate from samaShTi prArabdha, else Ishvara would be misunderstood as
biased with his own free will. To me, Ishvara is karmaphaladAta and His
sRShTi is for jIvabhoga in keeping with their karma. The entire loka is
manifest as per the karma of all jIvas put together at any point of time.
Just in case there is an objection to multiple jIvas: in DSV, the way a
jIva sees other jIvas and the world. lokyate anubhUyate iti lokaH.
