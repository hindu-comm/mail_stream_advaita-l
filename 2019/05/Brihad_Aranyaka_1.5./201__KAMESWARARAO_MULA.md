Dear Sir,
        'Sunrise and sunset are said with respect to earth and are to be understood in a secondary sense'
Since You raised such a important topic, some time back i collected some information regarding this:
The pratyaksha karma sakshi is the sun god i.e Suyanarayyana, master of the veda's who never say that i am this much and without me nothing happens. He remains witnessing the karma's of all the people. He never said that he know the veda dharma. Just by seeing the people's actions , he remains the same which never changes.
Arunam has a lot to talk on this thread, who ever recites arunam as a practise should show some light on this (Bhaskar Ji)
Every upasana has its beauty and i saw few people who realised themselves not even changed an inch since last 40 years by only doing Aurnopasana.
Ushas i.e Dawn is portrayed as warding off evil spirits of the night, and as a beautifullyadorned young woman riding in a golden chariot on her path across the sky. Dueto her color she is often identified with the reddish cows, and both arereleased by Indra from the Vala cave at the beginning of time. She is thedaughter of the heaven and British says her original name was Rani.
Sri Aurobindo in his Secret of the Veda, described Ushas as"the medium of the awakening", the activity and the growth of the othergods. she helps in Vedic realisation. By her increasingillumination the whole nature of man is clarified, through her people arrives at the Truth.
She is worshipped as the goddess as 'Chhathi mayya' in the states of UP, Bihar & nepal during the Chhath puja.

 Hari Om,

It is a well-known rule that if there is a prima facie contradiction
between Shruti and pratyaksha, then it is to be inferred that Shruti
intends to say something else.

In this connection, I was struggling with the intended meaning of Brihad
Aranyak Shruti 1.5.23. It states that sun goes to VAyu in evening during
sunset. In Adhyatma, the chakShu (counterpart of sun) goes to PrAna
(counterpart of VAyu).

The topic is for upAsanA of PrAna.

However, the merger of chakShu in PrAna is an empirical fact whereas merger
of sun in VAyu is not an objective fact. Nothing happens to sun in evening.
It remains where it is and where it was. Sunrise and sunset are said with
respect to earth and are to be understood in a secondary sense.

How to resolve this contradiction?

If we were to say that it is an adhidaivata sun which is talked about, then
is it true that Surya merges with Vayu devata in *evening *and during *sunset?
*This should not be so for He is available for other people of same earth.

If it is neither physical sun which merges in VAyu nor Surya devatA, then
how exactly should we understand the reference of merger of sun in vAyu in
evening during sunset.

If we were to hold that the statement can make sense for the purposes of
upAsana, then my question is whether we can do the upAsana with a factually
wrong statement. Will we get requisite shraddhA. The upAsanA should also be
logical. For e.g. in Brahma Sutra BhAShya, BhagvAn BhAShyakAra says that
there is nothing illogical in worshipping omnipresent at a particular
localized place but the vice versa cannot be proper. अत्रोच्यते — नायंदोषः
न तावत्परिच्छिन्नदेशस्य सर्वगतत्वव्यपदेशःकथमप्युपपद्यते सर्वगतस्य तु
सर्वदेशेषुविद्यमानत्वात्परिच्छिन्नदेशव्यपदेशोऽपि कयाचिदपेक्षया सम्भवति.
(1.2.7)

Thus, it appears that upAsanA cannot be recommended by way of factually
wrong statement. It can be, however, recommended through statements having
figurative usage.

In this regard, please share your views on 1.5.23.

Regards,
Sudhanshu.
