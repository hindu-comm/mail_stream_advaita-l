Namaste Sudhanshu ji,

In this context, Sureshvaracharya has an interesting interpretation to
offer in the vArttika (verse 380) -

आत्मैव प्राणशब्द: स्यात्प्राणबन्धनवाक्यत: |
असदेवेदमित्युक्तेरात्मनो भानुसंभव: ||

>From the ChAndogya mantra (6.8.2) प्राणबन्धनं हि सोम्य मन, it follows that
the word prANa in this context refers to the Atma, and from the ChAndogya
mantra (3.19.1) (असदेवेदमग्र आसीत् तत्सदासीत्तत्समभवत्तदाण्डं निरवर्तत), it
follows that the rise of the sun is from (and by implication, the setting
of the sun is into) the self.

Anandagiri AchArya clarifies that it is the unrealised Atma (ajnAta Atma)
that is being referred to here by prANa. In his shAstra prakAshikA TikA to
the vArttika, he comments thus: अज्ञातस्यऽऽत्मनोऽत्र प्राणशब्दत्वे
नियामकमाह - प्राणेति |

So the rising and setting of the sun can be understood to mean the creation
and dissolution of the sun from the Atma - as opposed to the daily rising
and setting of the sun, which could lead to a doubt like the one that you
have raised.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
