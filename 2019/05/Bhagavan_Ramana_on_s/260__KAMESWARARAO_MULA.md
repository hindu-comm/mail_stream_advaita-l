The mysterious guidance by a black dog which you mentioned so nicely may be the vehicle of that guru for which circumabulation of arunachalagiri is performed.So it has has shown its light as a torch which is the form of 'Guru' and might have went away to reach his master's lotus feet after its job is over.

 Made my day today.....excellent !

Bhagavan is the greatest advaitin & saint of modern era....

Even now, the Arunachala mountain reverberates with the words of Bhagavan...My brother's colleague who was an 
atheist thought of going to Arunachala at the behest of his friend. Landed there at midnight and thought of 
performing giri pradakshina. At the dark hours of 2:00 AM, he lost the way but was mysteriously guided 
by a black dog that accompanied him till he completed the circumambulation and vanished in
darkness.....
