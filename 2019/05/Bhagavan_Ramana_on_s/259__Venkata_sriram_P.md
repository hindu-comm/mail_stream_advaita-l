Made my day today.....excellent !

Bhagavan is the greatest advaitin & saint of modern era....

Even now, the Arunachala mountain reverberates with the words of Bhagavan...My brother's colleague who was an 
atheist thought of going to Arunachala at the behest of his friend.  Landed there at midnight and thought of 
performing giri pradakshina.  At the dark hours of 2:00 AM, he lost the way but was mysteriously guided 
by a black dog that accompanied him till he completed the circumambulation  and vanished in
darkness.....

rgs,
sriram
