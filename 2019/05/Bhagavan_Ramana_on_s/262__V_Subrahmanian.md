Members of Thenkalai and Vadakalai sects come to blows on the road

Tension prevailed in Chinna Kanchipuram on Friday evening when members of
two Vaishnavite sects — Thenkalais and Vadakalais — clashed over the
chanting of *Naalayira Divya Prabhandam *to Lord Varadharaja Perumal, who
was taken out in a procession on the eighth day of the annual festival,
Thiruvedipuri Utsavam.
Heated argument

As per the ritual, the idol of saint Thirumangai Azhwar was taken thrice
around the presiding deity, which was mounted on a horse. The Thenkalai
sect devotees then began reciting the *Naalayira Divya Prabandham*, a
collection of 4,000 Tamil hymns, written and sung by the Azhwars in praise
of Lord Vishnu.

As per the ritual, the Thenkalai group started singing the hymns on the
Thirukatchi Nambi Street, but members of the Vadakalai sect opposed them.
Soon, they got into a heated argument and some of them thrashed each other
in the middle of the road.

The Thenkalai group lodged a complaint at the Vishnukanchi police station,
alleging that a few Vadakalai sect members pushed them down.

This deprived them of their traditional right of reciting the *Prabandham*,
the complaint added.
