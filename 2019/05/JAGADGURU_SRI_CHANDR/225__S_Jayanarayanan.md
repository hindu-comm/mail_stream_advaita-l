Formal Sannyasa

The shock of having lost the physical presence
of the guru, and the tearful farewell of his loving
parents must have weighed heavily on
Narasimha’s mind. The physical vaccum was
hard to bear, even though the strong mental
bonds made it somewhat bearable.

On the day before coronation, he was in
constant prayer of his guru who responded to
his prayers. His guru appeared in his dream and
imparted the Mahavakya of the Peetha, Aham
Brahmasmi (I am Brahman). Though he was
blessed by his guru himself, he felt duty bound
to go through the formalities and demonstrate
the importance of keeping up the time honoured
traditions of receiving the Mahavakya initiation
formally.

Worship of Sri Chakra is a must for the
swamis of the Peetha. Normally, the Sri Vidya
mantropadesa would be done by the guru. Since
Sri Narasimha Bharati had passed away, the
mantropadesa was done by Srikanta Sastri who
had been initiated into it by the Mahaswami.

On the ninth day of Chaitra Bahula of Sri
Paridhavi Samvatsara, April 7, 1912, a new
chapter dawned in the history of Sharada Peetha.
Narasimha performed the required rites to
become a sannyasi. After having another bath in
the Tunga, Narasimha stood navel deep in the
water and took the vow of non-injury. He was
ready to receive his formal initiation into
sannyasa from Sri Satyananda Saraswati
Mahaswami with the mahavakya, Aham
Brahmasmi.

He received the safforn robes, the sacred staff
and the kamandalu (water-pot) from Sri
Satyananda Mahaswami. As desired by the
previous Acharya, he was given the sannyasi
name Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati.

The brilliance of inner life showed itself in
the extraordinary beauty of the face, and a
magnetic power to draw everyone towards him.

As for the title Bharati, it was indeed most
appropriate. He had mastered the Tarka Sastra
and most of Mimamsa and Vedanta. His mind
was sharp as a kusa grass, and could grasp the
true import of Sastraic statements. Had not the
prayers of his predecessor to Sharadamba that
Narasimha should become a ‘sarvajna’ borne
fruit?

The new Mahaswami then proceeded to the
adhistanam, the samadhi shrine of his guru. There
he beheld the divine form of his guru as if he
were physically present there. Bubbling with joy
he composed a poem extolling the glory of his
guru, extracts from which read:
“You are the incarnation of Lord Siva. As if
to confirm this you have been named Sivaswami.
Will not your compassionate glance fall on me
and make me also worthy of this glorious
Peetham? You have immensely graced me by
your sagacious guidance and blessings at the Kala
Bhairava temple... Please accept me as a bee
seeking your lotus feet.”

When Mahaswami was engrossed in the
worship of Sharada, the doors of the sanctum
sanctorum closed. The Mahaswami could feel the
hand of Sharada over his head and her sweet
voice blessed him. There could not have been a
more auspicious augury for his spiritual
stewardship.
