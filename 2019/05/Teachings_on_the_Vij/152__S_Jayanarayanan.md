Periyakulam: JUNE 3-4, 2012

Sri Adi Shankaracharya’s Teachings Are Relevant Even Today

Jagadguru Shankaracharya Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji arrived at Periyakulam on the evening of June 3
and was given a grand welcome at the Agrahara. The Jagadguru was then led to the Pravachana Mandiram,
Sringeri Shankara Math amidst Vedic chants and the singing of Bhajans led by Udayalur Sri Kalyanarama Bhagavathar.

After the Dhuli Pada Puja was performed, Swagata Patrikas were read in Sanskrit and Tamil. Two elderly
Vedic Pandits of Periyakulam, Brahmasri V. Thyagaraja Deekshitar and Brahmasri Dr. P K Rajagopala Bhattacharyar,
each aged around 100 years received the Jagadguru’s blessings and were felicitated on the occasion with shawls
and cash awards. Financial assistance was also provided to S P R Pandian nursery and primary school in Periyakulam
and to an orphanage located in Theni. Justice Sri V. Ramasubramanian, Jugde of the Chennai High Court spoke on
the occasion about the Peetham and his experiences with the Jagadguru. 

The Jagadguru began His Anugraha Bhashanam speaking about the greatness of the incarnation of Sri Adi Shankaracharya.
It is our fortune that we have Him as our Guru. He did not stop with writing His Bhashyas on the Prasthana Traya.
As they were comprehensible only by the sharpest of intellects, He penned a number of Prakarana Granthas and Stotras.
He integrated a number of teachings.

There are many who question if the teachings of Sri Adi Shankaracharya apply to the 21st century. His teachings
are so universal that they apply for all time. For instance, Sri Adi Shankaracharya wrote Prashnottara Ratnamalika,
a series of questions and answers conveying deep philosophical truths. For instance, Sri Adi Shankaracharya raises
the question – what is most difficult for man to attain.

Man has to first ponder over how his wealth can be utilized. How can wealth be distributed. Usually man spends
wealth in worthless pursuits. Only wealth distributed to the appropriate person at the appropriate place and
appropriate time deserves praise. Bhagavan says in the Gita – 

दातव्यमिति यद्दानं दीयतेऽनुपकारिणे ।
देशे काले च पात्रे च तद्दानं सात्त्विकं स्मृतम् ॥

A person who has studied the Vedas or the Shastras, one who has good Achara, one who is poor – all of these people
are appropriate for charity. The place could be a holy town as Kashi or Rameswaram while the time best suited for
charity could be a Parva kala or Punya Kala such as Grahanam, Ardhodaya Punyakala or Mahodaya Punyakala. That is
why Adi Shankaracharya states that the first rare quality is वित्तं त्यागसमेतम् – wealth that is meant for charity. Hence
when a situation suited for charity comes, do not think of your budget limits and for you may not get such an
opportunity again. 

There are also a class of people who engage in charity but insult the person receiving the charity. Such charity
is useless. Today, there are people who go to the extent of insulting even Vaidikas when engaging in charity.
Whatever one gives in charity, give it with a pleasant and affectionate attitude. This is why Sri Adi Shankaracharya
states the second rare quality – दानं प्रियवाक्सहितम्.

While there are many who are qualified and learned, few have the humility to go with their learning. If we look
at our ancestors, we see humility at its best. It can be said that Kalidasa is such a poet who is unparalleled
not merely in India but in the entire world. The Jagadguru then mentioned a shloka to talk of Kalidasa’s greatness – 

पुरा कवीनां गणनाप्रसङ्गे कनिष्ठिकाधिष्ठितकालिदासः ।
अद्यापि तत्तुल्यकवेरभावात् अनामिका सार्थवती बभूव ॥

Once, when asked to mention the names of poets, the first name counted with the little finger (Kanishtika) was
Kalidasa. However there was no second poet to name with the ring finger (such was Kalidasa’s greatness). Hence
the name given to the ring finger in Sanskrit, “Anaamika” (that which cannot be named) is appropriate even to
this day. 

Such being his greatness, Kalidasa writes at the start of his Raghuvamsha Mahakavyam – 

क्व सूर्यप्रभवो वंशः क्व चाल्पविषया मतिः ।
तितीर्षुर्दुस्तरं मोहादुडुपेनास्मि सागरम् ॥

Where is the greatness of the Raghuvamsha that descends from Surya and where is my puny intellect! Out of
delusion, I desire to cross the vast ocean with a small boat (by attempting to describe the ancestors of Sri Rama).

Thus, despite his inimitable poetic skill, Kalidasa was so humble. We have to remember that how much ever we learn,
there is always a lot more to learn. There is a story mentioned in the Vedas that Bharadwaja spent three lifetimes
studying the Vedas and yet could not finish the study. Indra appeared at the end of his third lifetime and asked
Bharadwaja what he would do if he were to get another life. Bharadwaja determinedly said that he will complete
the study of the Vedas. Indra then pointed three mountains representing all Vedic knowledge and said to Bharadwaja
that his knowledge acquired over three lifetimes was merely equivalent to three fistfuls of sand taken from the
three mountains – वेदा वा एते । अनन्ता वै वेदाः । एतद्वा एतैस्त्रिभिरायुर्भिरन्ववोचथाः। अथ तम् इतरदननूक्तमेव।

The extent of the Vedas goes beyond all limits. Hence one must cultivate humilty. If humility is absent,
all learning is futile. Greater the learning, greater must be the absence of pride. Hence Sri Bhagavatpada
describes the third rare quality as ज्ञानम् अगर्वम् – Learning without pride. One must realize that only the Lord
is omniscient – सर्वज्ञः.

The fourth quality that Sri Adi Shankaracharya describes as rare is क्षमान्वितं शौर्यम् – Power must be tinged with patience.
One must realize that there is no who is faultness – न कश्चिन्नापराध्यते । It is not uncommon to see people commit a mistake
and when questioned, the reply would be “Does not everyone commit mistakes? Why do you get unduly angry with me?”
However the same person would be intolerant when he sees another committing a mistake. Hence one must realize that
everyone is prone to mistakes and cultivate tolerance, even if he is endowed with power. 

Thus has Sri Adi Shankaracharya pointed out to us that these four qualities – wealth along with the disposition
to engage in sacrifice, charity given with pleasing words, learning with humility, power coupled with patience
and tolerance – are rare and must be cultivated.

People who question the relevance of Sri Adi Shankaracharya’s teachings must ask themselves, “Is there anyone for
which these qualities are undesirable? Can anyone say that Sri Adi Shankaracharya’s instruction to cultivate
these qualities is irrelevant in the present times?” Hence it is completely inappropriate to think that
Sri Adi Shankaracharya wrote His works with only a few people in mind. He has in fact taken efforts to point out
the way to attaining Shreyas for every man in the world. It is only because of this that we adore
Sri Adi Shankaracharya on Shankara Jayanti with the same fervour as we observe Rama Navami and Krishna Jayanti.

The Jagadguru remembered His Guru’s Vijayams and His earlier Vijayams to Periyakulam (in 1980, 1981, 1987 and 1995)
and said that the Guru-Shishya relationship between the Acharyas of Sringeri and the residents of Periyakulam
stretches over many generations. 

On 4th June, the Jagadguru gave Darshan at the Pravachana Mandiram, Sringeri Shankara Math. Devotees performed
Bhiksha Vandanam and Pada Puja and received the Jagadguru’s blessings.
