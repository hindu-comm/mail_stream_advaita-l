The 33rd Jagadguru Shankaracharya of Sringeri, Sri Sacchidananda
Shivabhinava Nrsimha Bharati Swamigal, was as great as Sri Adi
Shankaracharya Himself. He is also considered as an avatara of
Bhagavatpada. The Acharya initiated the search for the birthplace of
Bhagavatpada, and eventually constructed a temple in Kalati hosting the
shrines of the murtis of Bhagavatpada and also his mother Aryamba.

Sri Kalati Kshetra Stotram is a two-verse hymn in glorification of the
birthplaceof Bhagavatpada written by him. Many Stotras have written by Adi
Shankaracharya on many deities. But only one kshetram has been glorified by
Him in a separate stotra and that is Kashi-kshetram. The 33rd Jagadguru
Shankaracharya of Sringeri has also written many Stotras like Adi
Shankaracharya on many deities. But only one kshetram has been glorified by
Him in a separate stotra and that is Kalati-kshetram.
