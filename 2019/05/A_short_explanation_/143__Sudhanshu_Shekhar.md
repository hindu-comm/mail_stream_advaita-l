Bhakar ji,

sAkShI needs something other than itself of which it can be a sAkShI. What
is there which is non-Brahman of which Brahman can be a sAkShI? So Brahman
can never be sAkShI. But that which is sAkShI i.e. kshetrajna/pratyagAtmA
is not different from Brahman. Brahman is the swaroopa of sAkShI.

If you impute sAkShitva to Brahman, then the anantatva of Brahman will be
contradicted.

Sudhanshu.
