Hari Om Bhaskar ji,

Basically he is saying the following :-

(1) SAkShAtkAra is vritti-rUpa.Vritti is within manas. (actually a specific
shape of manas)

(2) For sAkShAtkAra, a sAkShI is required which will be the sAkShi of that
sAkShAtkAra-vrittI. Hence, it is not possible in swarUpa.

(3) SAkShAtkAra-vrittI, akhandAkAra-vrittI, AtmAkAra-vrittI are same. (He
did not say this explicitly. It is inferred).

(4) In GItA bhAShya, while explaining the AtmAkAra-vrittI, BhAShyakAra says
- when manas is atyanta nirmala (actually two more conditions of atyanta
svachcha and atyanta sUkShma are there), then owing to the commonness of
the feature of atyanta-nirmalatva, AtmAkAra-vrittI is possible (even if
Atman is nirAkAra).

(5) Since Atman is not a viShaya - sAkShAtkAra-vrittI refers to a vritti
which does refer to *any* viShaya.

Regrads.
Sudhanshu.
