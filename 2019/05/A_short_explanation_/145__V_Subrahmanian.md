Dear Sudhamshu ji,

Thanks for summarizing the message of Sastrinah. One more important point
that he has said, at 3.13 is:

'anya aviShayatvam', that is, that vritti has no other, anAtma, object for
its vishaya.  In effect, if the manas is devoid of any other object, then
it is AtmAkAra.

This is from the video.

I relate the Gita verse 6.25:

आत्मसंस्थं मनः कृत्वा *न किञ्चिदपि चिन्तयेत्* ॥ २५ ॥   where the Bhashya
says:

आत्मसंस्थम् आत्मनि संस्थितम् ‘आत्मैव सर्वं *न ततोऽन्यत् किञ्चिदस्ति*’
इत्येवमात्मसंस्थं मनः कृत्वा न किञ्चिदपि चिन्तयेत् ।

This part corresponds to what Sastrinah has said that I cited.

regards
subrahmanian.v
