(1) SAkShAtkAra is vritti-rUpa.Vritti is within manas. (actually a specific shape of manas)

(2) For sAkShAtkAra, a sAkShI is required which will be the sAkShi of that sAkShAtkAra-vrittI. Hence, it is not possible in swarUpa.

(3) SAkShAtkAra-vrittI, akhandAkAra-vrittI, AtmAkAra-vrittI are same. (He did not say this explicitly. It is inferred).

(4) In GItA bhAShya, while explaining the AtmAkAra-vrittI, BhAShyakAra says - when manas is atyanta nirmala (actually two more conditions of atyanta svachcha and atyanta sUkShma are there), then owing to the commonness of the feature of atyanta-nirmalatva, AtmAkAra-vrittI is possible (even if Atman is nirAkAra).

(5) Since Atman is not a viShaya - sAkShAtkAra-vrittI refers to a vritti which does refer to *any* viShaya.

Thanks for taking time to share.  With regard to No. 2, does it mean there is sAkshi which is witnessing the manas which has acquired sAkshAtkAra ??  has he elaborated this point??  And No. 5, the last statement : “sAkShAtkAra-vrittI refers to a vritti which does refer to *any* viShaya” needs little more elaboration.

Kindly  look into it in your leisure time.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
