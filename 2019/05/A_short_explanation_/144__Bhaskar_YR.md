Hare Krishna

sAkShI needs something other than itself of which it can be a sAkShI. What is there which is non-Brahman of which Brahman can be a sAkShI? So Brahman can never be sAkShI. But that which is sAkShI i.e. kshetrajna/pratyagAtmA is not different from Brahman. Brahman is the swaroopa of sAkShI.

If you impute sAkShitva to Brahman, then the anantatva of Brahman will be contradicted.


Ã˜     If the sarvavyApakatvaM of Atman emphasized then there was no need to say kshetrajna svarUpa is NOT sAkshi but brahman as brahman is sAkshi (the witness) and witnessing object as well.  ( ahamannaM, annAda, shlOkakarta).  As we know there is nothing apart from THAT :  nAnyOtOsti drashtA, nAnyOtOsti shrOtA, nAnyOtOsti manta and vijnAtA.  And this brahman is what explained as stree, puM, kumAra, kumAri and finally jAtO bhavasi vishvatOmukhaHâ€¦And same up. Subsequently says he is sAkshi cheetah, karmAdhyaksha, karma phala dAta, sarva bhUtAntarAtma and finally kevalO nirguNascha.  In that sense all labels pertain to brahman only ðŸ˜Š

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
