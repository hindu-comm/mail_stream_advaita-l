The swarUpa of kshetrajna is not sAkshi. SwarUpa of kshetrajna is Brahman.

Very interesting.  So that brahman  which has been described in shvetAshvatara as sAkshi cheetah, sarva bhUtAntarAtma, kevala nirguNa  is not the svarUpa of kshetrajna. Please explain in detail.  In short are you trying to say sAkshi is not brahman and kshetrajna svarUpa in brahman and not sAkshi??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
