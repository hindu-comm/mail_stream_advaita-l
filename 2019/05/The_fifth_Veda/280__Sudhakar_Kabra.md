Respected learned members,
It is said that itihas and puranas are considered by some as fifth veda.Reference is given as Chandogya Upanishad 7.1.2Speakers of Mahabharata and Ramayana also emphasise it as fifth veda.

Queries are:

1. Does anywhere in itihas / puranas it is specifically mentioned as fifth veda?

2.Vedas are considered to be aporusheya (Having no writer but heard by Rishis during their meditation)but compiled by Vedavyasa at a later date for human understanding.
Do avaita siddhanta give any explanation for this?

Can any learned member throw some light or give their opinion on this.
Thanks and regards
Sudhakar kabra
