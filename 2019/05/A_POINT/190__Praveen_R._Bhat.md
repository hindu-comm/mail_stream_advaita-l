I may also be pardoned for what I am about to say... Respected Sir, isn't
it easy for you to not even name your Revered Guru while quoting his
teaching every time and in the same breath name the entire lineage of Gurus
by calling their teachings as "so-called traditional"?! Should others'
Gurus be any less Revered, at least for their shiShyAs if not you?! Against
them, you think it proper to quote some new-age asampradAyavit assuming him
to be a jnAnI or whatever your respect towards such a person is. How proper
is it? I, for one, am completely in disagreement with these arm-chair
philosophers.

Moreover, those who may have completed their journey, so-to-say, need not
sit in judgement of every mail and article quoted on the list. If you can't
contribute to their jnAna at least let others try to come out of their
ajnAna following the same tradition that hopefully some of the Revered
Gurus of yore followed. Else, they won't be revered at all as
asampradAyavit mUrkhavadupekShaNIyaH said the same bhAShya you so choose to
pick your quotes from.

Thankfully, neither did the compassionate Shruti or the tradition take the
highest stand and parrot from the pAramArthika, but came down to the level
of the seeker, as there is so much variety there, and held their hand to
walk them to the highest. Glorious is the tradition and may it see the
respect it deserves from ajnAnIs and jnAnIs alike!
