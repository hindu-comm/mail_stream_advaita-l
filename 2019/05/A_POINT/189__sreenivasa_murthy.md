Dear friends, Here is an excerpt which clearly reflects the 
present condition prevailing in the so called traditional teachingof Advaita Vedanta.This is my personal observation who has studiedVedanta at the feet of my Revered Guru whobased his teaching on Sri Shankara's commentaries.Quote:
Systems are definitely not what this is about. Manythink it is. What it is about is the direct and non-conceptual comprehension ofyour real nature. 



Intellectuals often try to integrate andsystematize the “teachings” into some type of coherent system to satisfy theconceptual mind. Of course, this activity is very far from the intention of thepointers. The various systems and their interminable conflicts are the resultof this activity. The discussion about, and attempted resolution of, theseintellectually created conflicts is generally what is termed “philosophy”.Non-dual traditions also end up (in some circles) spawning this philosophicalactivity.
 [John Wheeler]
Unquote.I have posted this posting seeing the type of subject 
matters and the discussions that are going on at present.
I completely agree with the above statementsof Sri John Wheeler.

I may please be pardoned.With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
