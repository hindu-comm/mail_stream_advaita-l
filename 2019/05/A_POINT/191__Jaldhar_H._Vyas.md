Having just completed the celebration of Shankara Jayanti, reading this 
leaves a bad taste in the mouth.  A guru is to be judged by the quality of 
his disciples so it is probably for the best you don't mention his name 
because you bring disrepute to him every time you post this kind of 
nonsense which unfortunately has been many times over the years.

The basic fact which you do not seem to grasp even though it has been 
explained to you many time is that Advaita Vedanta is a practical method 
for the kalyana of all beings at all levels.  Certainly some mahatmas have 
reached the point where there is no need for systems.  If you are one of 
them by all means repair to the Himalayas.  But this is "a _discussion 
group_ for Advaita Vedanta."  Whenever you have a dialogue between two or 
more people there has to be some formal framework for the discussion 
otherwise they would just be shouting slogans at each other.  The 
participants in the dialogue must be able to make sense of the 
discussions and the evidence presented therein.  This is the systematic 
aspect of Advaita Vedanta and far from being some kind of aberration is 
one of its pillars: shravana, _manana_, and nidhidhyasana.  You say your 
guru bases his teaching on Shankaracharyas bhashyas?  Ask him to describe 
their contents to you.  You may be surprised as to how much systemizing is 
going on.
