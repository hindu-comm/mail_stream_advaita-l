I think this is more a question of how comfortable the teacher-student
interaction is. You just have to make sure that the teacher is able to
correct mistakes and you are able to follow. Personally I feel that it
requires a certain level of prior understanding of Vedic chanting to use
Skype effectively. I have seen some pundits very reluctant or refuse to
teach over the Skype, while others are fine with it.
