In Apastambha upanayanam the vatu has to say shraddha cha me ashraddhaa cha me, smrutam cha me asmrutanchame, satya cha me anrutaM chame etc.  tanma ubhayaM vrataM.  What does this mean can anyone explain me in the upanayana context without giving mere meaning of the statement.   

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

I know this family personally.  Father is Arun and mother is Lakshmi.  And I donâ€™t think its their contribution.  Father Arun is the elder brother of Magadi Lakshminarayana shastri's daughter-in-law Veena.  This kid most of the time spend its time at Shastry's house.  Perhaps that would be the reason this kid learnt the shloka and birudaavali.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

What all can a child be taught? Here is a wonderful example for this. A small boy, in his Upanayanam ceremony,recites shlokas on the Acharyas and a short text that is called the 'Sringeri Birudavali.' The event brings a lot of things to the fore, the role of parents, others, the things they value and want to pass on to the next generation. I have no idea about the details of the family featured in this short video. My humble pranams to all those involved in this.
