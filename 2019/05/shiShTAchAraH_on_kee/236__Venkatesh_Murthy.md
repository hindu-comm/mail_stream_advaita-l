Namaste

I read somewhere Bharata's Natyashastra says Rishi's have both moustache
and beard. They were Gruhasthas and performed all Vedic activities like
Yajnas. Therefore there is no problem for a Brahmin to have moustache and
beard. But he should not shave moustache and have only beard. That is not
correct. It looks like Muslim custom. Another thing I have seen is if wife
is pregnant the husband will have a beard and not shave.
