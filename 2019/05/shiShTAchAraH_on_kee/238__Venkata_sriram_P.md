Yes...it seems so.  Few maharashtrian traditional scholars sport with shikha & moustache only.  No beard. They also wear typical cap like Nehru / Tilak etc.

Shri Devadatta Patil Ji looks similar to the above.

 I
 think it is mostly desha/sampradaya/kula achara also to
 sport moustache only, shave beard and also have shikha. Many
 Madhva scholars/vaidikas have this practice. In Maharashtra
 also this is the norm mostly among smarta-s
 too.
