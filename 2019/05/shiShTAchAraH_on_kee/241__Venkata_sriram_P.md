Nice to learn such diverse traditions across India among traditional brahmin families. 

Citing an example how diverse is the traditional customs :

In Godavari Delta of Andhra Pradesh, among konaseema dravidas (a sub-sect of brahmins), 
giving away of tray made of palm leaf by a sumangli to another sumangali is 'a-shubha'.  
A sumangali never takes the palm leaf tray from another lady because as per their custom, 
it should be given during death ceremonies / widows etc. It is ashubha in our family and 
my mother never takes palm leaf tray from another lady.

Whereas, in Rayalaseema region, a sumangali giving away palm leaf tray to another 
sumangali is considered 'shubha' (auspicious).  There is a vrata among them
where they give 108 trays to another sumangali.

rgs,
sriram

 It has to be so
 as I've heard some in the North don't shave their
 moustache as long as their parents are alive, equivalent to
 shikha elsewhere.
