Thank you Subbuji for sharing such a beautiful and sweet leelAs of Bhagavan !

My regret in life is that I couldn't see both Bhagavan & Kanchi Mahaperiyava when 
they were present in their physical bodies.  

Bhagavan's love knew no boundaries and shed His grace to all irrespective of
caste, creed, religion, animate & in-animate ....

Animals, creatures etc. that approached Bhagavan were great siddhAs 
who used to come to have Bhagavan's darshan in disguise.  

Namo Bhagavate Sriramanaya...

rgs,
sriram
