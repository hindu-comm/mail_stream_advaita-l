If this is uttered by the disciple in the sense 'तत्त्वम् असि त्वम्' (Thou
are the Truth) (not tat tvam asi) in the manner Arjuna said पितासि लोकस्य
चराचरस्य त्वमस्य पूज्यश्च गुरुर्गरीयान् । न त्वत्समोऽस्त्यभ्यधिकः कुतोऽन्यो
लोकत्रयेऽप्यप्रतिमप्रभाव ॥ ४३ ॥  in the 11th Chapter, then it would be a
genuine stuti addressed by the enlightened disciple in expression of his
gratitude to his Guru.
