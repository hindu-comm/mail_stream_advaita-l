Namaste Praveen ji
Yes I remember that joke of Pujya Swami Dayanandaji.

The Guru instructs the shishya 'tattvamasi'. Now the shishya understands
this teaching. And then if the shishya accidentally blurts out 'tattvamasi'
back at the Guru - the Guru can only shake his head - tsk tsk tsk - "hey
you don't have teach me, I am the Guru, so I know that already. So just own
up the knowledge yourself!" ...the shishya has to say "aham brahmAsmi" -
that's the idea...

Om
Raghav
