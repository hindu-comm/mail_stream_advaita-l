Dear mumukshu friends, 

When I started the Vedanta journey my Revered Gurugave me a very important instruction at the verycommencement of the journey . It was as follows:
"A person, desirous of studying the teachingsof a Sage 
pertaining to one's true svarUpa, must and should 
take the standpoint of the Sage at the time of 
 studying the teachings."
This made my journey a very comfortable one.With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
