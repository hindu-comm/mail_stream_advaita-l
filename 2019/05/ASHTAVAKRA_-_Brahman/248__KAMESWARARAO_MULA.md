Dear Members,             I found very interesting debate of Astavaka vs Acharya Bandi in the video from whose link is given below. It was very interesting to know the teachings and his arguments made regarding Brahman.

The Ashtavakra vs Acharya Bandi debate

महर्षि अष्टावक्र ने कैसे पराजित किया आचार्य बंदी को |

The episode shows the story of Ashtavakra, a very young sage, who goes to the court of King Janaka to re-educate the scholars of his court and eradicate a wrong tradition that was prevailing at that time, of killing scholars who would get defeated in debates. There, knowledge was not used for Universal Welfare.
The explanation of dialogues exchanged between Ashtavakra and Acharya Bandi during their debate can run into this video, for they convey the very subtle Truths of Indian Philosophy.
