The context of this discussion is the famous beginning of adhyAsa
bhAshya युष्मदस्मत्प्रत्ययगोचरयोर्विषयविषयिणो*स्तमःप्रकाशवद्विरुद्धस्वभावयो*
रितरेतरभावानुपपत्तौ सिद्धायाम् , तद्धर्माणामपिसुतरामितरेतरभावानुपपत्तिः।

The question is if light and darkness have viruddha svabhAva, is it the
mutual exclusion between the presence and absence of light or is it the
contrarian nature between two existent entities such as the snake and the
mongoose.
