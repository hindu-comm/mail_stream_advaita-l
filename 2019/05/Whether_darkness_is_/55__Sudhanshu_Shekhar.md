Hari Om Praveen ji,

Pl don't think of my question as any aropa on Bhagvan Vidyaranya though I
agree -- after your statement -- that it may prima facie have looked like
that.

In any case, my "switch" to pratyaksha is not for convenience sake. It is
to explain the untenability of interpretation of sarva-Aloka-abhAva as ~(A1
& A2... & An).

Regards,
Sudhanshu.
