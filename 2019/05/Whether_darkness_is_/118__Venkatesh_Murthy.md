Namaste

If you think deeply 100% Darkness is not bad like half Darkness. If it is
100% Dark you cannot see anything. You cannot see the snake even if it is
real. You cannot see the rope.

But in Half Darkness with a weak Light you start to see illusions. You see
a rope as a snake. You see a pillar as a man. And so on.

Zero Knowledge is not dangerous. A baby may try to play with a snake
because it has zero knowledge of snake. But half knowledge and incomplete
knowledge may cause fear in a man. Expert snake charmer has full knowledge
of snake and its moves and he is not afraid.
