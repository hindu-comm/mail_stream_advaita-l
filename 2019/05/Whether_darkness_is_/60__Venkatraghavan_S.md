Namaste Sudhanshu ji,

I haven't studied the work, but it may be because of the rule that for
every abhAva jnAna, one should have had pratiyogi jnAna first.

To know that a pot is absent on the table, one should have had prior
knowledge of a pot.

So, to know deepa Aloka abhAva one needs to have had jnAna of deepa Aloka
first.

Therefore, unless one has seen every kind of light in the universe, to
conclude that every light is absent is impossible.

Let's take two extremes - To know there is photon light abhAva, one has to
have seen the light from a photon first. To know the light from the
Andromeda galaxy is absent, one should have seen the Andromeda galaxy.
Without having seen both, how can one conclude that there is sarvAloka
abhAva present?

Kind regards,
Venkatraghavan
