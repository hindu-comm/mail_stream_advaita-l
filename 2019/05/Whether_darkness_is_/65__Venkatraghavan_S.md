Namaste Sudhanshu ji,
I would suggest you reread that last email I sent. Both your questions have
answers there.

The result of ~(A1 and A2 .. & An)  can be achieved even if A1=0, so there
is no need to wait for every Aloka.

Again, has been answered. To perceive those photons you need darkness,
without darkness the eyes don't have the capacity to see that level of
light.

So darkness and light have a mutually contradictory nature, but not of the
nature of presence and absence of light.
