Bhaskar ji,

And interestingly it is more of a question of Physics than of Philosophy.
Here is a claim that darkness is an object like table and chair and yet it
is not made of fluctuations of quantum fields or the modifications thereof
viz quarks and electrons but which comes into existence the moment you put
off the light. And it comes forth directly from Mula-karana like lightning
from clouds. झटिति.

Sudhanshu.
