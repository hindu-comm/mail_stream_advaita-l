what it should lead to is that:
darkness is !(A1 &&A2 &&A3.... &&An) which is clearly present when any
Aloka is absent and to take away darkness, all AlokAs necessarily need to
be there. The truth-table is of a simple NAND.

A1 A2 Darkness
0   0   1
0   1   1
1   0   1
1   1   0 (absence of darkness)
