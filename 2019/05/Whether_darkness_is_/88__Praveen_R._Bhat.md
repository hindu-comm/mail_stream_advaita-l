It surely does. Its not that the sub-commentators just wanted to say
something just for the heck of it. They were very well trained in nyAya,
unlike many who think it's optional and still consider theirs a debate! If
avidyA is abhAvarUpa, why would it need an Ashraya which none other than
Bhagavan Sureshvaracharya himself inquires and concludes into in
Naishkarmyasiddhi! Perhaps Bhagavatpadacharya didn't crosscheck it! :)

It is interesting to note that if vyAkhyAnas are wrong since they say
something that bhAShya didn't say, then if you apply that logic to bhAShya,
won't it prove it wrong as it says something that mUla didn't say?!
Ridiculous!
