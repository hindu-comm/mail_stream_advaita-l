Sudhanshu Ji,

Reg  << there is no drArshtAntika here. It is an independent discussion of
Vivarana
school as to whether darkness is bhava >>

and

<< Apart from this, I am curious to know as to how darkness is not merely
absence of photons having wavelength of 380-740 nm >>,

I am not sure if the following makes sense in the current context. You may
like to consider.

Darkness is not bhAva, it is bhAvarUpa. It is not a vastu  to be termed
bhAva. But since it conceals bhAvAs, it is termed bhAvarUpa.  It pertains
to jnAna, not artha. Presence or absence of photons or anything else does
not make for presence  or absence of darkness. However their noncognition
in the absence of anything else to hinder their cognition implies
darkness.

Regards
