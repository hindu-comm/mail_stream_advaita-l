This discussion on tamaH was regarded as important enough for all our Acharyas from SrI PadmapAda  to SrI vidyAraNya go to great pains to establish that avidyA is not abhAvarUpA. So although the discussion might seem to be a hair splitting one, it's not so .

If this avidyA which is not abhAvarUpa something different from jnAnAbhAva, saMshaya or vipareeta jnana then it will not go by jnana.  In Geeta shankara compares this avidya to tAmasa pratyaya, AvaraNAtmakatvAt etc.  but clearly says vivekaprakAshabhAve tadabhAvAt.  But unfortunately later vyAkhyAnakAra-s introduced new avidyA which is something different from above and which has the Ashraya in brahman itself.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
