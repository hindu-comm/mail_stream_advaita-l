While commenting on the mantra सत्यं च अनृतं च सत्यमभवत् ”satyam cha anRtam
cha Satyam abhavat’ (Taittiriya Up. II.6) Sri Shankaracharya says: satyam =
vyavaharavishayam since this is being mentioned in the context of ‘sRishti’
of the world. He adds: this is not paramArthasatyam (absolute reality)
since Brahman alone indeed is paramArtha satyam. This vyavaharavishayam
satyam is only Apekshikam, relative, empirical.
He explains: when compared to the water in a mirage, the water (that we
actually use for drinking, etc.) is real. This is what is meant by
‘vyavaharika satyam’.
That which is not thus real is anRtam, unreal.
सत्यं च व्यवहारविषयम्, अधिकारात्, न परमार्थसत्यम्; एकमेव हि परमार्थसत्यं
ब्रह्म । इह पुनः व्यवहारविषयमापेक्षिकं मृगतृष्णिकाद्यनृतापेक्षया उदकादि
सत्यमित्युच्यते । अनृतं च तद्विपरीतम् । किं पुनरेतत् सर्वं सत्यमभवत्
परमार्थसत्यम् ।//satyam cha vyavahaaraviShayam, adhikArAt, na
paramaarthasatyam; ekameva hi paramaarthasatyam Brahma. iha punaH
vyavahaaraviShayamaapekShikam mRgatRShNikAdyanRtaapekShayA udakAdi
satyamucyate. anRutam cha tadvipareetam. kim punaretat sarvam satyamabhavat

>From the above bhashya we understand that even the anRta, like mirage
water, shuktr-rajatam etc. is also bhAvarUpa. The mantra says: Brahman
'became' all this. Only hare's horn is not admitted as bhAvarupa as it is
abhAva, atyanta abhava. That is why this category has not been included by
the above shruti. Bhavarupa does not also mean paramarthika satyam.
