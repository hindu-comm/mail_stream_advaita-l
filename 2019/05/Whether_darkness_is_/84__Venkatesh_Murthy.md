Namaste

A zero watt light cannot destroy darkness in a big room. It is  like
medicine. If doctor has said take 2 tablets for sickness and you take only
1/2 tablet. The sickness will not be cured.

Light of sufficient wattage must be present to destroy darkness completely.
This is also showing Darkness is Bhava Rupa. If it is strictly Absence of
Light even a zero watt bulb should have destroyed darkness in a big room.
But we know it will not.
