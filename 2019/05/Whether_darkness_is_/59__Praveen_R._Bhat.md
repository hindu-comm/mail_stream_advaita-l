Yes there will be darkness as it is defined as absence of "all light."
Here, there is no absence of all light, but absence of one light. Imagine a
scenario that you have n zero-bulbs in your room. Unless you light up all
bulbs, it remains dark enough to read your book. Now, what is darkness?
Even if you switch off one bulb, it is dark. You may be thinking of
something of pitch-dark which you already know of, but that is not the
definition of darkness here, is it?!

Please interpret the definition with a vigraha-vAkya is you think the
interpretation is wrong. I’m curious to see how you arrived at the formula
in the first place as to whether it was by shabda-mimAMsA or meaning
presumed regardless of the word.

In any case, I suggest you to go with the definition and refutation as
given by SV. If you have a definition for which kind of abhAva is darkness
and it makes sense to you, please mention those and explain how those are
not covered by SV in any of the three, if that.
