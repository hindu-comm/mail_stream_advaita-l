Hari Om V Subramanian ji,

1. //Shankara clearly says that tamas, included in the list and tejas as
well...constitute the adhidaivatam and that they are all devatas // You
mean tamas i.e. the outside darkness itself is the adhidaivata? When
Prithivi does not refer to the astronomical prithivi, then how can tamas
refer to the outside darkness? Tamas represents Mritya devata. That is
quite clear.

2. The question is whether a devata must necessarily refer to a positive
objective entity. There is no such rule. For example direction. For example
Aditya adhidaivata refers to rupa such as shukla and krishna. Now krishna
is absence of shukla as admitted even by Chitsukhi. So no claim can be made
that adhidaivata must necessarily refer to a positive entity. रूपाण्येव
यस्यायतनम् । रूपाणि शुक्लकृष्णादीनि । य एवासावादित्ये पुरुषः — सर्वेषां हि
रूपाणां विशिष्टं कार्यमादित्ये पुरुषः, तस्य का देवतेति — सत्यमिति होवाच ;
सत्यमिति चक्षुरुच्यते ; चक्षुषो हि अध्यात्मत आदित्यस्याधिदैवतस्य
निष्पत्तिः. (Brihad Aranyak 3.9.12) न च अयम् औपचारिक आलोकाभावे,
शौक्ल्याभावे पटादौ नीलव्यवहारे इव इति युक्तम्, मुख्ये बाधभावात्.(चित्सुखी)


3. Mrityu is the adhidaivata for tamas does not mean that Mrityu-devata
lives 'in' tamas as mentioned in //*तम एव यस्यायतनम् । तम इति
शार्वराद्यन्धकारः परिगृह्यते ; *अध्यात्मं
छायामयः अज्ञानमयः पुरुषः ; *तस्य का देवतेति — मृत्युरिति होवाच
*;मृत्युरधिदैवतं तस्य निष्पत्तिकारणम् ॥ Surely, if 'tamah' is being
described as the abode of a deity, surely the
abode has to be an existent entity?"

Tamas is *not* the abode of Mrityu-devata. There are three entities here.
(i) tamas (ii) the ajnana-maya purusha (iii) the devata of
ajnana-maya-purusha. Tamas is the ayatana or ashraya of ajnana-maya-purusha
and NOT that of Mrityu-devata. Discussion of abode of devata is *not* mentioned
here. Further, if one were to say that the ajnana-maya-purusha lives in
tamas then that obviously is not the case here because that purusha is
within this karya-karana-samghata and not in outside tamas. So, no claim of
positive-ness can be made on account of abode because that is not mentioned
here at all.

4. Ayatana is not in the sense of abode. Otherwise we will need to infer
Aditya-stha-puruSha to live in krishna-rupa which is admittedly an abhava.
Or kAma-maya-puruSha to live 'in' kAma. Point 3 is also supported here
because women, who are kama-uddipaka and who are devata of
kama-maya-purusha, don't live 'in' kama but they live in house of
kama-maya-purusha. काम एव यस्यायतनम् । स्त्रीव्यतिकराभिलाषः कामः कामशरीर
इत्यर्थः । हृदयं लोकः, हृदयेन बुद्ध्या पश्यति । य एवायं काममयः पुरुषः
अध्यात्ममपि काममय एव, तस्य का देवतेति — स्त्रिय इति होवाच ; स्त्रीतो हि
कामस्य दीप्तिर्जायते

5. Even in 6.2.11 //रात्रिः अर्चिः, समित्सम्बन्धप्रभवसामान्यात् ; अग्नेः
समित्सम्बन्धेन हि अर्चिः सम्भवति, तथा पृथिवीसमित्सम्बन्धेन शर्वरी ;
*पृथिवीछायां हि शार्वरं तम आचक्षते *// I fail to appreciate as to how this
supports the view of darkness as some positive entity. On the contrary,
Acharya is quite clearly saying that darkness is nothing but shadow of
earth. Discussion will arise on the meaning of shadow. One will say it to
be absence of light and the other as some positive entity. Similarly the
other quotes from Anandagiri reference does not add anything new and need
understanding the concept of shadow itself.
