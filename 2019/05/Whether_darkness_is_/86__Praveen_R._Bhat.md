Namaste all,

Since there is always a "mischievous" misinterpretation of the vyAkhyAnas,
let me clarify that bhAvarUpa said to be yatkinchidbhAvarUpa is not
pAramArthika; no sane advaitin can think so, let alone vyAkhyAnakAras!
Further, if a complete abhAvarUpa ajnAna can be the cause of bondage,
nitya-mokSha is impossible as there is no guarantee that it won't cause
bondage yet again! jnAnamastIti chenna, since such knowledge has nothing
bhAvarUpa to act upon, it can easily come and go. Else what is jnAna going
to take away? Earlier there was no jnAna; having got it, one has to hold on
to it, like yogakShema of everything else! If this jnAna goes away due to
memory loss as someone asked, non existent jnAna = ajnAna, thereby a person
is bound again!! Instead, if ajnAna is yatkinchidbhAvarUpa, it is destroyed
by jnAna, a person is free; whether or not this jnAna is held on to using
memory! This jnAna forgotten also cannot bring back ajnAna.
