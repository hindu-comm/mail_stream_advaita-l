Although it may seem convenient to switch to pratyakSha after making an
Aropa on Bhagavan Vidyaranya as apparently using "bizarre logic", all this
means is that darkness is not sarvAlokAbhAva either. If one were to use
pratyAkSha too, I see darkness is a valid experience instead of I see
absence of light.

Kind rgds,
