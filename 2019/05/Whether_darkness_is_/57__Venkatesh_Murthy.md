Namaste

Light can be blocked by a solid object. Then we will have shadow. What is
shadow? It is another form of darkness only. In a room there are solid
objects and also lights. When you switch on only 1 light there will be
shadows of the objects. The shadows will not have any light but darkness.
How to remove shadows? You must switch on all lights from every angle in
the room. Then only there will be no shadow and no darkness. This is also a
NAND example.
