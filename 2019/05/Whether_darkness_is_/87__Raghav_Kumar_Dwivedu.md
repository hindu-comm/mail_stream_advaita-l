That's an excellent point. I always 'knew' that a jnAnI may forget all the
shAstra vAkyas, their meanings and prakriyAs in old age or in an accident,
but the GYAnam and moxaH do not go away.

But I did not realise the connection you mentioned that, if it is
abhAvarUpA avidyA, then if the memory of shAstra vAkyas etc., is lost in
old age etc., the abhAvarUpa avidyA can make a comeback. And so abhAvarUpA
avidyA implies anirmoxa-prasangaH.
