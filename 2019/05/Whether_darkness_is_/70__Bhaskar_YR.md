A1 , A2 etc are light sources.
~A1 implies A1 is switched off.

sarvAloka = (A1 AND A2 ...ad infinitum)
~(sarvAloka) = ~A1 OR ~A2 OR .... etc.

What exactly is the 'dAshtrAntika' here ??  Being a below average student of maths and science I have lost myself in these equations.  If avidyA is compared to darkness and light as jnana then please explain this by using avidyA and vidya terms so that dull wits like me would atleast come to know the problem being discussed here.  Thanks in advance.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
