Namaste

Your law for lunch will be slightly different.

Have Lunch = Hungry AND Food Available AND Time for Lunch Available with
Boss permission
If you are Hungry and Food is available and Time for Lunch Available with
permission of boss you will have Lunch.

Not Have Lunch = Not Hungry OR Not Food Available OR Not Time for Lunch
Available with Boss permission
You are not having Lunch means You are Not Hungry OR Food not available OR
Boss did not permission time for Lunch.

The darkness question was like this. If Darkness is absence of all light
will one light destroy Darkness?  Or will all lights be necessary to
destroy Darkness?

I think the answer is we have to know the Adhisthana of Darkness. WHere is
it present? Is it in one small empty place or a big place? If small one
light may be sufficient. If place is big many lights be necessary.
