Hari Om Venkatesh ji,

Pl see the attachment of my previous post wherein I have given the
screenshot. This does not seem to be import. There is darkness at this
place at this point of time. What is it? Whether it is aloka-matra-abhava
or aloka-vishesha-abhava or sarva-aloka-abhava . This is the question.
There is no such question of darkness in a house comprising five rooms.
That analogy does not appear to be apt here. Pl see the screenshot.

Regards.
Sudhanshu.
