But here tamas refers to Mrityu devata just as prithivi does not refer to
astronomical body prithivi but to prithivi devata. Moreover, this is
adhidaivata-prakarana, then how can by the word tamas is taken the
darkness? If you take here literal meaning then you will have to take even
direction as some bhava padarth like chair and table because even that is
enlisted. By the word dik, Ashvini Kumaras are meant and so on.

Regards,
Sudhanshu.
