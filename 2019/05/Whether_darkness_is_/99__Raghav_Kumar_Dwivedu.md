Namaste Sudhanshu ji
The earlier mantras from antaryAmi brAhmaNam suffice as pramANam, i
understand, viz.,
B.U.3.7.13

यस्तमसि तिष्ठंस्तमसोऽन्तरो यं तमो न वेद यस्य तमः शरीरं यस्तमोऽन्तरो
यमयत्येष त आत्मान्तर्याम्यमृतः ॥ १३ ॥

Notice the very next mantra is about tejas (luminosity/radiance) which is
the counterpart of tamas (darkness).

यस्तेजसि तिष्ठंस्तेजसोऽन्तरो यं तेजो न वेद यस्य तेजः शरीरं यस्तेजोऽन्तरो
यमयत्येष त आत्मान्तर्याम्यमृत इत्यधिदैवतमथाधिभूतम् ॥ १४ ॥

There seems to be no BhAshya parsing the word tamas.

Does the varttika or Teekaa say anything different about tamas other than
that it's the counterpart of Tejas which is referenced in the very next
mantra? I have not seen them.

You suggested tamas here is not the devatA of darkness but the devatA of
mRtyu. Can you please quote the reference for that?
