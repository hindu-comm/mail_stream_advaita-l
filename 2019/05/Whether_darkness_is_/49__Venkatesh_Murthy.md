Namaste

I have not studied VPS but I think you may be misunderstanding it.

There are 5 rooms in a house and a light in every room. At night when all
lights are switched off there total darkness in the house. When 1 light is
switched on there is no darkness in 1 room but darkness in 4 rooms. When 2
lights are switched on there is no darkness in 2 rooms and darkness is in 3
rooms. And so on. When all 5 lights are switched on there is no darkness in
any room. Then only we can say there is no darkness in the house. Even when
only one room has darkness we cannot say darkness is not there in the house.
