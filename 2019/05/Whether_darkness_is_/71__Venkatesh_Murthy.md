You meet a friend after lunch hour. You ask him Did you have lunch? He says
No. You know one thing is true. If he is hungry at lunch hour AND food is
available means he will always have lunch. If he is not hungry he will not
have lunch. If food is not available he will not have lunch. But now he is
saying he did not have lunch. What is the reason? It can be he is not
hungry at lunch hour OR food was not available. This is DeMorgan's Law.
Have Lunch = Hungry AND Food Available
Not Have Lunch = Not Hungry OR Not Food Available
