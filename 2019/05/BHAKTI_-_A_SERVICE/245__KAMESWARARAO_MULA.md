Dear Members, Bhakti can be Nirguna or saguna. As per veda it is of nine (9) types.1. Hearing (sravanam) 2. Chanting (kirtanam) 3. Remembering ( visnusmaranam)
4. Serving Lotus Feet (pada sevanam) 5.Deity - Worship (arcanam) 6.Praying (vandanam) 7. Excuting Orders (dasyam) 8. Servingas a Friend (sakhyam)
9. Complete Surrender (atma nivedanam)
>From the Ananda Sagara tatwam of Nilkantha Dikshitar:If the service is to be called as Bhakti, it involves adirect entry into the path of action and It is well known that the servant is required by theMaster’s being pleased with him. If Bhakti is contemplation, it is a methodwith which we are already familiar as it is the third in order from sravana inthe path of Jnana.Nilkantha Prey’s the mother that Sri Appayya Diskhita hasdedicated entire progeny of his line to you and you can’t forget of his hereditaryslave or can desist in serving you the hereditary goddess. Oh! Mother, to hearthe twinkling music of your anklets and rush forward with compassion towards meduring my last moments, your child is fearless even if he is surrounded by themessenger of the death.I feel a prayer likethis will bestows the siddhi and makes the path way to liberation.A prayer should be like this so that we should forget the rest of the world except thegod/goddess so that tears will cum automatically with atma-nivedanam
