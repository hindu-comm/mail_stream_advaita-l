Namaste Anandji,

Thank you for authoring and sharing these wonderful verses on
Nrsimhajayanti with such variety of content, some of which I am still
trying to get into fully, especially due to a lack of understanding of the
metres. Meanwhile, may I ask a couple of grammatical clarifications as
below?

In my understanding, the above two verses make a single anvaya. If that is
so, with the iti in verse 10, shouldn't all of non-neuter words, viz.
harim, tam and devam, be in prathamA? Or without iti, the word AtmA be in
dvitIyA?

Here too, wouldn't the iti-pada need the puMlinga word mantra, etc, in
prathamA?

Incidentally, LakshmiNrsimha is the kuladevatA on my mother's side whose
darshana my mother had last month after around 40 years!
