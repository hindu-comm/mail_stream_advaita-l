A beautiful article & message from Parama Shraddheya Ramsukhdas Ji Maharaj :

>  But according to some all are eligible for jnana but NOT mOksha as the mOksha can happen ONLY after taking sannyasa (sannyasa here means Ashrama sannyasa not mere vairAgya).  BTW, jnana is not mOksha as per some prakaraNa.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
