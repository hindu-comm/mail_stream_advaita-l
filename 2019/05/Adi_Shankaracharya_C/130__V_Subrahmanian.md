An excerpt:

There is not one branch of knowledge which Shankara has left unexplored and
which has not
received the touch, polish and finish of his superhuman intellect. The
loftiness,
calmness and
firmness of his mind, the impartiality with which he deals with various
questions, his
clearness of expression-all these make us revere the philosopher more and
more. We may say
that his teachings will continue to live as long as the sun shines.
Shankara's scholarly erudition and his masterly way of exposition of intricate
philosophical
problems have won the admiration of all the philosophical schools of the world
at the present
moment. Shankara was an intellectual genius, a profound philosopher, an
able propagandist, a
matchless preacher, a gifted poet and a great religious reformer. Perhaps,
never in the history
of any literature, a stupendous writer like him has been found. Even
the Western
scholars of
the present day pay their homage and respects to him. Of all the
ancient systems,
that of
Shankaracharya will be found to be the most congenial and the most easy of
acceptance to the
modern mind.15
