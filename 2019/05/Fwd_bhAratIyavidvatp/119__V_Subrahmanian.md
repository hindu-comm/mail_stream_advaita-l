RESPECTED SCHOLARS,
                                         NEARLY A DECADE AGO SAMSKRITA
BHARATHI HAS CONDUCTED SHALAKA EXAMINATION IN HYDERABAD.EVEN OUR GROUP
MEMBER SRI ARAVIND RAO SIR HAS ATTENDED THE MEETING AS A GUEST ON THAT DAY .

ON THAT DAY A C.D. WHICH HAD COMPLETE AUDIO OF BHAGAVADGITA WITH SANKARA
BHASHYA WAS DISTRIBUTED .

I MISSED THAT C.D. I TRIED IN INTERNET AND IN ALL THE KNOWN SOURCES BUT
FAILED TO GET THAT C.D.

IF ANYBODY HAS THAT C.D. I REQUEST THEM TO UPLOAD THAT IN TO THE INTERNET
AND PROVIDE THE LINK HERE.

                                                                THANK YOU.
