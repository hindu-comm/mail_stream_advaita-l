Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} शंकर जयन्ती संस्मरणम् - डा० अरविन्द रायः
(संस्कृत उपन्यासः)
To: भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


During Shankara Jayanti in the year 2015, our revered member Dr.K.Aravinda
Rao Ji delivered a short sanskrit lecture remembering Sankara
Bhagavatpada.

A short, sweet and crisp message that I cherish and listen to this every
year ! This needs to be contemplated again and again till it sinks in mind.
