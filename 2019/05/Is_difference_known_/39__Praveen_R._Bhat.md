For once, you are right! Informed through study overview, yes;
well-informed through detailed study, no. I get more by studying advaita-
than by refuting dvaita-darshana beyond those done in bhAShya and TIkAs.

So by that you would be saying that one who has studied only Shruti and not
any non-Shruti text cannot arrive at anything! That doesn't even seem close
to right. All that one needs is his indriyas working to study shruti under
an Acharya and I am sure one can get vedAnta, vedAnAM antaH nirNayaH and
thereby, mokSha. OTOH, those who study non-shruti texts and call that as
Vedanta find themselves answering the question as to why is their darshana
called Vedanta at all!

Thanks for confirming the dvaita-stance, which is why I think that your
main pramANa is not Shruti and hence I wondered why it is called as
Vedanta. Please enlighten me, if possible, as to why is dvaita-darshana
called Vedanta as each time a dvaitin says something I find myself more and
more curious.

I don't agree. shukti-rajata has multiple pramANas working and
contradicting all the same. If you insist there is rajata, I will have to
remind you that you are still to provide me with silver from last time's
discussion!

Perhaps so for a non-Vedantin. Still, better that than shruti-virodha for a
Vedantin.
