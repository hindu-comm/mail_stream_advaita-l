Swami NikhilAnanda's translation -- Now it is asked whether nonduality can be established only by scriptural evidence or whether it can be proved by reasoning as well.
It is said in reply that it is possible to establish nonduality by reasoning as well. How is it possible? This is shown in this chapter of Advaita.

I donâ€™t think it means tarka / reasoning / logic alone is a separate / independent pramANa.  Shankara insists about shrutyanugraheeta tarka.  Elsewhere he clearly denies the validity of 'nirAgama tarka / shushka tarka which is manufactured in the conditioned minds of some intellects without the support of shruti / shabda pramANa.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
