"Therefore esa, this-this wisdom about the Self, as presented by Vedas, that arises when the Self is taught by one who has become identified with It; na apaneya, i.e. na prapaniya, is not to be attained; tarkena, through argumentation-called up merely by one's own intellect. Or (reading the word as a-apaneya, the expression na apaneya means), should not be eradicated, should not be destroyed. *For a logician who is not versed in the Vedas, talks of all sorts of things that can be called up by his own intellect. *Therefore, prestha, O dearest one; *this wisdom that originates from the Vedas, sujnanaya (bhavati), leads to sound knowledge; when prokta, imparted; anyena, eva, by a different person indeed-by a teacher who is versed in the Vedas and is different from the logician.*"

Very apt quote.  This also reminds me shankara's observations in sUtra bhAshya ( not remembered where exactly...shAstra yOnitvAdhikaraNa ??  not sure) Agama mAtra samadhigamya eva tu ayamarthaH dharmavatu...shrutyanubraheeta eva he atra tarkaH anubhavAngatvena Ashreeyate because brahman is rUpAdyabhAvat hi nAyamarthaH pratyakshasya gOcharaH, lingAdi abhAvAccha na anumAdeenAM etc.
