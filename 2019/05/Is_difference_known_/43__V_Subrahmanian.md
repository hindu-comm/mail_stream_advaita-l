The last that you have said is the end part of the 4th sutra bhashya where
Shankara cites an early advaitin whom later scholars have identified as
Sundara Pandya who has written on Purva Mimamsa too.

Also, the PM 'apaccheda nyaya' has been invoked by Advaitins to show that
the pramana that gave a certain knowledge first is negated/overruled by a
later pramana.  Hence pratyaksha that ruled in a person's life until he
comes to the shruti (vedanta) is contradicted by the shruti pramana.
pUrvam pareNa baadhyate.

Also, Sri Vidyaranya in the Panchadashi 2.34 says:

चोद्यं वा परिहारो वा क्रियतां द्वैतभाषया ।

अद्वैतभाषया चोद्यं नास्ति नापि तदुत्तरम् ॥ ३४॥

Questioning and answering can happen only through the medium of bheda,
dvaita. In the realm of Advaita there is neither question nor an answer.

This is the stance of Advaitins. All comparing, vichara, viveka, sattaa
travidhya vichaara, etc. have to happen in the dvaita bheda language alone.
That is not any shortcoming of abheda vaadins. From the Paramarthika abheda
advaita realm, however, the earlier viveka, vichara, comparison using
bheda, etc. are all negated wholesale. So the mithya
vichara/viveka/comparison, etc. are sublated by the satya advaita
nishprapancha absolute drishti. Gaudapada's paraphrasing the upanishadic
verse: na nirodho......depicts this idea alone.
