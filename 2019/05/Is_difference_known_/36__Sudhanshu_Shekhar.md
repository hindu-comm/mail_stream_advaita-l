Hari Om Srinatha ji.

There are two quotes of Bhagvan Bhashyakara which show us His mind. One can
easily understand therefrom that pramanas do not contradict each other.
Thus, if Shruti contradicts either pratyaksha or upapatti, then Shruti is
to be explained in another fashion.

(1)न हि श्रुतिशतमपि ‘शीतोऽग्निरप्रकाशो वा’ इति ब्रुवत् प्रामाण्यमुपैति ।
यदि ब्रूयात् ‘शीतोऽग्निरप्रकाशो वा’ इति, तथापि अर्थान्तरं श्रुतेः विवक्षितं
कल्प्यम् , प्रामाण्यान्यथानुपपत्तेः, न तु प्रमाणान्तरविरुद्धं
स्ववचनविरुद्धं वा (Bhagvad Gita Bhashya 18.66) -- for Pratyaksha

(2) अतश्च श्रुत्युपपत्तिविरोधाद्बहिष्कुलायश्रुतिः गौणी व्याख्यातव्या
(Brahma Sutra Bhashya 3.2.3) -- for Upapatti

Therefore, the view of Bhashyakara in this domain is not different from
dvaita people. His view is as follows :-

यत्तु उक्तम् ‘श्रुतिप्रामाण्यात्’ इति, तत् न ; तत्प्रामाण्यस्य
अदृष्टविषयत्वात् । प्रत्यक्षादिप्रमाणानुपलब्धे हि विषये
अग्निहोत्रादिसाध्यसाधनसम्बन्धे श्रुतेः प्रामाण्यम् , न प्रत्यक्षादिविषये,
अदृष्टदर्शनार्थविषयत्वात् प्रामाण्यस्य. Please note the usage प्रत्यक्ष -
**आदि**. This आदि word encompasses all other pramana in its ambit.

Regards.
Sudhanshu.
