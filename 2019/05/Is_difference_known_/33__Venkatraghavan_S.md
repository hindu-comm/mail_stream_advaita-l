Namaste Praveen ji,
Thank you. Hope that opportunity arises - for both of us!

Re your point on role of Shruti in dvaita, both dvaita and advaita agree
that Shruti reveals what pratyaksha does not / cannot reveal.

Similar to our प्रत्यक्षेण अनुमित्या वा यस्तूपायो न बुध्यते। एनं विन्दति
वेदेन तस्मात् वेदस्य वेदता।

Where we differ is that where pratyaksha and Shruti are in conflict, they
hold that pratyaksha will prevail.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
