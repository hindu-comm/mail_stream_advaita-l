Missed the point. The reason I brought the difference between shruti and
non-shruti is that unless you know (and convince) shruti is a valid pramANa
for our final purushArtha, you cannot even venture to study vedAnta. Why
would anyone? Having said this, there is this fundamental difference you
need to recognize between shruti as pramANa and non-shruti (other
scriptures or texts) as apramANa. Otherwise why do you reject Kuran or
Bible or Toraha etc.? So, the pratyaksha is indeed the adhistAna on which
the entire topic of vEda-pramANya is established. Do not forget the
'shruti' aspect of Veda is indeed a pratyaksha aspect of "shravaNatvaM"
(hearing). You cannot negate pratyaksha in the name of vedanta.

Did I say main pramANa (what is the "main" means anyway?)  is pratyaksha
and not shruti?

No problem, read advaita siddhi to begin with.

rajata darshana is not yathArtha jnAna hence not pramANa. Dvaita defines
pramANa is 'yathArtham pramANaM'. So, the rajata you think you see is in
fact a brAnti and hence the final perception of shukti is contradicting
your brAnti and not another pratyaksha per se.

Davita is not saying all perceptions are valid.

 Even for you to say this, you need to see the difference between Vedantin
and non-Vedantin. Then the question is -- where are you seeing this from?
from Pratyaksha or Shruti? If former, you are indeed non-vedantin as per
your own rule. If later, there is no difference between you and other
"non-vedantins" as your position id absolute non-difference!
