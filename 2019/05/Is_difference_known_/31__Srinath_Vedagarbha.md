Is this pAramArthika *different* from transnational or not? If yes, what is
the nature of that "difference"? If itself is transactional, then there is
absolutely no-difference between them really from final analysis  and hence
all the difference you see is pAramArtha-cally real and never go away.

Even for you, to negate this dvaita prapancha, you need to maintain at
least "a difference" (between paramArtha and vyavahAra) in your model. See,
you cannot get away with the difference!
