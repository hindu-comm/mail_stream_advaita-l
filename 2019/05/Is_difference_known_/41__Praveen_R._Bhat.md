shraddhA. Now if you say that also has dependency on pratyakSha, I'll ask
you how do you trust pratyakSha without shraddhA that indriyas give you
right knowledge?!

Vedas are apaurusheya. Beyond that, no comments. This is going all over the
place, except where it needs to be.

So, the pratyaksha is indeed the adhistAna on which the entire topic of

Not so. If any pramANa depends on another for its prAmANya, it's not
pramANa. pratyakSha being necessary for all pramANas to function doesn't
mean that their prAmaNya is due to it!

Do not forget the 'shruti' aspect of Veda is indeed a pratyaksha aspect of

This is like saying that I'm born due to my parents and therefore my
parents are always right! You should necessarily accept pratyakSha in all
cases when anumAna opposes it too then!

Main means what you confirmed in your very next mail to Venkatji by calling
it prAbalyam/strongest. You may kindly use that word if it helps.

No need, that's neither the purpose of AS nor is it to be "begun with" as
pointed to you in an earlier discussion. Moreover, since you've directed me
to advaitagrantha to understand dvaita, I already know it from such
sources. Thanks, my conclusion has become firmer.

rajata darshana is not yathArtha jnAna hence not pramANa. Dvaita defines

Why is shukti not bhrAnti? Why is one pratyakSha stronger than the other?
Haven't you used anumAna here? If so, why is anumAna stronger than
pratyakSha? Isn't it upajIva?

Exactly so. Take it all the way says Vedanta.

If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. We don't use one
pramANa for everything.

If former, you are indeed non-vedantin as per your own rule.

Not so. We have sattA-bheda that you cannot take Ashraya of!

If later, there is no difference between you and other "non-vedantins" as

True. There's no difference in absolute reality. ekamevAdvitiyam.
