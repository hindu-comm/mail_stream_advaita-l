Well, you seems to be not informed on davita darshana and their bAshya on
dashOpanishats.

Pratyakska is upajIva for shruti. Unless you cognize the *difference*
between shruti and non-shruti texts, you cannot even arrive at non-duality
let alone anything else in the name of "vedAnta".  Given this fact, a given
pramANa (shruti) cannot override another pramANa, that too the later is
upajIva for the former. What one can say is a pramANa can extend the
knowledge provided from another pramANa and never contradict it.

Interpreting shruti in terms of absolute non-duality is upajIva-virodha
flaw.
