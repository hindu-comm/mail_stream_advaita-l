Namaste Srinath ji
You are making a mistake in assuming that the knowledge revealed by one
pramANa cannot later on be contradicted by another pramANa.

When two pramANa-s clash there is no rule that one will always overrule the
other.

In case Shruti talks of agni as sheetaH , there pratyaxa is accepted and
arthAntara is looked for in interpreting Shruti.

When the modern scientific nihilists deny that consciousness exists etc .,
there Shruti overruled anumAna etc by showing the latter to be fallacious.
(This needs efforts of course.)

No knowledge is final . It can always be overruled by subsequent pramANas.
This is true for all pramANas upto the Vedic karma kANDam.

The only exception is Advaita GYAnam which is uncobtradictabke once it
arises, since it shows the very framework of pramAtravam and the
pramAtr-pramANa-prameya tripuTi to be mithyA. Therefore no subsequent
pramANa vyApAram can sublate or contradict advitIya brahmAtma GYANam.
