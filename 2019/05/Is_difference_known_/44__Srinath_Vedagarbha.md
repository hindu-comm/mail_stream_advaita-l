The difference does not just that -- advaita's paxa is that shruti pramANa
(any pramANa for that matter) is itself in the realm of avidya and chooses
Shruti selectively, mislabeling some
as "atatvaavedaka" and "anuvaadaka." etc. On the other hand, Dvaita vAdins
accepts entire sprecturm of vEdic texts as conveying ultimate reality as
per Shruti's own saying 'sarvE vEdA yatpadamAmananti ......tadviShNOH
paramam padam'. There is no artificial division of karama kAnDa and jnyAna
kAnDa, tavavEdaka & attavavEdaka etc.

Logic is not a primary tool for Tatvavaada; Madhva quotes Vyaasa as saying
"praabalyam aagamasya eva," and accepts this dictum fully; Scripture is the
strongest of the pramaanas. when it comes to atIndritya tatva vivhAra.
However, logic does have an important supporting role, in showing
self-contradiction in other possible hypotheses, etc. Logic cannot be be
discarded otherwise why MS and others relay on nyAya?

When shruti is denying realizing Brahman via any other than Shruti "*nendriyANi
nAnumAnaM vedA hyevainaM vedayanti tasmAdAhuH vedAH"  Shankara in totally
opposite stand says "**advaitaM kim AgamamAtrENa pratipattavyam AhOsvit
tarkENApi **ityata aha - SakyatE tarkEnApi  j~nAtuM;
tatkathamityadvaita- **prakaraNam
ArabhyatE...." (**Sankara's introductory commentary **to Chapter 3 advaita
prakaraNa of kaarika)*

Swami NikhilAnanda's translation -- Now it is asked whether nonduality can
be established only by scriptural evidence or whether it can be proved by
reasoning as well.
It is said in reply that it is possible to establish nonduality by
reasoning as well. How is it possible? This is shown in this chapter of
Advaita.

There are many instance to show how the non-duality proponent opposed to
very vEdic stand, but too little time to mention here.
