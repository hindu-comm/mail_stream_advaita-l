Namaste Venkatji,

Thanks for another wonderful presentation of a segment from AS. I have not
been able to follow your series at all, but I do hope that at the end of it
all, you do publish it as a book (hard-copy, of course). I'd be very
interested to buy the same as it seems very unlikely that I'll be able to
study AS before that!

This dvaita-pUrvapakSha again brings me back to the question I have
oft-asked that when pratyakSha proves dvaita to them, in their view what
exactly is shruti pramANa for and how does their take qualify as Vedanta!

Kind rgds,
