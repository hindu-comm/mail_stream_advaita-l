Dear Readers,
Here is a shloka from mahabharata which reads as follows :maunAnna sa munirBavati nAraNyavasanAnmuniH |svalakShaNaM tu yO vEda sa muniSrEShTha ucyatE ||
The second line of this Shloka gives in a nutshellstates in very clear terms the work to be doneby a student of vedanta. It is self explanatory.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy,a reader from this group whom theadvice from Sage Vedavyasa touchedthe very bottom of his heart.
