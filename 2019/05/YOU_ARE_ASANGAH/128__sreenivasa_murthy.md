Dear friends,
Sri Rupert Spira says :Quote:Dear friends,
Sri Rupert Spira says : At every moment and under all circumstances 
 I, Awareness, 
 am free from and simultaneously one 
 with all experience.

Unquote.Sri Shankara says : AtmA sarvagatatvAt sarvA-ananyatvAt ca ||Sruti says : asaMgO hi ayam purShaH ||
 Atman is everywhere and he is one with everything 
 yet untouched by them.This is one's anuBava also.You are in both the states of waking and dreamand yet untouched by the contents of the two states.The person, the entity 'me' is also 
included in the contents of the states.The states come and go, they change, the contents change.But YOU IN YOUR TRUE SVARUPA NEITHER COME NOR GO.YOU ARE THE CHANGELESS SUBSTRATUM 
from which the states emerge out 
and to which they merge back.
The above stated facts can be ascertained 
by referring to your own anuBava ofwaking and dream states.
with respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
