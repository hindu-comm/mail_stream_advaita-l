The 'Vishnu' of Shankara and that of Ramanuja

Here is an article, of 11 pages, which is a short study based on literary
evidence from the writings of both Shankara and Ramanuja that shows the
idea of 'Vishnu' is different for both these Acharyas. This article is not
intended to invoke polemical discussions. The sole aim is to bring to the
fore the fact of fundamental difference in the perspectives of both the
Acharyas with regard to the concept of 'Vishnu'.
