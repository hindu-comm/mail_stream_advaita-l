Dear Members,             Vatuka Vamana, who appeared in disguise as a beggar in a sacrifice that was being performed by Bali chakravarthi was very attracted to the beauty of the Lord. The king Bali had a Guru. There are two types of Gurus. One is Guru on the basis of birth. It goes from the father to the son. The father was on Gaddi and now the son must also sit on Gaddi. I saw in nimisarnya there are vyasa gaddi, Bhardwaj gaddi like this which comes in the lineage of that family and there are many sampradayas where the Gaddi is on the basis of birth. Another guru is on the basis of qualification. Bali had guru Sukaracharya like this. Sukra means semen. So Sukaracharya was his guru on the basis of seminal discharge or on the basis of birth. Sukaracharya came to know that his disciple Bali has offered to give Vamana enough land equal to three footsteps.
Sukaracharya knew that this beggar is not a ordinary beggar but is God Himself which he snuffed it. So Sukaracharya told Bali, vamana is not a beggar, He is the Lord and He has come to take away all your riches, fames and he will put you down, So don’t honor his promise. You can tell Him that you were joiked/lieing and there is no harm in telling like that. Bali said this earth can tolerate the weight of the mountains, this earth can tolerate the weight of the oceans and rivers but it can not tolerate the weight of a liar. Bali said I cannot lie, Truthfulness is one of the essential ingredients of religion. Religion means you must be truthful, you must be austere, you must believe in cleanliness and you must have mercy.

Sukracharya tried to convince Bali that you can tell lies in emergency situations, in woman issues, in marriage matter & in the protection of cows and tell vamana that you lied him.

Bali convinces sukaracharya that if Vishnu comes to me and begs for three foots of land then I should keep my promise. If we are not truthful, if we are deceitful, cunning and untruthful, then materially we may succeed but spiritually we will fail and our real goal should be to succeed spiritually and not materially. So Bali refused to go back on the commitment that he had given to Vamana. He refused to lie Vamana being the incarnation of the Supreme Lord, did something uncommon and rest of the story we all know.

So the take home message is that Lord performs superhuman activities when he appears as avatara that cannot be performed by any ordinary person. That is the reason , till today people in Keral Rastram celebrates ‘Onam’ in the name of Bali chakravarthi.

 Dear Members, The cause for birth is our own karma. Whether youdo good or bad, all that makes you take birth again and again, experiencethe consequences of our own karma. Our dharma, the Hindu dharma , is one whichhas faith in the doctrines of karma, of rebirth, and of the characteristics ofan Avathar.This will become veryevident to us in the story of Narasimha Avathar. The good karma of Prahlada andthe bad karma of Hiranya Kasipa are bothresponsible for Visnhuappearing in the form of Narasimha.Here is anotherstory. Once, when Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana were going to the forest in achariot, Dasaratha came running behind the chariot and shouted, “Stop, stop.”Samantha, who was driving the chariot, the Charioter looked at Rama as thoughasking Him if he should stop the chariot. Rama said, “Go on, go on.” After some distance,Samantha turned to Rama and said, “It would have been very good if I, too,could stay with you in the forest for years. But when I go back to the city,Dasaratha will ask me, ‘Why did you not stop the chariot?’ What shall I say?”Rama said, “Oh, say that you could nothear his words.” Is that an untruth? No,Surprisingly not what Rama said.There are manyreasons for this. Rama had to go to the forest, If he delays going, He would becausing great sorrow to his parents. There is another reason. In his capacityas king, Dasaratha had given a boon to Kaikeyi. To fulfill that boon, he hadbanished Rama to the forest [against his paternal inclinations]. But on the daywhen Dasaratha was asking the chariot to stop, he wanted to have another lookat Rama. He was acting in the capacity of a father, not a king. This order connected to the relationshipthat exists between a father and a son; it had nothing to do with a king.So Rama told Samantha, “You have obeyed the orders of your king. You did notobey the orders given by my father.” Weshould observe the important distinction that Rama made between king and father.Another examplewe can take from vamana avatar.
