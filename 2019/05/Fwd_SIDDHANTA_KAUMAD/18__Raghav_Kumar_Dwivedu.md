Namaste Bhaskarji
I assume you are just joking. Because I have not seen any advaitin claim
that objects like chairs and tables have a greater degree of reality than
Ganesha etc. If you have any quotation by anyone to the effect that "chairs
etc have vyAvahArika sattA while Ganesha does not being purely imaginary or
derived and hence not available for any transactions ", kindly quote it.

 Because in Brahma sutras devatAdhikaraNam, bhAShyakAra has asserted that
devatAs are vigrahavantaH and that in earlier times some riShis etc could
directly communicate with them .

Maybe you are implying DSV, but even there chairs etc., are of the same
sattA as devatAs.

Om
Raghav

I got stuck on "Ganesha is derived". The question which bothers me is as
follows - whether Ganesha is a vyavaharik satya like you and me, like this
table and chair.. or whether He is a derived abstract concept.

>  We the advaitins not ready to accept and attribute even the vyAharArika
satyatvaM to Lord Ganesha while happily accepting the vyAvahArika satyatva
of even jada vastu-s like chairs and tables ðŸ˜Š   Ganesha, vishNu, shambhu,
devi sUrya panchAyatana devata-s are mere derived abstract concepts ðŸ˜Š
thanks to nireeshwara Advaita vedAnta ðŸ˜Š  Kindly note I am not making this
statement after seeing your doubt, I am stating this after seeing the
confirmation that "Ganesha is mere derived abstract concept ".  Now the
doubt is who wrote mahAbhArata ?? did vyAsa dictate this to mere abstract
nonexistent entity called ganesha or the ganesha who wrote mahAbhArata is
some other ganesha who has atleast vyAvahArika reality   ðŸ˜Š

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
