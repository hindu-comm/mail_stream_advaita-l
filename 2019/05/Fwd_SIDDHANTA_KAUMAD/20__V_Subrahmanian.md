The 'HarimeeDe stotram' or 'Hari stuti' is a work admitted by all as that
of Shankaracharya.  It is full of Vedanta vichara. It also has a
commentary. Here Shankara says:
https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_vishhnu/harimIDestotra.html?lang=sa


ब्रह्मा विष्णू रुद्रहुताशौ रविचन्द्राविन्द्रो वायुर्यम इतीत्थं *परिकल्प्य* ।
एकं सन्तं यं बहुधाहुर्मतिभेदात् तं संसारध्वान्तविनाशं हरिमीडे ॥ १८॥


[Having 'parikalpya' (one can give whichever translation that pleases
one for this word) 'brahmaa, vishnu, rudra, agni, surya, chandra,
indra, vayu, yama - people say variously according to their own
intellects - that which is One. That One Hari who is the destroyer of
samsara, I bow to.]  Thus, when the names are parikalpita, it follows
that the forms are also so.

Shankara has cited the mantra 'ekam sat vipraah bahudhaa vadanti' and
similar ones in the bhashyas including the Vishnu sahasra nama.
