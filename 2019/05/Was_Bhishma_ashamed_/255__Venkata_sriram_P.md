Namaste,

Read the document.  By using the words 'lajjAvAn' 'neecheekruta' etc., 
they wanted to prove the supremacy of Vishnu during those days when bhArata 
was in turmoil and was being molested by Moghuls and later by Britishers. 

By creating the rift among Hindu brothers with their hate literature, 
they are unaware of how much poison they have injected among the hindu brothers.  

Hindus denigrating Siva / Vishnu are no less than today,s Owaisi, Mamata Banerjee, 
Kamal Hasan and other sickular right-wing liberals !

Surprisingly, the hindu fanatics under the seize of bigotry are encouraging and 
studying in mutts with 'extreme maDi & shaucha' ...

With regards, 
Sriram
