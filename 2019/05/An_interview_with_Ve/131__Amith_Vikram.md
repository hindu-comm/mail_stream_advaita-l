Namaste,

It's been a while since I was active on this forum although I was reading
some of the emails. I am starting a new project on Vedas/Vedanta and as
part of it, I am collecting the views and opinions on several key issues
from various learned Vedantins. This is the first ever such interview and I
am very grateful for Venkatji for agreeing for this chat.
