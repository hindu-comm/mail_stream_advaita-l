Namaste, Swami Vishveshwarabanda Bharati, peethadhipati (1977-82) of the
Sri Shivaganga Sringeri Shankara Matha, has composed a Suprabhata of
Bhagavatpada Sri Shankaracharya. It has been melliflously rendered by
Vidwan Sri S Shankar, who incidentally resides in Shankarapuram, Bangalore!
Here is a link to it.

Kindly give it wide publicity. Let it reverberate from all temples having
His sannidhi.
