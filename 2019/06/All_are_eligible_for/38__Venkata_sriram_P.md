Namaste,

लक्षणया वृत्त्या "आयुर्वैघृतं" इति मन्त्रे आयुः एव घृतम्। तद्वत् ज्ञानमेव मोक्षः ॥

Scholars have multiplied the technical terms to add more confusion to the advaita-siddhanta ! 

rgs,
sriram

 A beautiful article &
 message from Parama Shraddheya Ramsukhdas Ji Maharaj
 :

 > But
 according to some all are eligible for jnana but NOT mOksha
 as the mOksha can happen ONLY after taking sannyasa
 (sannyasa here means Ashrama sannyasa not mere vairAgya).
 BTW, jnana is not mOksha as per some prakaraNa. 

 Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
 bhaskar
