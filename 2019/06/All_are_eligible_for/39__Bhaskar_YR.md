praNAms Sri Sriram prabhuji

Very apt quote indeed.  jnana ( complete annihilation of avidyA) itself mOksha.  jnana and then mOksha and between jnana and mOksha there is something (sannyasa as vidhi for example) needs to be done etc.  is bAshya bAhira if we understand shankara's clarification in samanvayAdhikaraNa bhAshya :  shrutayaH brahmavidyA AnantaraM mOkshaM darshayantyaH madhye kAryAntaraM vArayanti, by giving the example of rishi vAmadeva bhAshyakAra clarifies : brahma darshana sarvAtma bhAvayOrmadhye kartavyAtaravAraNAya udAhAryaM...yathA 'tishTan gAyatee' ti taishTati - gAyatyOrmadhye tatkartukaM kAryAntaraM nAsteeti gamyate.  Though standing and singing appears two different actions, there is no gap 'as such' in this action, when avidyA is completely eradicated jnana dawns on its own and jnana prApti is itself mOksha (jnAnam eva mOkshaH).  Interval between these two (samyak jnana and mOksha) and sannyasa as vidhi for mOksha  is quite untenable in shankara bhAshya at least in this bhAshya vAkya üòä 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
