Yes, though it is popularly known as vidyaraNyakruta, the author, in his poetic unwanted flow, in this work holds vairAgya murthy bhagavatpAda's 'jeevana charitra' in a bad light especially when narrating these episodes. Anyway, when the tattva as Advaita is more important and significant in our sAdhana that is amply available in AchArya pratipAdita prasthAna traya this trifle anecdotes can easily be ignored in these socalled traditionally approved biographies. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
