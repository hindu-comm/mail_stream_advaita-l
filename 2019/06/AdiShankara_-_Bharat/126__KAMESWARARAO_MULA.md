Bhaskar Ji,          We used to have shankara's biography in my grand father's house as a reference book. After his passing, we lost many treasures from his in-house library. But as per your suggestion, I down loaded the madhaveyam of Shankara-Dig-Vijayam by vidyaranya, translated by swami tapsyananda and read the conversation of mandana mishra & adi shankara.
Adi shankara's meeting with Vyasa & his arguments with mandana on jnana/Karma-kanda was described very nicely from 70-104 pages, whose link is given below for any body to make use of it. Thanks for the right advise and infact there is no discussion of ubhaya-bharati devi with shankara on kama sastra in that.

Once gain many thanks for your reply & nice advise.

The debate between shankara and maNdana is about karma and jnana

 

Bhaskar Ji,

          Will it be possible to get the official script for the actual conversation on Karma kanda/Jnana (not the post advaitin commentaries in books), any links, pls provide. I am keen to read those.

 

It seems Adi shankara was invited for Shraddha Bhiksha for a ceremony where as shankara insists for Vada Bhiksha (Knowledge battle with vada/prativada) with mandana misra.

As I said earlier, to ascertain the credibility of all these episodes we have the source in biographies only written by various authors who are obviously not unanimous in narrating these episodesâ€¦there are vyAsAchaleeya, chidvilaaseeya, mAdhaveeya, kUshmAnda shankara Vijaya (or shankara kathAmruta sAra) etc. etc. So, accurate account of this debate with maNdana and queries by bhArati not available as it varies from one author to another. But as per per mAdhaveeya there are some agenda for this debate (pratijnA vAkya-s) before debate and there are some questions and answers to this. Please see mAdhaveeya for further details. And with regard to bhAratiâ€™s queries about kAma kalA shAstra you may find the â€˜usefulâ€™ information in mAdhaveeya itself or vAtsyAyana kAma sUtra ðŸ˜Š And after parakAya pravesha we can see ratilOlatva in the king and his experience of brahmAnanda with the â€˜saMparkaâ€™ of queens etc. and justification to all these questionable attitude of Acharya in the kingâ€™s body as narrated by authors nothing but mere poetic freedom and imagination IMO. Anyway, hope you have any one of the biographies with you to study shankara digvijaya in detailðŸ˜Š 

 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

bhaskar
