Mahamahopadhyaya Pullela Sriramachandrudu Garu didn't approve such cock & bull stories regarding Bhagavatpada. 

Acharya is known to us only thru His magnificent literature and if we can take any single work of His and
study deeply and contemplate, we can cross the ocean of samsAra.  His composition on Dakshinamurthy is
enough !!
