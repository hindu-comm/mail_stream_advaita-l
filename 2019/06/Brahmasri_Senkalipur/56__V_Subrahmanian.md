*Sengalipuram Anantarama Dikshitar* (Tamil
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language>: சேங்காலிபுரம் அனந்தராம
தீட்சிதர்; 2 August 1903 – 30 October 1969) was a Śrauti
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Arauta> scholar and also was a great
exponent of the art of *upanyasas* (discourses) on various subjects in
Hinduism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism>. Born in the Thanjavur
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanjavur> district as the second son to Sri
Subramanya Dikshithar, boy Anantharaman was initiated into the learning of
the Vedas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas> under his father Subramanya
Dikshithar who was also known as chinna Muthannaval brother of Sengalipuram
Vaidhyanatha Dikshithar or Periya Muthannaval. Paruthiyur Krishna Sastri
<https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paruthiyur_Krishna_Sastri&action=edit&redlink=1>
was
the first guru for Anantharama Dikshithar. He first had his Aksharabyasam
from Krishna Sastri at Muthannavals’s Gurukulam. Then he further studied
other Shastras <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shastras> and Vedangas
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedangas> from eminent scholars of repute,
astrology from Kadalangudi Natesa Sastrigal who also was his father in law.

On the divine wishes and direction of Sri Guruvayurappan, the presiding
deity, He has performed many Srimadh Bhagavatha Saptaahams at Guruvayur.
The Sringeri Sankaracharya Sri Abhinava Vidya Teertha Swamigal too eagerly
participated in the Navaaham conducted at Tiruprayar Sri Rama Temple at
Kerala, as this was performed as ordered by the presiding deity, Sri Rama
Himself. In fact, every one was thrilled to know the personal involvement
of the Lord in the Navaaham. His discourse attracted tens of thousands of
apt listeners, which was unusual till then.

The available portions of the recordings of His discourses rendered in
public were brought out in cassettes as per the gracious directions of Sri
Kanchi Paramacharya. Now, the contents of the tapes have been processed
using software and the result is a far improved audio quality. The improved
contents are brought now in both the forms of Compact Discs and also of
cassettes. The proceeds are to be used for Sri Adhishtaanam of Sri
Deekshithar who attained Sidhi on 30-10-1969 (in the month of Thula,
Krishna Sashti tithi) after taking Sanyasa on 21-10-1969,within 10 days.
Daily poojas are performed at Sri Adhishtaanam at Chinnathirupathi, Salem
Town. His divine presence is still felt there where He answers the prayers
of devotees.
Sengalipuram <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengalipuram> village in Tamil
Nadu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu> is famous for its
*Deekshitars* (Smarta <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smarta> Hindus
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus> who have performed many Yajnas
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yajnas>).
