Hi All,

Please find below PDF which contains the life of Nayanars.

http://www.dlshq.org/download/nayanar.pdf

Ramana Maharishi and Maha Periyava have said in their books that it is very
important to read the Life of Nayanars to learn how they have gained Shiva
Bhakti which lead them to Advaita Mukti.
