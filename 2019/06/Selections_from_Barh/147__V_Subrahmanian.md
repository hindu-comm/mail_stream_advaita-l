Selections from Barhaspatya sutram

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barhaspatya_sutras

The *Bārhaspatya-sūtras* (a patronymic of Brhaspati), also *Lokāyata*
("materialistic",
"atheistic") *sutras* is the foundational text of the Cārvāka
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C4%81rv%C4%81ka> school of materialist (
nastika <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nastika>) philosophy.
Probably dating to the final centuries BC (the Mauryan period
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya>),[*citation needed
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>*] this text has
been lost, and is known only from fragmentary quotations.

This short selection highlights some of the vedic/religious practices that
prevailed in the very ancient times:
