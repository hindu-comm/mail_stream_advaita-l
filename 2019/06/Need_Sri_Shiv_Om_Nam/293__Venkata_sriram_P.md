Just find out those major shiva temples that give dollar with panchakshari yantra
inscribed in it.  Generally, these dollars are given as prasad if we enrol for abhishekam
/ puja tickets.  Also, quite a few puja shops near Kalahasti, Jambukeshwaram, Kanchipuram,
Chidambaram, Kumbakonam, Tanjavur etc. have these yantras displayed for sale.  These can be 
purchased and can be energised from a known purohita of your family by placing in a local 
shiva temple.

It is a pentagon shaped star with praNava (Om) at bindu sthAna (middle) and na, ma, shi, va, ya 
inscribed inside the 5 triangles respective.  

Some astrologers do offer this online after payment is done online but this is not suggestible. 

Always, one's guru's advice should be followed and consulted before going for these yantras. Of course, 
panchakshari is a 'siddha-mantra' and one need not follow the rules of 'siddha-ruNa-ari' chakras 
before getting initiated. 

If you happen to be an andhraite, then I think you are aware of Annavaram Devasthanam of East Godavari
District near Kakinada which has the famous 'Rama-sahita-Satyanarayana Swamy Temple'.  Everyday, mass 
satyanarayana vratams are conducted.  If you purchase the ticket of Rs.500/-, they would conduct 'satyanarayana
vratam' and along with prasadam, they give a bronze dollar with image of veera venkata satyanarayana swamy 
on one side and panchakshari yantra (a pentagon with panchakshari bijas inscribed) at the back side of dollar
This can either be kept in puja room or can be worshipped with rudra mantras and shiva ashtottaram.

rgs,
sriram
