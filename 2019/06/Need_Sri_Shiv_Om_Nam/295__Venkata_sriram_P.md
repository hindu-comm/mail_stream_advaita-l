Mantras fall under 3 categories viz., siddha, ruNa, ari. If the sadhaka wants to get initiated, his guru inspects the mantra sthAna in horoscope of sadhaka. If mantra balam is there, he will prepare a chakra with the help of sadhaka's name and mantra bijas. If the mantra falls in siddha chakra category, then it implies that it is benefic in nature and can be initiated without inhibitions. It is a safe mantra that would never misfire and yield misfortune. If the mantra falls in ruNa category, it implies that the mantra was chanted by the person in previous birth and there is devata-ruNa-anubandha. Hence, can be initiated on an auspicious day. If the mantra falls in 3rd category ie., ari (enemy), then it implies that that particular mantra is malefic in nature and would cause harm to upasaka. So, there are a few mantras prescribed in mantra shastra that are 'siddha' and panchakshari is on among them
