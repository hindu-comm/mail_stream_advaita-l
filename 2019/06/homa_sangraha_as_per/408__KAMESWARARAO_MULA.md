Thank you so much and this is what I exactly need, although I am used to all these procedures & learnt in my childhood, but i need the script here to perform ayush homam, navagrahahomam through agnimukham by the local pandit. I will get it done by him.

many thanks once again

regards
Kameswara

 Namaste,

Here is the link. The mantras are in ITRANS version. Useful for reference.
However, prior learning of the same under guru is mandatory before referring this book.
