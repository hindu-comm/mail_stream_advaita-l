Namaste,

My opinion:

As per the formula 'तु हि च स्म ह वै पादपूरणे', the words tu, hi, cha, sma, ha, vai - are used as fillers of gaps in
shloka. Not of much importance and we need not split our hair to derive it's meanings.

So, the meaning is clear that Brahma extracted Rg, Yajus, Sama from Agni, Vayu & Aditya for 
yajna-siddhi.

rgs,
sriram
