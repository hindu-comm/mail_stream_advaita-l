Dear Sir,
A more grammatical explanation can be exercised per my concern. ’Tu'
denotes immutable compound which translates to 'But', in this case it
defines another attribute of the ’Trayi vidya' which is different from the
sacrificial attribute of the vedas (Atharban). Question is- How did the
lord churn out the Atharvan since there is no fourth object to extort from?
What is fourth object?
Best Regards,
Shashwata Chowdhury.
