Namaste

I had sent this message to the yahoo groups alone. So resending here....

"Is a PDF of the vAsudeva-mananam available somewhere in sanskrit or
English ?

I have seen the laghu-vasudeva-mananam of the Ramakrishna Math but no trace
of the unabridged original vAsudeva-mananam? "

Thank you
Om

Raghav
