Dear friends,HOW TO REALIZE ONE’S TRUE SVARUPA?

UrdhvamUlO^vAk SAKa

This is That eternal aSvattha Tree with its root above and branches below. That root, indeed, is called the Bright; that is Brahman, and that alone is the Immortal. In that all worlds are contained, and none can pass beyond. This, verily, is That.

Where is that Brahman and what is that Brahman?
sarvagM hyEtadbrahma
ayamAtmA brahma|| Mandukya : Mantra 2

What is Atma?
Sri Sankara says: AtmA hi nAma svarUpam ||

Hence Atman / Brahman is HERE and NOW.

Now the question arises: How can I know 
Brahman or my trues varUpa?
Sri Shankara writes :kathaM tu tadbrahma samyagviditaM Bavati? ItyEvamarthamAha –
pratibOdhaviditaM mata-
MamRutatvaM hi vindatE |
AtmanA vindatE vIryaM
vidyayA vindatE^mRutam|| Kena:2-4
Sri Shankara’s commentary on the above mantra has 
to be studied at the feet of a Guru 
who knows what he is teaching.
Awareness is your true nature, your core. 
You are the light of awareness illuminating all that is, 
including the thoughts parading .YOU ARE AWARE BEFORE A THOUGHT APPEARS. 
YOU ARE AWARE WHEN A THOUGHT PASSES BY. 
YOU ARE AWARE WHEN A THOUGHT DISAPPEARS. 

Thoughts come and go, but you remain.
You are the inextinguishable flame of awareness
 in which
 all is revealed. 

Dear Sincere mumukshus, in the above compilation of mantras from Upanishads and commentaries of Sri Sankara , 
 the right royal, simple and direct way 
has been shown by Sruti and AcArya.If anyone, who is desirous of sadyOmukti, 
studies, understands, assimilates and cognizes 
the fact revealed by this mantra within himself by 
himself, his purpose of taking this 
precious humanbirth is fulfilled.NOTHING MORE IS LEFT
SuBamastu

With respectful namaskars,
Sreenivasa Murthy
