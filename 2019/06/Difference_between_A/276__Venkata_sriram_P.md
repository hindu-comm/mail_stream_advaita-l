Dear Praveen-ji,

..
I am not sure I understand your question/ objection as AkAsha and avakAsha
have different meanings
.............

The Ramakrishna Mutt Edition edited in English by Swami Sharvananda has this given below.  Hence, the 
confusion.

.............
So, this Akasha is at once Avakasha or Space and Ether or the Primary Matter whose
only quality is considered to be Sound
...........

Any layman reading the above sentence would get confused with the thinking that Akasha & Avakasha are different
entities altogether !!

rgs,
sriram
