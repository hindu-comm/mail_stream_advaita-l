I am not sure I understand your question/ objection as AkAsha and avakAsha
have different meanings as space and occasion/ opportunity, respectively.
avakAshapradAtA AkAshaH means that AkAsha is that which provides an
occasion/ opportunity for everything else, meaning it becomes an adhikaraNa
(so to say) for everything else to manifest. That is why AkAsha is the
first to manifest.
