Thank you for a beautiful excerpt from Brahmashri Mani Dravid Shastriji's
pATha. I don't think there is much to discuss as it brings out the
similarity and difference, both. avakSha is that adhikaraNa in the form of
empty space for others to manifest; one who provides that is called as
AkAsha. Its a saMjnA. I was taking the rUdhyartha as occasion/ opportunity,
but it can be yaugika as well so: AkAsha is that which provides itself as
empty space (to others for manifestation).
