The confusion arises owing to reading english commentaries.

आकाशो नाम शब्दगुणः अवकाशकरो मूर्तद्रव्याणाम् - 

Akasha is that which has 'sound' as attribute and 
makes way for things having a form.  

अवकाशः - to make space

You are getting confused with terminologies आकाशः and आकाशः .

Also, you are going in a single direction without even thinking of alternate
meanings of आकाशः as per the sampradAya.  

आ (समन्तात्) काशते (प्रकाशते) इति आकाशः and hence, आत्मा is compared with आकाशः

My 2 cents...

sriram
