A wonderful talk series on Sri Vidyaranya. A lot of information on a
variety of subjects is woven in this talk series. He makes references to
the Panchadashi to give an example to Vidyaranya's mastery in various
fields such as art and dance.

The rest of the talks are available in the above page as play list.
 Everyone knowing Kannada must listen to these talks.

warm regards
subbu
