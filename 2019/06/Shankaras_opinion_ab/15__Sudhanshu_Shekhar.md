Hari Om Bhaskar Prabhu ji,

1. //BTW, justification like this cannot be said in the case of
vyAkhyAnakAra-s works  as they have differed drastically from mUla
bhAshya.// ☺️ Are you sure ? What appears as "drastic difference" to you in
the case of vyakhyanakara may be mere "elaboration" of the crisp mula in
view of others.

2. The basic problem is the fitting in of vidvat-sanyasa in the sequence
mentioned in Gita Bhashya 5.12. Even jnana-nishtha is pre-Moksha.
Sarva-karma-sanyasa is even prior to jnana-nishtha. Bhashykara clearly
mentions the Yajnavalkya episode as akhyayika and not history. In any case,
if we were to take vidvat-sanyasa as sarva-karma-sanyasa, then it will be
pre-Moksha and only Brahmana-male will be eligible therefor.

3. Moksha would result into natural renunciation of karma. Since everyone
is eligible to Moksha, everyone will be eligible for this type of
renunciation. Based on this logic, I used the term post-Moksha-sanyasa
though the term is never used by Bhashyakara in this fashion.

Sudhanshu
