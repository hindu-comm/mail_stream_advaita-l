Namaste,

There are some people who are always rooting for a fight, perhaps because
of their background of training from outside Advaita-Vedanta and from
within their own school of AV. They are those hit and run cases that hit by
calling others names. The worst of the opportunists say that "since you two
are hitting each other below the belt, I am right"! Its no matter whether
such is just a tactic used in tarka without any commitment to it. Mind you,
Bhagavan Sureshvaracharya himself does so in Naishkarmyasiddhi with
Purvamimamsakas. Thankfully, they give some respect to him who though
proven to differ from self-acclaimed shuddha-shAnkara-prakriyA is not
differing at all, like *other* vyAkhyAnakAras! The same Vartikakara, who I
hope is an expert to them like their very own guru/s, said that
prakriyAbheda is just that, nothing more, by:
यया यया भवेत् पुंसां व्युत्पत्तिः प्रत्यगात्मनि ।
सा सैव प्रक्रियेह स्यात् साध्वी सा चानवस्थिता॥
but that is not useful to them as it doesn't help paint others yellow with
their jaundiced eye. The complex that "my guru is the guru, others are a
bunch of jokers anyway" is an attitude-problem. Be it so. Oh, wait, a
smiley would help tone down the seriousness as its all very funny! :-)
