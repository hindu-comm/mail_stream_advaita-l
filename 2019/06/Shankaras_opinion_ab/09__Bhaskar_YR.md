Thus, it appears prima facie that Sureshvara's view is in disharmony with Bhashya with respect to eligibility of Kshatriya and Vaishya for sanyasa.

Yes, if I remember right Sri SSS also observes this somewhere.  And in Geeta shankara says though janaka is eligible for karma sannyasa, he continued his karma for the sake of lOka kalyANa/saMgraha (janakAdayaH tattva vidOpi....karma sannyasa prAptepi etc.) .  Here it appears that here bhAshyakAra did not have any problem in accepting the sanyAsAdhikAra to kshatriya.  And in mundaka also shankara clarifies why there is special emphasis on brAhmaNa shabda as he has the vishesha adhikAra to renounce everything and engage himself in brahmavidyA.  But in bruhadAraNyaka bhAshyakAra concluding that na hi kshatriyavaishyayOH pArivrAjya pratipattirasti. Denying the pArivrAjya sannyasa to kshatriya and Vaishya.  Perhaps bhAshyakAra talking about different types of  sannyasa in these contexts.
