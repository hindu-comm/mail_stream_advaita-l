Post: Such ideas as quoted by Sri Subramanian and Sri Sudhanshu Shekarare no longer valid in this century.They were ok for the period when they were made.
Atma is not the essence of Brahmins only.
They are still valid in this century also. They are ok now, what is the problem in that, I didn't understand the issue.
If some one wants to validate any concept/issue take a re-brith i.e Dwija/Brahmana and resolve the issue, who is stopping? No one can stop any body in reaching the Brahman with their atma-nivedana.
The Best examples for this, See Sir John Woodroof, being the british (Foreigner, for get about his caste who he is) did all the mantra purascharana , practised all the vidya mantra with dedication. He was asked to remove is complete hair by mundane and Oriya pandit force him to put Sikha also when he was entering into the path of shakti sadhana.
So it doesn't come by birth or caste, Mother will take care of all the devotees who wants to reach her/Brahman.
Sri Guru Padaravindarpana MastuKameswara

 V Subramanian ji,

Vartika 3.5.191

इमामवस्थां संप्राप्य सर्वो ब्राह्मण उच्यते।
ब्राह्मण्यं गौणमन्यत्र पूर्वभूमिषु नाञ्जसा।।

There are other shlokas prior and after this shloka with similar intent.
Appears in disharmony with view of Acharya. Hence the request.

Sudhanshu.
