In 4.5.15, न हि क्षत्त्रियवैश्ययोः पारिव्राज्यप्रतिपत्तिरस्ति, BhAShyakAra is referring to which kind of PArivrAjya?

Thanks for the exact reference prabhuji.  When I said for different varNa-s different types of saNyAsAdhikAra, I myself was not sure just guessing to reconcile this seemingly contradictory stand by bhAshyakAra.  In the case of janaka etc., bhAshyakAra talking about the vidvat sannyasa that which yAgnAvalkya followed.  Being a king, janaka was supposed  to do the lOka saMgraha thence he continued to be a king even after jnana (tattva vidOpi) and even though he is eligible for karma sannyasa ( karma saNyAse prAptepi).  So, I reckon it is about vidvat sannyasa.  I think vidvat sannyasa has been denied for the kshatriya and Vaishya in the above bhAshya vAkya as they have something (like lOka saMgraha) to accomplish not as a vidhi.  And vividisha sannyasa (Ashrama sveekaara for jnana/mOksha) could be the vidhi for all trivarNa-s and all three varNa-s eligible for karma sannyasa when they have the necessary vairAgya to renounce everything for the sake of jnana / mOksha.  Sureshwara might have granted adhikAra to this type of sannyasa in vArtika.  All these are just my guessing to bridge the gap between vArtika and bhAshya.  But still I am not sure of myself.  I am open for correction in this regard.  Sri SSS left it to scholars to clarify why this difference in bhAshya & vArtika.  While on the subject, Sri SSS also observes that there is glaring difference between sUtra bhAshya and br. bhAshya with regard to some point of view taken on the same topic by the bhAshyakAra.  Details I donot remember, it is there in his introduction to sUtra bhAshya in Kannada.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
