Now let's say P1 attains moksha while P2 does not. The factum of attainment of Moksha by P1 does nothing to B1. It exists as before. However, the viparita-pratyaya occurring earlier in B1 are now replaced by samyak-pratyaya. B2 as before keeps on having viparita-pratyaya and never gets samyak-pratyaya.

Now, the simple question is -- whether B1 will ever get raga-dvesha-etc viparita-pratyaya in the post-Moksha period. Let us leave all nirupadhika, "in the eyes of ajnani", uapdhi-parichchinna-rupa etc. These are technical terms and they often do not convey the intention. Simple question is -- whether B1 will have raga-dvesha-etc viparita-pratyaya in the post-Moksha period.


Ã˜     A short and clear answer without any technical terms, is : YES due to avidyA lesha since bhAshyakAra himself admits continuation of vAng manaH kAya even after samyak jnana, jnAni is also subject to rAga-dveshAdi vipareeta prtyaya.  The example given here is â€˜digbhrAntaâ€™.  So say some.  With regard to P1â€™s relationship with B1 bhAshyakAra says : api cha mithyAjnAnapuraHsarOyamAtmanaH budhypAdi saMbandhaH, na cha mithyAjnAnasya samyaKjnAnAdanyatra nivruttirasteetyataH yAvad brahmAtmatAnavabhOdhastAvadayaM buddyupAdhi saMbandhaH na shyAmati.  sUtra bhAshya in the second chapter.

Anyway, I am afraid to discuss these things once again as all traditional guns already started firing at me ðŸ˜Š

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
