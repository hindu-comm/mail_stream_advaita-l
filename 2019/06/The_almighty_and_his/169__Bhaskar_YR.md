Today in whatsapp some one shared me this injunction while taking the Arati.  The varAhamUrthy saying this to his wife :

Artikya grahaNakAle ekahastena yOjayet, yadi hasta dvayenaiva mama drOhi na shaMshayaH.

Whenever I read these type of injunctions with regard to rituals and celestial beings (devaru in general ) rigidity  I wonder is this really the words of all compassionate god or some 'fault-finder'!!?? Take the above example, varAha murthy saying to his wife  ' if you take Arati with both hands,  then that's the end of it, immediately he becomes culprit to me (mama drOhi) and his further clarification/insistence  'there is no doubt' in it (na saMshayaH).  Is this really an unpardonable sin to take the Arati with both hands??  Is this so serious crime to face the wrath of the almighty??  Take another example of satyanArAyaNa vrata / pooja, the most dangerous god in that vrate katha,  if you don't do the pooja after doing the saMkalpa or even if you do the pooja but forgot to take teertha, prasAda,  he will make you suffer like anything...Do we have to understand these statements /anecdotes as it is at its face value ??  Please share your thoughts.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
