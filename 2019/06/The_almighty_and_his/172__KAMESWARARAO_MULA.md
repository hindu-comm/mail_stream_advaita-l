 Dear Sir,
 Today in whatsapp some one shared me this injunction while taking the Arati.

Although there are may advantages & uses of whataapp groups, Now a days I observed the trend is going in a business/Passing of Profit making issues oriented approaches. For elders, it is ok, acceptable as people have viveka, so no issue, but the teens are getting fully spoiled by this whatsapp technology as some one forwarded me a funny message that you have stop any thing for the daily activity or life, but you shouldn't stop seeing whatsapp irrespective of one crore important activities of life leaving behind. This is something absurd.

Regarding Arati: I have some thing to contribute which I put down here.

Then comming to our actual interest of discussion:

Take another example of satyanArAyaNa vrata / pooja, the most dangerous god in that vrate katha, if you don't do the pooja after doing the saMkalpa or even if you do the pooja but forgot to take teertha, prasAda, he will make you suffer like anything...Do we have to understand these statements /anecdotes as it is at its face value ?? Please share your thoughts.

The same question were asked by me to our family priest who is the authority in Satyanarayana Vrata Kadha in Konaseema of AndhraPradesh. He said to me that, the story of the Katha was based on one of the real thing happened in some one's life (as Kadha says) in those days and The mail role of the Kadha is to keep faith in the people who have inclination for self-realization. The business person in the story says that he will do kadha after he gets profit and he gots profit, after that he promised god that he will perform kadha after his daughters marriage , like this so he never does it unless he full submerged in the personal life. In another story, some one for gets to take 'Prasada' there by falling in traps, as some one throws the theertha into dustbin which causes danger to him.

He said to me that the main purpose of Puja/Katha is the 'Bhava' of the godliness and submersing into the attributes of self-realization other wise these stories will remain as anecdotes only.

Arati is the major part of any festival/Puja and it is a daily activity of the people from northern India The last stabza of arati from Bholenath which goes like this:
Trigun Swami ji Ki Aarti Jo Koi Nar Gave,
Kahat Shivanand Swami Manvanchhit Phal Pave.Om Jai Shiv Omkara
 Swami Shivananda says that, “He who recites this Arti to the Lord of the three gunas-sattva, rajas and tamas - attains fulfillment of his heart’s desire”. O great Lord Omkaara, may you rid me of my afflictions
According to Swami Sivananda,
The tower of a temple represents Brahmarandhra. Balipitha represents the navel or Manipura Chakra. Nandi represents Ajna Chakra. Dhvajastambha represents Sushumna Nadi which runs from Muladhara to Brahmarandhra.
Dig-devata dwells in the ears, Vayu in the skin, Sun in the eyes, Varuna in the tongue, Asvins in the nose, Vishnu in the feet, Indra in the hands, Agni in the speech, Prajapati in the generative organ, Yama in the anus, Sutratman in the Prana, Hiranyagarbha in Antahkarana, Chandra in mind, Brahma in the intellect, Rudra in egoism, Siva in Chitta, Sarasvati in the end of the tongue, Parvati in Anahata Chakra, Lakshmi in Manipura Chakra, Ganesa in Muladhara and Satchidananda Brahman in Brahmarandhra at the crown of the head.
Satya, Ahimsa, Tapas, mercy, love, self-restraint, contentment, forgiveness, Jnana, equal vision, peace are the real flowers of Puja. All the Nadas are the waters for Abhisheka. The virtuous actions are the offering of incense. Vedanta is Pitambar. Jnana and Yoga are the Kundalas. Tapas and meditation are the lights. Japa is Chamara. Anahata is the music. Kirtan is umbrella. Pranayama is the fan.
Tattvas are the attendants of the Lord. Jnana-Sakti is the Devi. Agama is the commander. The eight Siddhis are the door-keepers of the Lord. Turiya is the Bhasma. Veda is the bull or Nandi. Kalyana Gunas represent the Trident in the hand. Panchakshara is the holy thread. Suddha Jiva is the ornament. The Vrittis are the Pujopakaranas. The Panchabhutas and the five Tanmatras are the Rudrakshamalas of Lord Siva. Tiger skin represents Ahankara.
Kriya-Sakti and virtuous actions are Dhupa or incense for the Lord. Chit-Sakti which produces knowledge is also Dhupa. Offering of the ego and the mind at the lotus-feet of the Lord is real Naivedya. Just as camphor melts and becomes one with the fire, so also the mind of a sage melts and the individual soul gets merged in the Supreme Soul. This is real Karpura Arati.

Today in whatsapp some one shared me this injunction while taking the Arati. The varAhamUrthy saying this to his wife :

Artikya grahaNakAle ekahastena yOjayet, yadi hasta dvayenaiva mama drOhi na shaMshayaH.

Whenever I read these type of injunctions with regard to rituals and celestial beings (devaru in general ) rigidity I wonder is this really the words of all compassionate god or some 'fault-finder'!!?? Take the above example, varAha murthy saying to his wife ' if you take Arati with both hands, then that's the end of it, immediately he becomes culprit to me (mama drOhi) and his further clarification/insistence 'there is no doubt' in it (na saMshayaH). Is this really an unpardonable sin to take the Arati with both hands?? Is this so serious crime to face the wrath of the almighty?? Take another example of satyanArAyaNa vrata / pooja, the most dangerous god in that vrate katha, if you don't do the pooja after doing the saMkalpa or even if you do the pooja but forgot to take teertha, prasAda, he will make you suffer like anything...Do we have to understand these statements /anecdotes as it is at its face value ?? Please share your thoughts.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
