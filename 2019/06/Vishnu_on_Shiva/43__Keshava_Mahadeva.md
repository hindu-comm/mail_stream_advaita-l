The same has been told in many Puranas, Upanishads and Harivamsha:

*Skanda Purana: Maheshwara Khanda, Arunachala Mahatmya, UTTARARDHA CHAPTER
16 (Description of the Temple of Arunachala by Brahma and Vishnu):*

17. If you had not killed Narhari (Man-lion) by assuming the form of
Sharabha (man-lion-eagle) alone, he would have destroyed the universe like
Hiranyakashipu
18. In the ocean at the end of the Kalpa you were the boat man who dragged
Hari in the forms of Fish, Tortoise, Boar and Man-lion after binding him
with the king of serpents for cords.
19. When the heap of thousand lotuses was short by one, Vishnu concluded
your worship with one of his eyes. O Trident-bearing Lord, you gave him the
discus Sudarshana and satisfied him.

*Harivamsha:*
yatra lebhe harishchakramupAsya bahubhirdinaiH ||3-84-11
puShkaraiH shatapatraishcha netreNa cha jagatpatim |
where hari (viShNu) obtained his chakra after serving the lord of the
universe (shiva) for many days, with blue lotuses and lotuses with hundred
petals and also with his eyes,

*Sharabha Upanishad:*
13. Let there be adoration to that Rudra, who bestowed the disc (chakra) on
Vishnu, who worshipped him by one of his Eyes on his left foot. (When
Vishnu found wanting one lotus flower, he pulled out one of his Eyes,
making offering, completed the Sahasranamarchana).
