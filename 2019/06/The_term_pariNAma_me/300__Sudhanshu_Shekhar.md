V Subramanian ji,

If you know clay, you know all products of clay. But if you know sand, do
you get to know about mirage-water? There is no samshlesha between
mirage-water and sand. There is samshlesha between pot and clay. How is
sarva-vijnAna possible in vidvarta - that is my precise problem.

Sudhanshu.
