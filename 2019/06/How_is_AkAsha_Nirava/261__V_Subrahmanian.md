Most of the above is already admitted. No one has suggested absolute
nityatva of akasha. Even sarvagatatva of akasha is superseded by Atman
since Akasha is only adhyasta in Atman.  The Ratnaprabha observation is
worth pursuing:  Smarta Rahul shared me an image too but since images are
not allowed in this group I am giving only this:

रत्नप्रभाभाष्य ब्रह्मसूत्र २.३.७ ( यावद्विकारं तु विभागो लोकवत् ) में आकाश
कार्यद्रव्य होनेसे उसका निरवयवत्व असिद्ध है (क्योंकि सिद्धान्तमें
कार्यद्रव्यमात्र ही सावयव माना जाता है ) - ऐसा कहा गया ; (सावयव होनेपर भी )
---> आकाश में सर्वमूर्तद्रव्यसंयोगत्व स्वीकार करना अनुचित है क्योंकि तब
आकाशमें वर्षा, वायु, अग्नि आदि के संयोग से भीगना इत्यादि स्वीकार करनारूप
अनर्थप्राप्ति होगी ~ शंकरानंदी टीका , गीता , अध्याय १३, श्लोक २६
यदि रत्नप्रभा की बात माने तो १३.२६ में भाष्यकार द्वारा आकाश को निरवयव कहना
आत्मा का नित्यत्व समझाने हेतु एक लोकप्रसिद्धि का अनुवादमात्र मानना पड़ेगा,
सिद्धान्तवाक्य नहीं ;

But we have not seen Bhashyakara's word anywhere denying niravayatva for
akasha. A Madhva scholar told me some years ago that Madhva accepts akasha
as savayava only but did not give reference where he has said, etc.

The Panchikarana based savayavatva of akasha that I proposed a couple of
days back seems to be endorsed by Ratnaprabha. पञ्चीकरणादस्पर्शत्वमसिद्धम्
