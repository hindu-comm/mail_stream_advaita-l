Another related topic for discussion is: Before PanchikaraNam the elements,
including Akasha, were sukshma bhuta-s, which are not perceptible to the
common sense organs. In Panchikarana, the element Akasha is 'divided' as it
were into to halves first and one half is further divided into
four......This makes Akasha endowed with parts even at the sukshma bhuta
stage.

Are there any texts in Advaita / nyaya / sankhya that consider the above?
