Hari Om Praveen ji, Venkataraghavan ji, V Subramanian ji,

I discussed the issue with Smartha Rahul ji also. He made a reference to
Ratnaprabha on Brahma Sutra 2.3.7 which holds the sAvayatva of AkAsha on
the basis of its being kArya-dravya, which is pretty logical.

Further I saw in BS 2.3.7 itself the explanation by BhAshyakAra
- यच्चोक्तमेतत् — शब्दाच्चेति — तत्रामृतत्वश्रुतिस्तावद्वियति ‘ अमृता
दिवौकसः’ इतिवद्द्रष्टव्या ; उत्पत्तिप्रलययोरुपपादितत्वात् ; ‘*
आकाशवत्सर्वगतश्च नित्यः’ (शत. ब्रा. १० । ६ । ३ । २)
इत्यपि प्रसिद्धमहत्त्वेनाकाशेनोपमानं क्रियते निरतिशयमहत्त्वाय, न
आकाशसमत्वाय* — यथा ‘ इषुरिव सविता धावति’ इति क्षिप्रगतित्वायोच्यते, न
इषुतुल्यगतित्वाय — तद्वत्

Now, I think this explanation is decisive. It is not that AkAsha is
sarva-gata and nitya actually. Shruti use the well-known-sarvagatatva and
nityatva of AkAsha to indicate the niratishaya-sarvagatatva and nityatva of
Brahman. The Shruti is not to indicate equality with AkAsha. Similarly, the
usage of word Amrita for AkAsha (Antariksha)  in 2.3.3
Brihadaranyakopanishad is equated with the amritatva of devatAs and not
actual amritatva which is possible only for Brahman.

So, this reference also explains the niravayavatav of AkAsha in 13.27 and
elsewhere in my opinion. It is not that AkAsha is niravayava actually, on
account of it being a karya-dravya as held by Ratna-Prabha. But the
prasiddha-niravayavatva of Akasha is just used as a simile. It is not the
niratishaya-niravayavatva of Brahman.

Sudhanshu.
