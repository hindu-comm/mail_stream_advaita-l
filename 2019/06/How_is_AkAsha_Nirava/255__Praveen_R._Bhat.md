avayava doesn't mean a part in the sense of one half of AkAsha, else one
quarter of brahman would make even brahman an avayavi. It means a limb
which is separate than the whole, or upAdAnakAraNa part which has to be
necessarily different from the kArya whole. In this case, parts of
sUkShmAkAsha have not come together to make whole sUkShmAkAsha and nor are
they different from sUkShmAkAsha.
