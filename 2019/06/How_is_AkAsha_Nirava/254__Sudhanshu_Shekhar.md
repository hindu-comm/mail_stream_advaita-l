Valid question V Subramanian ji. I don't have knowledge regarding this
issue of division of nirvayava stuff being discussed anywhere.

If we restrict to BhAshya, then we don't see such description of
Panchikarana.

That aside, I think BhAshyakAra does not regard trigunAtmakatva as
sAvayavatva. That appears so in 2.1.29 BSB. There as Purvapaksha, He says
-- even though one thinks of PradhAna as sAvayava by taking it to be
trigunAtmaka, still the defect is not rectified etc. So it gives an insight
to His mind. He does not regard trigunAtmakatva as sAvayavatva. Question is
why?

Sudhanshu.
