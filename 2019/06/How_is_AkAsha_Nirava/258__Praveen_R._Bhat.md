Thanks for the Brahmasutra references, Subbuji. Venkataraghavanji has also
quoted the same reference. Overall, one thing is clear that we have
exception seen when it comes to AkASha/Maya/avidyA, as no independent tarka
can be perfect. How so can likely be answered only by mAyayA sarvasya
sambhavAt.

Kind rgds,
