Dear Members,             Worshipping of the different god/godess by visiting number of shrines may give the Chosen Path by getting eternal bliss. There may be different forms of worshipping , but all are interconnected can be integrated into unknown superpower which is formless. The urge and desperation of the seeker to visualise the power in a specific form makes him converted from single entity into the domain of universalism. The concept of Beyond matter can only be explained by matter only. Energy can never be created nor destroyed, but it can be changed from one form to the other form only.
Saint Ramakrishna says The devotion of the worshippers, Sincerity of the Priests, Desperation of the Seekers, Beauty of the image god/godess, Selfless service of the Disciples and all combined together lead to the materialisation of the Metaphysical power. Often people say no stone was untouched and efforts will never go into vain.
If you take the whole universe and it exists from the manifestation of the infinite consciousness and everyone dwells in that. Some people expresses nothingness as God. No path towards eternal bliss is superior than any other and every path has its beauty.
One of my Teacher often says that God Exists in between the Thoughts. He continues to say Suffering exists to the issues which we have Tadmatya Sambandha i.e we are associated with that by knowingly or unknowingly.
