Hi All,

It is very important to get the Darshan of Nandeeshwara on Pradosham before
Lord Shiva.

I am sharing some hymns related to Nandeeshwara where we plead him so that
we can do service to CHANDRASHEKARA SADASHIVA.

*Nandeeshwara Praarthana:*

Nandeeshwara namastubhyam saambaananda pradaayaka
mahaadevasya sevaartham anujnaam dehime prabho |
vedapaadam vishaalaaksham teekshna shrungam mahonnatham
ghantaangale dhaarayantam svarna ratna vibhooshitham
saakshaaddarma tanum devam shivaroopam vrushambhaje ||

Uksham Vishnumayam vishaanakulisham rudra svaroopam mukham
rugvedaadi chatushtayam padayutham, suryendu netra dvayam !
naanaa bhooshana bhooshitam suranutam, vedaantha vedyam varam
andam teerthamayam, sudharma hrudayam sree nandikesham bhaje !!

*NANDEESHWARA NAMASKARA VIDHAANAM:*

Vrushasya vrushanam sprushtvaa eeshwarasyaavalokanam !
shrungamadhye shivam drushtvaa punarjnma na vidyate !!
shrungayor vaamahastasya tarjanyangushtakenyaseth !
andam savye sprushtvaa shrungamadhye shivam yajeth !!

Thanks & Regards
Keshava Mahadeva
