Hi,

Mahaperiyava's Lecture on Shivananada Lahari Verse 61

 *Ankolam nija beeja santhathi rayaskkantho soochika,*


*Sadhvi naija vibhum latha kshithiruham sindhussaridvallabham,Prapnothiha
yadha thadha pasupathe padara sindhu dwaiyam,Chetho vruthi roopethya
thishtathi sada saa bhakthirithyuchyathe.*

Like the real seed progeny reaches for the mother ankola tree,
Like the iron needle reaches for the load stone.
Like the chaste woman reaches for her lord,
Like the tender creeper reaches for near by trees,
Like the river reaches for the sea,
If the spirit of the mind,
Reaches for the lotus feet of Pasupathi,
And stays there always,
Then that state is called devotion.
