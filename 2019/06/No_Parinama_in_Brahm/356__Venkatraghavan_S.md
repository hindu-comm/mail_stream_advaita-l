Sudhanshuji,
Even the explanation that it is an appearance only a provisional one. It is
merely a step to get the student to accept that the world is not real. So
don't take it as siddhAnta. It's only if you believe it is the ultimate
reality will the question "how did the appearance come about in the absence
of change" will arise.

The appearance of the world and the seer who sees that appearance, are also
part of the  world which is being denied.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
