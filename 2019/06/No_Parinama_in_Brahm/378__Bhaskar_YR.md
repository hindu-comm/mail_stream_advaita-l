Appearance has a certain physical process behind it. Some laws of Physics govern it. Hare's horn cannot have even an appearance. Coming about of appearance implies change. Hence, appearance implies change - somewhere, in something. And that militates against changelessness.

This is my problem.

Sorry again for intruding.  Bit free time at office, hence talking too much today ðŸ˜Š  To resolve this problem, vedAnta introduces us â€˜anirvachaneeyatvaâ€™ of mAya.  bhAshyakAra gives foam and water example.  The shakti, the brahmanâ€™s power which cannot be separated from brahman.  Somewhere it has been described as upAdhi of brahman.  This is obviously an index which helps us to recognize the attributeless brahman without affecting it in anyway.  In that case as you observed, mAya would be different from brahman.  If that is the case the changing mAya belong to brahman or it is different from brahman??  To resolve this relationship between change & changeless, we should keep in mind that one does not need any shAstra to explain the directly perceivable effects (kArya) It is necessary to analyze their cause which is changeless / imperceptible and distinctly different.  Here exactly shAstra / bhAshya concedes the anirvachaneeyatva of this changing world / mAya.  sUtra bhAshya : avyaktA hi sA mAyA tattvAnyatvA nirUpaNasya ashakyatvAt.  So, IMHO, you are trying to find an answer explanation  to the concept which is not describable as idamitthaM.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
