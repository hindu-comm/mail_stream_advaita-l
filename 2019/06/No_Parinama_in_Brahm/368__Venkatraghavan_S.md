Praveen ji,
Isn't the pramAta also an aupAdhika entity and mithyA? So nothing other
than Brahman really exists, and that which really exists does not undergo
change?

The problem of change is only possible in vyavahAra. When there is no
vyavahAra in paramArtha what is the need to explain change there?

Regards
Venkatraghavan
