My guruji's favourite shloka of BG by chanting he gets ecstasy and goosebumps:


यावानर्थ उदपाने सर्वतः संप्लुतोदके।
तावान्सर्वेषु वेदेषु ब्राह्मणस्य विजानतः।।2.46।।

One need not study 'n' no. of shastras, books ....take up any one and MEDITATE on that.  The meditation should 
be such that every meaning nay every letter nay every syllable should sink inside with commentary.

Such power is there in Dakshinamurti Stotra of Sankara Bhagavatpada and daily chanting of it 
would bring the grace of Adi Guru of Advaita Parampara Dakshinamurty and the 
essence of scriptures would be revealed by itself 

rgs,
sriram

 Venkata Srirama
 Prabhu,
 On the contrary, my
 observations are after a thorough study of all BhAshyAs by
 Adi Guru on Brahma Sutra, Gita and Upanishads.

 Ring means gold+space. Everything is possible then. Ring can
 be converted

 into stone even. Because now we have two entities and
 different permutation

 and combination are possible.



 However, when there is singular changeless entity, nothing
 is possible.

 Neither vivarta nor pariNAma.

 I think you should read चतुस्सूत्री
 & अध्यासभाष्यं....



 It seems you have directly jumped to study Brahma Sutra
 Shankara Bhashya and his commentaries on Upanishads

 without studying the prakaraNa granthAs and adhyAsa-bhASyaM.




 Hence, the confusion is arising in understanding advaita
 siddhAnta.



 rgs,

 sriram
