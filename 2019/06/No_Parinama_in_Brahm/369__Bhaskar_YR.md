The problem of change is only possible in vyavahAra. When there is no vyavahAra in paramArtha what is the need to explain change there?

praNAms Sri Venktraghavan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Problem does not stop there with this solution (atleast from Sri Sudhanshu's perspective / doubt).  What is vyavahAra when there is absolutely one without second unchanging entity is there??  Is his next question.  The root of all these explanations he is doubting and clarifying is that these words jugglery like vyavahAra - paramArtha, jeeva, jagat, paramAtma etc. etc. are based on change lest these explanations / justification do not arise at all.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
