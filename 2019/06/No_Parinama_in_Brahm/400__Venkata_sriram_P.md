Namaste,
............
Appearance has a certain physical process behind it. Some laws of Physics
govern it.
..............

If you dip iron rod inside the water, the rod "appears" to be bent.

Does it really get bent...No.  It appears to be bent because of the principle called 'Refraction'.

Similarly, is the case with Creation. It is apparent due to 'avidya'.  

Neither the Rod is actually bent nor there is Creation, per se.

rgs,
sriram
