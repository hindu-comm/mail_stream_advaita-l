Venkataraghavan ji,

//4) Creation is only an appearance.
5) Appearances do not exist.//

Appearance has a certain physical process behind it. Some laws of Physics
govern it. Hare's horn cannot have even an appearance. Coming about of
appearance implies change. Hence, appearance implies change - somewhere, in
something. And that militates against changelessness.

This is my problem.
