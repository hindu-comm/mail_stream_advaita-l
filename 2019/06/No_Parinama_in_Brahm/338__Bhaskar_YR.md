I understand this pramANa theory pretty well. However, I am addressing the root of this all. And that root is change and changeless.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Seeing the change in changeless is called adhyAsa (atasmin tadbuddhiH)  realizing the changelessness in change is paramArtha ðŸ˜Š  All these acrobatics is just an upAya to drive home this ultimate point (parama siddhAnta).

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
