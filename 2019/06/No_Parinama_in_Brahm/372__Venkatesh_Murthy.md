Namaste

This topic is simple. Change means something has become another thing after
some Time. A has become B after some time t. Without Time there cannot be
Change. In Science also we learn Rate of Change in Position is Velocity and
so on. If there is No Time there cannot be Rate of Change. This means No
Change. But in this list only we have discussed Time is also Maayaa only.
It is included in Illusion. There is no Time concept in Brahman. There is
no past, no present and no future. Therefore without Time there is no
Change to be measured. No Change can happen.
