Sudhanshuji will have a problem with this too since the question in his
mind, as I see, is that who is that someone who sees the snake? In the
exemplified it has to be brahman as nothing else exists and then he will
question as to this imagination is also a change! This is the same issue
with pUrvapakShis that ask this very thing. devasya svabhAva, etc, are also
unsatisfying as everything has to be via tarka, for which anirvachanIya has
been a blessing. It is so. Why? Why not!

Vichara Sagara deals with the issues in multiple ways and dedicates a
chapter each to various types of adhikArIs. However, IMO, no answer will
satisfy the tarkika via tarka as it is akin to someone who has never left
his country trying to apply all his country's rules and regulations to
another country that he doesn't even know about and thinks that the same
rules should apply. We are being kUpamaNDukas. Another way it is explained
is a person who was blind insists that he wouldn't open his eyes (beyond
tarka) after undergoing eye-surgery (after shravaNa, etc) unless he is
convinced that he will be able to see. He fails to see that he can't see
unless he opens his eyes to even the possibility of seeing! In the
dArShTAntika, insisting that vyAvahArika rules should apply is meaningless,
since there is no rule there at all, nothing other than it exists. This is
the reason why I think Bhagavan Bhashyakara gives a tucCha example under
2.32 kArikA.

Sudhanshuji, I so hope that you are convinced or at the very least move on
beyond asambhava soon, assuming that you think it is asambhava!
