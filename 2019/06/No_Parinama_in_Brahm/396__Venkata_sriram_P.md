Namaste,

When you have "thoroughly" studied, then how come this confusion

............................
However, when there is singular changeless entity, nothing is possible. Neither vivarta nor pariNAma.
................

It is owing to ADHYASA ONLY.  

Not that I am a great scholar here....I have studied only Dakshinamurty Stotra and Bhagavat Gita. 
With my base on Dakshinamurti Stotra, I am able to understand with decent clarity on Advaita.

No offence meant !

 Venkata Srirama
 Prabhu,
 On the contrary, my
 observations are after a thorough study of all BhAshyAs by
 Adi Guru on Brahma Sutra, Gita and Upanishads.

 Ring means gold+space. Everything is possible then. Ring can
 be converted

 into stone even. Because now we have two entities and
 different permutation

 and combination are possible.



 However, when there is singular changeless entity, nothing
 is possible.

 Neither vivarta nor pariNAma.

 I think you should read चतुस्सूत्री
 & अध्यासभाष्यं....



 It seems you have directly jumped to study Brahma Sutra
 Shankara Bhashya and his commentaries on Upanishads

 without studying the prakaraNa granthAs and adhyAsa-bhASyaM.




 Hence, the confusion is arising in understanding advaita
 siddhAnta.



 rgs,

 sriram
