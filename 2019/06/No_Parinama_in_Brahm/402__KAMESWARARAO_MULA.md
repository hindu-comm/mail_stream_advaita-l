It appears to be bent because of the principle called 'Refraction'

No, It is not Refraction as it the iron rod which is a material.

Refraction Principle applies to Light.

In physics, refraction is the change in direction of a wave passing from one medium to another or from a gradual change in the medium. Refraction of light is the most commonly observed phenomenon, but other waves such as sound waves and water waves also experience refraction. How much a wave is refracted is determined by the change in wave speed and the initial direction of wave propagation relative to the direction of change in speed.

If you dip iron rod inside the water, the rod "appears" to be bent.

Does it really get bent...No. It appears to be bent because of the principle called 'Refraction'.

Similarly, is the case with Creation. It is apparent due to 'avidya'.

Neither the Rod is actually bent nor there is Creation, per se.
