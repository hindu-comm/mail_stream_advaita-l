Venkataraghavan ji,

What do you mean by "it is denied"? If the appearance and the seer is
hare's horn, then it is not possible because hare's horn cannot have even
an appearance. If the appearance and seer are mithyA i.e.
sat-asat-vilakshaNa, then it implies change. There is no appearance without
involving change. Just by saying "it is denied" in siddhAnta, the objection
of existence of change is not obviated.

I am surprised that people do not have this problem. May be I am really a
manda-dhi with lot of impurity of mind.

Sudhanshu.
