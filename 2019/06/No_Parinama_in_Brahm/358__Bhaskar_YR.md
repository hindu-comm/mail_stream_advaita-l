I am surprised that people do not have this problem. May be I am really a manda-dhi with lot of impurity of mind.

If you consider yourself a maNda dhi then take my name also with yours ðŸ˜Š But, instead of hovering over the problem, I have pacified myself by resorting to anirvachaneeya ðŸ˜Š If we are seeing something say â€˜changeâ€™ then definitely we have some problem in our vision because shruti says when jnAni realizes his secondless nature what can he see, hear think??  etc.  : yatra tvasya sarvamAtmaivAbhUt tatkena kaM pashyetâ€¦tatkena kaM shruNuyAt tatkena kaM manveethA ?? Donâ€™t you think maNdAdhikAri like me somehow should find the answer to all these paradoxes and satisfy with it?? ðŸ˜Š  For me, your doubts are â€˜settled issuesâ€™ but donâ€™t ask me how logical it is!!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
