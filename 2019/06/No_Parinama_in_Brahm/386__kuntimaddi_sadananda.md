//None can succeed in proving the rope undergoes a change when
someone imagines a snake in it.//

It is not a question of rope undergoing change or not. This whole process
of someone+imagining+rope+as+snake involves change and that is impossible
if Brahman is sole singular changeless infinite entity.

Sudhanshuji - PraNAms
You are right. The missing link here - from Brahman point there is no creation what so ever - end of the story.
The projection requires a mind. To see the snake where the rope is - The projecting mind is involved. The mind has to be created first for projection. This is what is called anonya ashraya dosha. It is similar to seed first or tree first. Hence Shankara says - anirvachaneeyam - inexplicable.
Hence mind that is projecting is not created - it is part of the anaadi system. Hence creation-sustenance-and dissolution is a cycle without a beginning.
What need to be recognized is the whole cycle itself is within the vyavahaara reference.
>From Brahman - it is one without a second - neither ropes nor snakes.
Unless one appreciates these two reference states, the essence will not be understood.
Hence the declaration - shraddhavaan labhate jnaanam - says, Krishna.and shraddhaa is defined by Shankara as - shaastrasya guru vaakyasya satya budhyaavadhaarnaa - faith in the scriptuers and in the teaching of these scriptures by the Guru are essence and for the person who has that shraddha only knowledge takes place as per Krishna's above statement.
Hari Om!Sadananda


Praveenji,

No. It does not help. Hare's horn cannot be perceived by barren woman's
son. If we equate our perception of world with this, then that is obviously
incorrect. It does not require any Shastra.

Sudhanshu.
