Bhaskar Prabhu,

KAranatva implies change. It is irreconcilable with changelessness. So
KAranatva has to be adhyAropita in Brahman whether it is nimitta kAranatva
or upAdAna KAranatva. adhyAropita implies another entity whose properties
are adhyAropita in Brahman. Whether that "other" is avidyA in samapradAya
or MAyA in SSS's view. If that other is really other, infiniteness is
compromised. If that other is Ananya (through shakti-shaktimata), then
nishkriyatva is compromised. Only if that other is hare's horn and not even
mithya i.e. sat-asat-vilaksaNa that the nishkriyatva and infiniteness are
upheld.

I understand this pramANa theory pretty well. However, I am addressing the
root of this all. And that root is change and changeless.

Sudhanshu.
