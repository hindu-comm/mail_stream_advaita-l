Sudhanshu ji,

"Denied" means it does not exist. I would like to draw your attention to
the fact that by "mithyA", what is meant is the absence of the thing in the
locus of its appearance. Thus, both asat and mithyA denote the absence of
things, the only difference between them is that the former does not appear
and the latter does. That is all.

However, such a mithyAtva (ie absence) applies not only to the object that
is mithyA, but to the object's appearance too. This is so because the
grounds for the mithyAtva of the object (drishyatva) applies equally to the
mithyAtva of appearance - both the vastu and its pratIti are known (I know
the pot. I know that I know the pot), and therefore mithyA - absent.

You may argue that appearance involves change, but that change is in the
seer, not in Brahman. That is why in the mANDUkya kArika, gauDapAdAchArya
says:

‡§â‡§≠‡•á ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§¶‡•É‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á ‡§§‡•á ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§§‡§¶‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä‡§§‡§ø ‡§®‡•ã‡§ö‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡•§

Both (the world and the mind) are mutually dependent objects of perception.
If you ask whether each exists independently, the answer is no. There is no
independent proof of either's existence, because the knowledge of one is
simply based on the knowledge of the other.

‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§¨‡•ã‡§ß‡•á‡§® ‡§® ‡§∏‡§ô‡•ç‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡§Ø‡§¶‡§æ ‡•§

When the mind does not report duality on account of the clear knowledge of
the self, the mind ceases to be - for in the absence of the objects of
cognition, cognitions cease.

Shankaracharya says ‡§® ‡§π‡§ø ‡§ò‡§ü‡§Æ‡§§‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ñ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§ò‡§ü‡•ã ‡§ó‡•É‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á, ‡§®‡§æ‡§™‡§ø ‡§ò‡§ü‡§Ç

‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§Ø‡§ø‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§≠‡§ø‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§É ‡•• It is not possible to determine that the pot
exists, without a pot-cognition. However, the pot-cognition cannot exist
without the pot's existence. There is thus no way to distinguish between
the cognition and is object.

Thus the world and its appearance (cognition), are both mutually dependent,
neither of them real. The appearance of the world (and thus change, which
is the basis of appearance), is merely a cognition which is as unreal as
the world, the object of the cognition. Thus such a change is not in
Brahman, but in the unreal mind / the world.

Then why do we talk of anirvachanIyatva? Because when we begin the journey
in advaita, we take the support of logic as guided by shruti, and from such
a perspective, the description of the world as neither real nor unreal is a
useful stepping stone to the ultimate conclusion that the world is totally
non-existent. This is the meaning that the shruti would like to lead us to.
As vidyAraNya svAmi has said in the panchadashi:

‡§§‡•Å‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ö‡§®‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ö ‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§µ‡•Ä ‡§ö‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡•å ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ß‡§æ ‡•§
‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡•á‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§≠‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§¨‡•ã‡§ß‡•à‡§É ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•å‡§§‡§Ø‡•å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§≤‡•å‡§ï‡§ø‡§ï‡•à‡§É ‡••

The objects of cognition and mAya are spoken of in three ways - absolutely
non-existent, indescribable and real, from shruti, logic and the worldly
standpoints.

Venkatraghavan
