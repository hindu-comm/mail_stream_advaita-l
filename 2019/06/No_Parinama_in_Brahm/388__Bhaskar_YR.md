PraNAms Sri Sudhanshu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Let us go to the root of vyavahArika, pAramArthika, projection, anAditva, frame of reference etc - and that root thing is change. Everything is reduced to change and changeless.

>  Have you checked the bruhadAraNyaka bhAshya ??  I checked it it is in 3.5.1 as I earlier mentioned.  The bhAshyakAra exactly addresses your issue here :  nAma rUpa upAdhi astitve 'ekemevAdviteeyaM neha nAnAsti kiMchana iti shrutayOH virudhyeran iti chet??  Na, parihrutatvAt mrudAdi drushtAntaischa...Please read this bhAshya bhAga fully to understand how brahman can be changeless despite there is change, bhAshyakAra clarifies how there is a difference between svarUpa drushti / upAdhi drushti.  Only the shapeless / changeless gold can change into ring, bangle etc.  is it not?? Only the mrut sAmAnya (the changeless) can appear as mrut vishesha like pinda, ghata etc. ( just like all colousr are there in plain white ) For that matter, if you donâ€™t have the change (nAma rUpa) you will not be able to understand / realize the 'changeless' (prajnAna ghana) svarUpa behind it.  bhAshyakAra exactly says this.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
