Namaste Sudhanshu ji,
They are objects of perception to each other. shAnkara bhAshya to kArika
4.67 - जीवचित्ते उभे चित्तचैत्त्ये ते *अन्योन्यदृश्ये** इतरेतरगम्ये* ।
जीवादिविषयापेक्षं हि चित्तं नाम भवति । चित्तापेक्षं हि जीवादि दृश्यम् ।
अतस्ते अन्योन्यदृश्ये ।

"The fact of their being interdependent does not remove the implication of
change unless you say that hare's horn is an appearance to barren woman's
son. If you are saying that, then I am ok." Yes, that is what it amounts
to. One is jnAna adhyAsa, the other is artha adhyAsa. The sum total of
jnAna adhyAsa is the mind, the sum total of artha adhyAsa is the world.

"If that appearance is to some imaginary seer, that imaginary seer implies
a change by virtue of precedent imagination." It is a case of नैसर्गिकोऽयं
लोकव्यवहारः; the imaginary seer arises only because / when the imaginary
seen arises and vice versa.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
