The way I see it is that the entity is not aupAdhika as the only entity
there is is brahman; its pramAtRtva is mithyA. This is superimposed from
the kAryaprapancha which doesn't exist from pAramArthika. It is not only
not a pramAtR, but not even a sAkShi, as there is no sAkShya.

Undoubtedly so.

I am not explaining change, but I am showing the difficulty of the
pUrvapakShI. If it is said to be an imagination, he will ask whose
imagination? If you say of the imagined pramAtA in vyavahAra, he will ask
who imagined the pramAtA and the vyavahAra. It is endless questioning.
Therefore, from paramArtha, everything else is not mithyA, there is nothing
else; its tucCha, which alone is a resolution. Then some will ask as to how
is vyavahAra possible then? Its not. That is why a jnAnI's experience is
that he is now free but he was always free, never bound.
