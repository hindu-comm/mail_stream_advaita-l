Sudhanshuji,
If seeing is the basis of something going on - Seeing does not confer
reality to the going on, nor does it reveal its reality. One could have
simply imagined it / been mistaken.

I'm merely pointing the direction for you to follow, why don't you give it
some thought and come back with you find. I'd rather not have a one line
conversation on the list.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
