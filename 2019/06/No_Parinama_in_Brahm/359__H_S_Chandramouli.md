Namaste.

Perhaps it may be useful to understand what the Shruti conveys by the term
**svaprakAsha**. This is something not accessible to logic. Afterall all
sAdhnAs only lead to remove the veiling of this. logic to some extent may
be applicable in this sphere only.

Just a suggestion. May help in resolving the issue.
