praNAms Sri Sudhanshu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

In bruhadAraNyaka,  bhAshyakAra explains the question if the nAma rUpa upAdhi (limited adjuncts) are existing how can descriptions like : brahman is ekamevAdviteeya neha nAnAsti kiMchana etc. would match ??  Here bhAshyakAra has given mrudghata drushtAnta and shukti rajata example as well.  Dear Sri Subbu prabhuji or Sri Venkatraghavan prabhuji would it be possible to fish out that reference please.  (3.5.1 in br.up. ??? not sure.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
