Bhaskerji -PraNAms.
Gold remains as gold during the incidental transformation of a ring into a bangle - is it not?The statement - yatova imaani bhuutani jaayante ... where ornaments are bhuutani.
Brahman remains as substratum while the transformation at jeeva jagat takes place. Laya and pralaya etc arise all with Brahman as the substantive.
Hari Om!Sadananda

Interesting statement. Can we imagine pariNAma of the ring into a bangle without GOLD in it?? If no, then what is the role of Gold in this pariNAma i.e. ring into bangle ??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
