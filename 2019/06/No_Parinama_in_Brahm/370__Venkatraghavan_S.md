Bhaskar ji
These explanations are only made because there are questions asking to
explain vyavahAra. An erroneous notion of existence presupposes all of
them. Take that away, there is neither change, nor entities whose existence
is based on that change.

That is why my first answer in this topic a few days back was, why do you
think something is going on?

Venkatraghavan
