Dear Sir,       Kabir says " The love line is very narrow and cannot contain two".The state of observation os never passive or receptive, instead of that it is always goal oriented. Just like a tiger stalking its preened the observing mind seeks an outcome. There is no need of witness when you observe a particular issue very closely or scan it up to the extent you can.
  On the contrary witnessing is passive and being a witness you are not involved & not a participant to the issue and more over we should not have no choice except witnessing and nothing will interfere in this scenario. Where as observer has many things to do.
   Humility of the person creates nothingness at its pinnacle. This vacuum /void state within you reflects the inner core consciousness without imposing anything on others. In that state mind is no longer witnessing the activities and it is the soul which is witnessing the mind-conciouness.
A Compassionate Hridaya contain nothing in it but a vacuum attracts the Nature's grace and by virtue of it gains so many noble qualities and indeed it is the Sant Kabirs's Message to all of man kind.Source: Speaking Tree, Author: Kamesh D Patel

The line by line English subtitles help imbibe the meaning.
