Namaste Praveen Ji,

Reg  <<Very well quoted. Whenever in the context of A (anything), E
(example) is
brought in as an example, to establish B (brahman, although nirguNa) via
guNa of E, the guNas of B and E are not exactly same. It is just that guNa
of B is contrasted with guNa of A via that of E, since E is well-known
(like A, unlike B) and easily contrasted with A. AkAshavat niravayaH,
AkAshavat sUkShmaH, AkAshavat ekaH, kUTavat nityaH, etc, are so, as
niravayavatva, saukShmya, aikya and nityatva of brahma is not the same as
of those in the examples >>,

Thank you very much for a very succinct explanation of the position. I
couldn’t have done better or as well. It has spared me the botheration of
having to explain the quote.

As a matter of fact, it is a very well established and accepted rule. But
somehow it appears to be overlooked fairly often leading to
doubts,confusion and even misunderstanding. Needless to say,  I am no
exception to it either.

 Thanks once again,

Regards
