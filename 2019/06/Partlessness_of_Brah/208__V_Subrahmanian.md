In response to the above last paragraph I have this to say:
Maya/Avidya/akasha will fit the first condition: absence of vyaya owing to
being niravayava. We have not heard of Maya/avidya/akasha undergoing the
bhaava vikara-s but they are admitted to have naasha finally.  Akasha
during every pralaya and the other two at the dawn of knowledge/videha
kaivalya.  This is a case of  swarUpeNa apakshaya (vyaya, naasha).

[There is the mention of increase/decrease of avidya in the Bhashya. But
that is about the avidya kaarya, manifestation of avidya, and not the mula
avidya. Same with maya.]

I can't understand this: //being nirguNa and yet it can have vyaya
swabhAvatah //

Only Atman/Brahman can be nirguna and there is no way there is vyaya
svabhavatah. Not also from an external force there can be vyaya to Atman.

Apart from Atman/Brahman there is no entity that can be nirguna.
