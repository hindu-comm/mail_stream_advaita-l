Hari Om,

Brahman is held as anAdi and niravayava. In Gita 13.32, BhashhakAra
says -- यद्धि
आदिमत् तत् स्वेन आत्मना व्येति अयं तु अनादित्वात् निरवयव इति कृत्वा न
व्येति।

So the logic for being avyaya is being niravayava which in turn is by
virtue of being anAdi. So anAditva => niravayavatva => avyayatva.

Now question arises regarding MAyA or avidyA. What are they? They are also
held to be anAdi. (AnAdi avidyA trigunAtmikA parA). So they should also be
niravayava and hence avyaya. But is that so? They certainly are destroyed.
Aren't they?

Or take for instance GitA BhAshya 13.26 आकाशवत् निरवयवत्वात् . Should this
imply that AkAsha is also avyaya?

Regards.
Sudhanshu.
