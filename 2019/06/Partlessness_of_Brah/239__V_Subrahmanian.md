Also, Bhagavatpada's work/s on Yoga sutras are also a case in point.

BTW if there is any reference to Guadapadacharya's work on Sankhya karika
in Vachaspati Misra's work, even by a remote alluding, we may give credence
to the popular belief.  Also, there is an 'uttara gita bhashya' attributed
to Gaudapadacharya. This book is available in archive.org.
