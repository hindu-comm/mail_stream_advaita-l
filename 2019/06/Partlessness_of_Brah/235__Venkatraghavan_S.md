Namaste sir,

pUrva mImAmsa is a philosophical system developed in ancient India for the
interpretation of vedic sentences, systematized in sUtra form by jaimini
maharishi.
nyAya is another Indian philosophical system which played a very important
role in the development of logic and epistemology, systematized by gautama
maharishi. Both mImAmsa and nyAya are one of the six Astika darSana-s of
India.

What I had said was that both philosophical systems accept the existence of
the Atma and that it has attributes (guNa-s).

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
