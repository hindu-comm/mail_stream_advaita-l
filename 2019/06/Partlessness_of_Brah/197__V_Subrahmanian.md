We can also look at the situation thus: Maya, though anaadi, is nitya. How,
it is pariNAmi nitya as opposed to Brahman which is anAdi and kUTastha
nitya. The logic of Bhagavatpada should be taken with the rider as
explained in respect of Maya.

The statement in BGB 13.26 (not 13.32 as specified by you above) is:

कः पुनः अयं क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोः संयोगः अभिप्रेतः ? न तावत् रज्ज्वेव घटस्य
अवयवसंश्लेषद्वारकः सम्बन्धविशेषः संयोगः क्षेत्रेण क्षेत्रज्ञस्य सम्भवति,
*आकाशवत् **निरवयवत्वात्* ।

Here the comparison is only limited to the possibility/impossibility of
samyoga sambandha, physical contact between two objects. Since Akasha is
niravayava, there cannot be a contact with akasha by any object that is
saavayava. The same with atman. That is the intended meaning of the bhashya.
