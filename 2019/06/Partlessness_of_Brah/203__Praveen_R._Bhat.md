I am saying  anAditva=>niravayatva=>avyayatva is really niravayatva=>
anAditva=>avyayatva (partless --> based on context,
birthless/causeless-->changeless) as from Shankaranandi. As for avidyA, I
think it is same as Maya, being upAdAnakAraNa, there is vyaya.

This is also clear in the case of AkAsha, which is आदिमत्, which cannot be
so, if the above sequence of hetus you read is right since it is also
niravaya.

Kind rgds,
