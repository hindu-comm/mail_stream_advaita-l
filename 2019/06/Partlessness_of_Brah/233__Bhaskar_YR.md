gauDapAda in his *sAnkhya kArikA bhAShya*, uses the term "*aguNa*" for the puruSha, but the meaning is the same as the term nirguNa, ie one where the triguNa-s are absent. Now, it is not certain whether the author of this bhAShya is the same gauDapAda as the author of the mANDUkya kArika-s.

Just a curious question at the risk of digression from the main topic being discussed here.  Is this sAnkhya kArika bhAshya written by  Acharya (Sri gaudapAda (??) from Advaita sampradaya?? Is yes, as we know, pradhAna malla sAnkhya is  most of the times pUrvapaxi to Advaita. (paramataM apratishiddham anumatam bhavati...but quite a rare occasion is it not??)   If the bhAshya is written to this kArika by some Advaita sampradaya Acharya  then it must be with one of the following agendas : To defend and explain the kArika-s in line with sAnkhya school of thought or refute it from vedAnta perspective or trying to explain the sAnkhya theory in line with vedAnta.  What was  the intention of sAnkhya kArika bhAshya author here??  Since I am not familiar with this work, asking this query.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
