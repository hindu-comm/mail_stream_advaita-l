Namaste Sudhanshuji,

I've flipped the reply sequence for continuity and included your next reply
mail here as well...

But so does the anAdi that hetu works directly. If first vikAra is not
possible, then no other or the last vikAra is not possible. Anyway, later,
he states what you say as the corollary! Shankaranandi is using two
meanings for anAdi. It has to be seen which reasoning is given with what.
Strangely enough, Bhashyotkarshadipika is using both. घटादेः आदिमत्वेन
सावयवत्वाद्व्ययः दृष्टः, आत्मनस्तु अनादित्वेन निरवयवत्वाद् अवयवद्वारको
व्ययः न सम्भवति। So I shall drop this line of argument. Thanks for
indulging me.

Oh, yes! Sorry I messed up that line; I didn't think of the consequence
that follows as below:

True, thanks for pointing out the error. Now, lets take your sequence of
niravayavatvAt --> avyaya. It will lead to vyayavatvAt sAvayavatvam.
Doesn't AkAsha have any vyaya?!

Doesn't necessarily look so, as he doesn't use anAditvam at all. I looked
through a couple of other TIkAs. The corollary doesn't seem to be working
for many perhaps because आदि meaning is different for each and in-context.
It needs further study.

... but let that be; lets go to your main contention which is vyaya/avyaya
as I understand, especially in the case of Maya /avidyA ... Anandagiritika
is saying निरवयवत्वात् सावयव-द्वारकस्य व्ययस्याभावेपि स्वभावतो
व्ययस्स्यात्। So vyaya may be possible even if something is niravayava
which I didn't say earlier, but Bhagavan Tikakara does seem to say be it
via pUrvapakSha.
