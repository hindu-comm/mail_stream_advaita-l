Very well quoted. Whenever in the context of A (anything), E (example) is
brought in as an example, to establish B (brahman, although nirguNa) via
guNa of E, the guNas of B and E are not exactly same. It is just that guNa
of B is contrasted with guNa of A via that of E, since E is well-known
(like A, unlike B) and easily contrasted with A. AkAshavat niravayaH,
AkAshavat sUkShmaH, AkAshavat ekaH, kUTavat nityaH, etc, are so, as
niravayavatva, saukShmya, aikya and nityatva of brahma is not the same as
of those in the examples.
