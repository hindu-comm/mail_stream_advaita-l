Namaste Venkataraghavan ji,

//I believe that the third vyaya referred to by the TIkAkAra as svabhAvato
vyaya:, must be admitted for either the pradhAna (if that was accepted as
partless) or to sattva, rajas, tamO guNas (if pradhAna is not accepted as
partless, its guNa-s must be partless in turn).//

//निरवयवत्वादेव सावयवद्वारकस्य निर्गुणत्वाद्गुणद्वारकस्य च व्ययस्याभावेऽपि
स्वभावतो व्ययः स्यादित्याशङ्क्याह -- परमात्मेति.//

Isn't the third vyaya applicable for something which is both niavayava AND
nirguNa. That is why it can be said - OK. You have vyaya-abhAva through
sAvayava-dwAra owing to niravayavatva AND you have vyaya-abhAva through
guNa-dwAra owing to nirguNatva YET you can have swabhAvatah-vyaya. TikAkAra
contemplates this possibility and says that the word ParamAtman is used to
pre-empt this apprehension. By corollary, it means TikAkAra thinks of
something as niravayava AND nirguNa which is not ParamAtman. I cannot think
of any such thing. Neither PrAdhAna nor constituent guNa fit in the
category of nirguNa+niravayava. Interestingly, BhAshya also does not
mention this either in 2.20 or 13.32. It rests content with vyaya-abhAva
through sAvayava-dwAra AND vyaya-abhAva through guNa-dwAra.

//This also addresses the first question why mAya or pradhAna is said to
undergo vyaya when it too is anAdi (causeless) like Brahman. It is
causeless, but its vyaya is intrinsic to it. If the vyaya of mAyA is not
admitted, you are back to square one - how to reconcile that the absolutely
non-changing Brahman is the material cause for the varied, ever-changing
world?//

Since MAyA and PradhAna are not nirguNa, there is no occasion for going to
third vyaya. Their vyaya is very much possible through guNa-dwAra itself.

//Thus the TIkAkAra is referring to the vyaya that can sometimes be natural
to the object, even if the object is niravayava and nirguNa// Can you think
of any such thing?

How I think is as follows:-

the vyaya-abhAva-through-avyava-dwAra is avyayatva-1.
vyaya-abhAva-through-guNa-dwAra is avyayatva-2.

(i) If an object is niravayava but not nirguNa (like AkAshA, MAyA,
PradhAna) - they will have avyayatva-1 but no avayatava-2. So, in totality
there is no avyayatva.

(ii) If an object is not niravayava but NirguNa - No such object exists.

(iii) If an object is not niravayava and not nirguNa - All worldly objects
come in this category. They will neither have avyayatva-1 nor avyayatva-2.

(iv) If an object is niravayava and nirguNa -  It is Brahman which will
have both avyayatva-1 and avyayatva-2. So in totality it will be avyaya.

This is how I have understood which appears to be in line with BhAshya.

*Only problem is - AkAsha, which is triguNAtmaka i.e. comprises three guNa
- how can it be called as niravayava? That is to ask - are not
niravayavatva and saguNatva mutually contradictory. This assumes importance
in view of clear assertion of nirayavatva to AkAsha by BhAshyakAra in
13.27. This also assumes importance in view of the fact that in BSB 2.1.29,
BhAshykAra did not object when opponent said PradhAna to be sAvayava owing
to its triguNAtmakatva. So question to be pondered is - how can niravayatva
of AkAsha and triguNAtmakatva of AkAsha co-exist.*

Praveen ji, V Subramanian ji, Venkataraghavan ji. Pl share your views on
the last para.

Regards.
Sudhanshu.

(निर्गुणत्वात्), nor does it suffer the decay of a thing with attributes
(गुणद्वारकस्य व्ययस्याभावेऽपि), even so, perhaps it suffers the decay which
is intrinsic / natural to it (स्वभावतो व्ययः स्यात्) - To address such a
doubt the bhAShyakAra says (इत्याशङ्क्याह) - The supreme self, etc."

the TIkAkAra meant by svabhAvato vyaya, we can turn to the brahma sUtra
bhAShya.

argues that Brahman being taken as the material cause of the universe
suffers from the defect that either Brahman transforms as a whole, or the
advaitin's position contradicts the Shruti which says that Brahman is
part-less.

defect cited by the opponent equally applies to the pradhAna of the
sAnkhya-s - despite being niravayava, pradhAna undergoes modification.

sAvayava.

because each guNa is in turn partless and serves as the material cause
individually, in cooperation with the other two.

sAnkhya-s too.
