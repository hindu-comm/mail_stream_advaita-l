Praveen ji,

Can we say the above with respect to the mula prakriti maya as it is
admitted to remain over during pralaya as the support/container of all
jivas/beings that existed in the previous cycle, and will be ejected out
from this abode in the next creation cycle? At  pralaya it is called
avyakta.  What I think is meant in the above line cited by you is that it
is applicable to all created entities and not to the very kaaraNam that is
prakriti.

warm regards
subbu
