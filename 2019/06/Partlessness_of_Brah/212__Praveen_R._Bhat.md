Even in this case, as I have left a question in the earlier mail as to the

Thats the only way the bhAShya and many of the TIkAs would make sense,
IMHO.

The reason, I think is to differentiate two types of vyayas as Bhagavan
Tikakara brings out. The avayaya-kRta-vyaya and guNa-kRta-vyaya are one
type and svarUpeNa/svAbhAvika is another.

I'd already covered this in my first response by saying that the shloka is
a logical AND and not a logical OR, but now there are more than two
variables as per the TIkA. However, there is a slight difference in the
interpretation of svena/svarUpeNa in 2.20 and here as in this shloka,
Bhagavan Bhashyakara is showing that both vyayas due to avayava and guNa
are anyena kRta. That is, the svena vyaya here is really by svena
vyayebhyaH or svena guNebhyaH. The TIkA then...

...shows svarUpeNa/ svabhAvataH vyayaH, which is of its own nature. That is
how it is as I present my understanding in conclusion, based on further
thinking on the TIkA and also Subbuji's initial response of treating vyaya
as only nAsha when we come to TIkA.

Precisely so.

svarUpa here is svabhAva, by itself, without its limbs undergoing vyaya or
guNas undergoing vyaya. This is the case of avidyA, mAyA. They, in their
entirety go away, as they don't have any upAdAnakAraNa limbs which have
come together to make them sAvayava nor have they any guNavyaya due to
which they vanish entirely (as in pralaya too there is equilibrium of
guNas), so the vyaya is jnAnena/ vidyayA. In the case of avidyA, by
virodhArthe na~N, its svarUpa/ svabhAva is vidyAvidodhinI avidyA, and in
the case of mAyA, by prapanchabAdha, kAryAnumeyA mAyA is no longer anumeyA.

I think TikAkAra's words should either be taken as:
1) सावयवद्वारकस्य गुणद्वारकस्य च व्ययस्याभावेऽपि स्वभावतो व्ययः
स्यादित्याशङ्क्याह without taking the hetus to lead to something like that
does exist OR
2) निरवयवत्वादेव सावयवद्वारकस्य निर्गुणत्वाद्गुणद्वारकस्य च व्ययस्याभावेऽपि
स्वभावतो व्ययः स्यादित्याशङ्क्याह to show that a doubt may still exist that
such an entity may exist and that is refuted by saying there is no such
entity as only Paramatma is nirguNa and it is a kevalAnvayI example.

PS: The only pUrvapakSha as far as my comfort with the above understanding
goes is if someone counters it by convincingly showing that avidyA's
vidyAvirodha is not svabhAva but guNa. :-)
