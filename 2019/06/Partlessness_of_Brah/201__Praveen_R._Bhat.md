No. I don't think the bhAShya hetu reads the same way as it does for you.
Shankaranandi takes one meaning as न विद्यते आदिमविकारः जनिलक्षणो भावधर्मो
यस्य सोनादिः। निरवयवत्वात् अजः। अजो नित्यः इति श्रुतेः। So the hetu works
better the other way round. Thats why Bhagavan Bhashyakara says निरवयव इति
कृत्वा। So the question should be whether Maya can be taken as निरवयवा।

True.

I didn't say that at all! I said that one hetu in the shloka is not
sufficient. That is anAdi before nirguNa. brahman is both, while Maya is
the former but not the latter. In any case, the type of anAdi that Maya is
isn't the same as that brahman is.
