In support of the above, the term 'aguNa' is found in some texts, a sample
of which are:

अगुणाय नमस्तुभ्यं प्रकृतेः पुरुषात्पर ।। १५ ।  Shiva Puranam
https://sa.wikisource.org/s/wya

Here the reference to the entity as beyond prakriti and purusha as aguna.

Here is a reference from the Srimad Bhagavatam with Sridhari commentary:

https://tinyurl.com/y3yw9ag2

....aguNaaya nirvANasukhArNavAya...

aguna of the verse is explained as the reason for Brahman being infinite
bliss of moksha.

I recall, some time back we had discussed a statement of Sri Vadiraja from
the Yuktimallika or some other text, where he had suggested in the context
of ...sAkshI chetA kevalo nirguNascha...' if the advaiti-intended meaning
is to be found here, the word should have been aguNa and not nirguna.  But
we find even sankhyas have the word aguNa to mean devoid of the three
guNa-s.

It is also to be noted that all attributes whatsoever are due to the
presence of three gunas in entities within creation. In the BG we have the
famous verse:

न तदस्ति पृथिव्यां वा दिवि देवेषु वा पुनः ।
सत्त्वं प्रकृतिजैर्मुक्तं यदेभिः स्यात्त्रिभिर्गुणैः ॥ ४० ॥
 भाष्यम्
<https://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/display/bhashya/Gita?page=18&id=BG_C18_V40_B01&hlBhashya=%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%81#bhashya-BG_C18_V40>

न तत् अस्ति तत् नास्ति पृथिव्यां वा मनुष्यादिषु सत्त्वं प्राणिजातम्
अन्यद्वा अप्राणि, दिवि देवेषु वा पुनः सत्त्वम् , प्रकृतिजैः प्रकृतितः जातैः
एभिः त्रिभिः गुणैः सत्त्वादिभिः मुक्तं परित्यक्तं यत् स्यात् , न तत् अस्ति
इति पूर्वेण सम्बन्धः ॥ ४० ॥

There is no object, sentient or otherwise, which is not endowed with the
three gunas of prakriti.

Thanks.
