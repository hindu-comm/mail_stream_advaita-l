As I said, it is not certain whether it is one and the same gauDapAdAchArya. The author of the sAnkhya kArika bhAShya has clearly commented it from the perspective of sAnkhya. However, that in itself does not rule out the same person authoring two works from different darshana-s, and doing so in a fairly objective and impartial manner. In fact, that is a mark of the quality of a scholar - when they are arguing from one darshana's position, they do so without prejudice and do full justice to the system under consideration.
