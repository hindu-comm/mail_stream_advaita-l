This problem is not there since the term 'sannidhi maatrena'.  There is no
'intent' on the part of NB for anything to happen. Lord Krishna in the Gita
has said 'svabhaavastu pravartate' thereby absolving NB of any action,
volitional or otherwise, in respect to anything connected with creation,
sustenance...bandha moksha.

Even in the very section on Antaryami, in the Br.Up. Shankara uses the term
'sAkshimAtra sAnnidhyena'    ईश्वरसाक्षिमात्रसान्निध्येन  3.7.3. मया
अध्यक्षेण of the Gita also means the same.
