Dear friends,WHAT AM " I "? This is the question 
which will be in the mind of 
a sincere student of Vedanta.The answer for the above vital question is :
The uncreated , unborn, lightof awareness iswhat I am.

That is thebasis substratum, andcontainer of all experiences.

Theworld, senses, body, mind, waking,dreaming, sleeping,

knowledge, lackof knowledge, consciousness, 

unconsciousness– whatever can beframed as some 

kind of experience—these are allappearances in this 

changeless realityof my being.

I amprior to thosethings and yet Icontain them all.

No experienceis separate andapart from whatI am.

UNQUOTE.
Is it not the message of the Upanishads?
Allof usshould cognize this within ourselves by ourselves
so that we can be krutArthas.
Withrespectful namaskars,SreenivasaMurthy.
