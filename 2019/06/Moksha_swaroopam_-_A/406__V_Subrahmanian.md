Dear Praveen ji,

Dvaitins cited this Chandogya 8.12.3 mantra स तत्र पर्येति जक्षत्क्रीडन्
रममाणः स्त्रीभिर्वा यानैर्वा ज्ञातिभिर्वा...

which means 'the mukta enjoys bhogas such as eating, merry making, enjoying
with women, vehicles, relatives, etc..'

This they quote as pramana for 1.There being bhoga in moksha, 2.There being
multiplicity in moksha 3.There being gender differences in moksha.

Shankara Bhagavatpada has concluded that this mantra is arthavada show that
there is no duhkha in moksha.

For taratamya in moksha ananda the ananda meemamsa mantras are shown.

Vishishtadvaitins also cite such Taittiriya mantras for bheda in moksha.  I
had posted here a talk in Sanskrit by an aged scholar of that school that
cites such mantras.

regards
subbu
