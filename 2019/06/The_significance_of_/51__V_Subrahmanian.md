In the Upadesa Saram, Bhagavan Ramana has said the following, which are
actually what is stated in the Upanishads, etc. as precursor of
Self-enquiry:

3. ईश्वरार्पितं नेच्छया कृतम् ।
चित्तशोधकं मुक्तिसाधकम् ॥ ३॥


*īśvarārpitaṃ necchayā kṛtamcitta-śodhakaṃ mukti-sādhakam*

Disinterested action
Surrendered to the Lord
Purifies the mind and points
The way to *moksha*.

4. कायवाङ्मनः कार्यमुत्तमम् ।
पूजनं जपश्चिन्तनं क्रमात् ॥ ४॥


*kāya-vāṅ-manaḥ kāryam-uttamampūjanaṃ japa-ścintanaṃ kramāt*

This is certain:
Worship, praise and meditation,
Being work of body, speech and mind,
Are steps for orderly ascent.

5. जगत ईशधी युक्तसेवनम् ।
अष्टमूर्तिभृद्देवपूजनम् ॥ ५॥


*jagata īśadhī yukta sevanaṃaśṭa-mūrti bhṛd deva-pūjanam*

Ether, fire, air, water, earth,
Sun, moon and living beings
Worship of these,
Regarded all as forms of His,
Is perfect worship of the Lord.

6. उत्तमस्तवादुच्चमन्दतः ।
चित्तजं जपध्यानमुत्तमम् ॥ ६॥


*uttama-stavād-ucca-mandataḥcittajaṃ japa dhyānam uttamam*

Better than hymns of praise
Is repetition of the Name;
Better low-voiced than loud,
But best of all
Is meditation in the mind.

7. आज्यधारया स्रोतसा समम् ।
सरलचिन्तनं विरलतः परम् ॥ ७॥


*ajya-dhāraya srotasā samamsarala cintanaṃ viralataḥ param*

Better than spells of meditation
Is one continuous current,
Steady as a stream,
Or downward flow of oil.

8. भेदभावनात् सोऽहमित्यसौ ।
भावनाऽभिदा पावनी मता ॥ ८॥


*bheda-bhāvanāt so’hamityasaubhavana’bhidā pāvanī matā*

Better than viewing Him as Other,
Indeed the noblest attitude of all,
Is to hold Him as the 'I' within,
The very 'I'.
