What you say is true. This practice will effectively aid  the cultivation
of vairagya. It is like 'out of sight, out of mind', and for the time one
is intensely given to the watching of breath, his mind will not wander
elsewhere. To the extent of warding off unwanted thoughts during the
practice, it will help cultivation of vairagya.
