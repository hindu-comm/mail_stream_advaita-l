Since it is not about vedAnta, I hope I could get the clarification from you about this story.  Well, watching the breathing is the technique adopted to improve our concentration (dhAraNa / ekAgrata), Swamy Vivekananda also suggested this method for improving concentration but not able to understand who it can be an effective tool to get vairAgya?? For getting vairAgya nityAnitya vastu viveka is not required??

What you say is true. This practice will effectively aid  the cultivation of vairagya. It is like 'out of sight, out of mind', and for the time one is intensely given to the watching of breath, his mind will not wander elsewhere. To the extent of warding off unwanted thoughts during the practice, it will help cultivation of vairagya.

regards
subbu
