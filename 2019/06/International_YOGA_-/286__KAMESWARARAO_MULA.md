Dear Members,              We all are going to Celebrate today as International Yoga Day with several yogasana's & discourse on Yoga by experts. one of our major topic of our discussion was on Hatha Yoga.
Yogacharya B.K.S.Iyengar is a legend who has taughtyoga in unique way to all his students. He finds the meaning of the yoga sutrasby his practical search and regular practice of yoga. Thus, he has helped allto experience the wisdom of the yoga sutras. His style of teaching yoga iscalled "Iyengar Yoga" and is now being followed by certified teachersacross the world
Bellur Krishnamachar Sundararajan (BKS) Iyengar wasborn on December 14, 1918. His father Sri Krishnamachar was a school teacherand therefore Guruji has all his father's qualities even at this age. Gurujiwas a victim of malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis in his childhood .At the age of 16, he was introduced to yoga by his GuruSri T. Krishnamacharya. At the age of 18, he was sent to Pune, Maharashtra byhis guru to teach and preach yoga as he knew a little of English. This missedhis opportunity to learn a lot about yoga directly from his guru.Iyengar left his mortal coil on 20th August 2014 at the age of 95years in Pune.
Here are the Liks of Books on Yoga from Iyengar:

 Dear Members,             Most of the people across the globe are going to celebrate 21st June, 2019 (Friday) as International Yoga Day. Yoga allows you to rediscover sense of wholeness in respective lives and fits the broken pieces together. To know our Yoga, One should integrate the Body- Mind-Soul. Krishna tells to Arjuna in Gita to become yogi so that he will come superior of Ascetics and also superior to men of knowledge. A yogi is not attached to anything by duly performing his duty without involving in the issues.
Yoga is skilled action, empowered with wisdom followed by evenness of mind, one can get rid off of good & evil deeds by devoting to Yoga. Gita Tells to all of us is the senses are superior to body, mind is more superior, intellect is still more superior followed by self. Yogic life style brings the balance & harmony between soul, mind & body.
Learned members, pls contribute your views.
