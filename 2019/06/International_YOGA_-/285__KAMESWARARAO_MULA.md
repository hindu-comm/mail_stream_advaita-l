Dear Members,             Most of the people across the globe are going to celebrate 21st June, 2019 (Friday) as International Yoga Day. Yoga allows you to rediscover sense of wholeness in respective lives and fits the broken pieces together. To know our Yoga, One should integrate the Body- Mind-Soul. Krishna tells to Arjuna in Gita to become yogi so that he will come superior of Ascetics and also superior to men of knowledge. A yogi is not attached to anything by duly performing his duty without involving in the issues.
Yoga is skilled action, empowered with wisdom followed by evenness of mind, one can get rid off of good & evil deeds by devoting to Yoga. Gita Tells to all of us is the senses are superior to body, mind is more superior, intellect is still more superior followed by self. Yogic life style brings the balance & harmony between soul, mind & body.
Learned members, pls contribute your views.
