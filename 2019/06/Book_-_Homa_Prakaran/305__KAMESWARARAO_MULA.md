Sir,  I am actually looking for the Kalpam where you start the worshipping of fire god before start the homam, initial puja of the havan kund with the Darbha's/water with mantra's:    
Aditenu manyasva , Anumatenu manaysva, Sarasvatenu manyasva, Deva savitaha Prasva,
    I used to have all these at my hometown, but at my workplace i couldn't find this type of procedure here. If you have it, pls scan it and send it to me.
Thanking you in advancereagardsKameswara

However, this doesn't have the chaturavrutti tarpanam ( I think you are looking for ganapati tarpanam).

This gaNapati chaturAvrutti tarpaNa vidhi is in 'srividyA nityAhnikaM' published by devotees of
Karapatri Swamin. 

rgs,
sriram
