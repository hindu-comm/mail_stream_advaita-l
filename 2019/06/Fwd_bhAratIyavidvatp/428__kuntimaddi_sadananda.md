Among traditional compilations:
Sayanacharya's compilation 'Purusarthasudhanidhi' ed by T Chandrasekharana.
Madras Government Oriental Manuscript Series No. 39 (1955)
Vishnu Bhatta (s/o Ramakrishnabhatta), Purusarthachintamani, published in
1927 by Nirnayasagar Press
Chaturvargasamgraha by Kshemendra, Hamsa Prakashan (Jaipur) published in
2004 with a Hindi translation

Sayana's work is based in the Puranic narratives.

As for modern works:

Chakrabarti, Samiran Chandra. 2000. *The Concept of Purusārthas*. Maharshi
Sandipani Rashtriya Ved Vidya Pratishthan: Ujjain

Danielou, Alain. 1993. *Virtue, Success, Pleasure and Liberation – The Four
Aims of Life in the Tradition of India*. Inner Traditions International.
Rochester (Vermont, USA)

Mehta, J. M. 2006. *Four Objectives of Human Life*. Pustak Mahal: Delhi

Prasad, Rajendra. 2008. A *Conceptual-Analytic Study of Classical Indian
Philosophy of Morals*. Center for Studies in Civilizations (Concept
Publishing Company): New Delhi

Stryker, Rod. 2011. *The Four Desires*. Delacorte Press: New York
Tripathi, Premvallabh. *Purushārtha-Chatushtaya*. Anandakaanana Press:
Varanasi (in Hindi and Sanskrit)

I used the attached compilation that I wrote several years back for my own
teaching purposes. It might not meet the 'scholarly' criteria but serves
its intended pedagogical purpose well.

Regards,

Vishal Agarwal

Pranam to all

Are there any works (ancient or modern) that specifically are on the topic
of पुरुषार्थ?

I see references to पुरुषार्थ in the epics (Ramayana, MBh) and the Puranas,
but has this topic been treated at length by any scholar or commentator in
the past or recently?

Any inputs would be much appreciated.


kind regards
Harsha
