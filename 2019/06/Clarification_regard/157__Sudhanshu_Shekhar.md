Hari Om,

It is evident from the prasthantrayi bhashya that some of the vaidika karma
do require animal killing. However, I wanted to know as to whether there is
any evidence in form of Shastra or Bhashya vakya which enjoins animal
killing in Nitya or Naimittika Karma.

I am aware of Manu Smriti 5.35 regarding animal killing in ShrAddha which
is Naimittika Karma.

Aparte from this, if the learned members are aware of other ShAstra or
BhAshya VAkya which enjoins animal killing in Nitya or Naimittika karma,
then please share.

Regards,
Sudhanshu.
