Namaste,

Where, today, are the bulk of the true spiritual seekers in the world to be
found?

Is the number growing or diminishing? Are there many or are there few?

In the US at least, those few who have real existential curiosity tend to
gravitate towards Buddhism, not Hinduism. American Hindus by and large do
not seem to possess a real longing for Truth â€” at least so it seems to me.
Perhaps I am misinformed.

Is the situation different in India or Europe or elsewhere?

Thoughts?

Akilesh
