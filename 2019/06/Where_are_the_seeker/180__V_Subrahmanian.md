The quantum of seekers may not be visible since we live in the internet
age. Yet in India, you can judge the quantum by viewing the people who
attend classes/talks, etc. of teachers like Swami Paramarthananada, Nochur
Venkataraman, etc. There are other languages like Tamil, Kannada, Telugu
where teachers attract a huge following. There are many such in the North
too in Hindi.  When we see the number of books on Vedanta published by
various institutions, that can also be an indication. Then there are
discussion groups, whatsapp groups, FB, etc. where there are people both
active and silent.

Of course all this has to be seen in the background of Krishna's statement:
it is a rare few that seek and a rarer few that really attain.
