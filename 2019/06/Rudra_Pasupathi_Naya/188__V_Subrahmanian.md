In the AshTottara shata 108 names composed by Jagadguru Sri Bharati Tirtha
swaminah for his Guru Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Swaminah, this one
nAma is:

श्रीशेशभेदरहिताय नमः   [One who has no idea of differentiation between
Sreesha (Vishnu) and Isha (Shiva).

This theme is found consistently in the Acharyas of the tradition
commencing from Shankaracharya. A study of Shankaracharya's works such as
the Vishnu sahasra nama bhashya, the Prapanchasara, etc. specifically and
the prasthana traya bhashya implicitly bring out this theme.
