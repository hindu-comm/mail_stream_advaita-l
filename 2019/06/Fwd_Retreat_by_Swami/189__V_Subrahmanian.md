*A Unique Dialogue from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka-Upaniṣad*

The word “Upaniṣad” means that which eliminates all that is most
undesirable in one’s life —namely fear and sorrow— and leads the spiritual
aspirant to the knowledge of oneself as pūrṇa, whole and free of strife and
limitations. The teaching in the Upaniṣad is always presented in the form
of a special dialogue between the guru and the śiṣya known as saṃvāda,
where the student listens to the teacher with utmost reverence. In this
retreat, we shall be studying in depth a special dialogue between the sages
Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi, which expounds the truth of the self as
limitlessly whole and joyous. Presented within the larger backdrop of
 āśrama-dharma (duties at various stages in one’s life), this timeless
dialogue highlights the purpose of marriage and married life
(gṛhasthāśrama) in the Hindu dharma as a salient preparation for
self-knowledge (ātmajñāna) and renunciation (sannyāsa).
