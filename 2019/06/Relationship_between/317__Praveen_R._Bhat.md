Something that has happened, or not happened, is happening or not,
sometimes or forever, whether little or huge, is all anirvachanIya, even if
we read and read and read and read. What is for sure is it's kAryAnumeya
from the mithyA kArya perspective and from the side that really exists,
there wasn't, isn't, and won't be anything else. There are no other
solutions, and it's definitely not for lack of trying.

Yet, each of us has to undergo this torture till the non-answer becomes a
convincing answer where we can see the beauty of it all and/or the question
drops off as it itself doesn't make sense any more!

In the cosmic joke of things, a huge amount of study is needed to know that
there is no study needed!

As to why, oh, why not! :)
