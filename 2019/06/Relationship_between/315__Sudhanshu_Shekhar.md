Hari Om,

I am not at all concerned with Ramanuja.

//If there is nothing other than Brahman (being infiniteness) by definition
avidya has to rest in Brahman only. If not, we have advaita haani//

I am in complete agreement with you and this is the root of my problem. The
fact that even we are even discussing something called avidya -- does it
not ipso facto indicate -- that something has happened. Something.. no
matter how feeble.. some vibration.. something .. otherwise what is all
this? This is certainly not horns of hare.

And if there is anything, there is contradiction with nishkriyatva of
Brahman.

The fact that there is nothing but Brahman -- and the fact that vyavaharika
is even being discussed -- does it not indicate contradiction?

I have read and read and read and read.. and yet am clueless about this
basic thing.

Sorry to irritate you all with my rant.

Sudhanshu.
