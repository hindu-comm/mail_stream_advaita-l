Hari Om Acharya Sada ji

These are irresistible questions and hence your response is natural.

//Since the substantive of Jeeva-jagat-Iswara is Brahman only, in the final
analysis - the substantive of even avidya is also Brahman.//

on Brahman and avidyA because in the final analysis, only these two are
left.

Sudhanshu.
