Namaste.

 It may be useful to first study and understand how the Shruti deals with
the states of dream and deep sleep (svapna and sushupti) states vis a vis
the individual. The same questions that are now plaguing the student in
respect of Brahman and Jagat may be asked and the answers understood
clearly. It helps in understanding the position in respect of Brahman and
Jagat.
