Hari Om,

What exactly is the relationship between Brahman and avidyA? Brahman is
changeless, activity-less. It cannot be the upAdAna or nimitta in the
primary sense. This is so because kArantva implies change and Brahman being
changeless, there cannot be kAranatva for Brahman.

So, it results that avidyA alone is upadAna and nimitta and the kAranatva
stated for Brahman in Upanishads is adhyAropita. There just cannot be any
other possibility.

However, it leaves us with two distinct entities. Brahman and avidyA. What
is the relationship between them? If one says that two entities, Brahman
and avidyA, will violate advaita then it is answered that avidyA is mithyA
and it is avastu and non-existent and hence advaita is not violated. Should
that mean that the inquiry for relationship between Brahman and avidyA is
meaningless.

Sudhanshu.
