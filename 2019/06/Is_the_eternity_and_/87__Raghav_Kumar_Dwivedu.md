Namaste Sudhanshu j
The usual binary is logic vs. belief . I would suggest that there is also
'reasonable belief' which cannot be categorically put in either category.

For example the belief that there is continuity beyond the death of the
body for the stream of consciousness. Or the law of karma. In which
category would you put them?

Also we could say that they (law of karma etc.) are not falsifiable. They
don't conflict with anything logical. If any thing in the Vedas is (let's
say) found to conflict with reason/logic, then either of two things happens.

 1. We thoroughly reexamine the so-called logical claims of pratyaxa and
anumAna and may find them to be flawed. This usually happens with claims of
science offering reductionist physicalistic analyses of consciousness ,
prANa, manas etc.

2. If needed, suitable reinterpretation may be needed of Vedic sentences
especially where they are dealing with areas of overlap with other
pramANas, taking in to view the shad-lingas etc.

Most of the Vedic sentences deal with matters which are anyway  by
definition beyond the purview of pratyaxa and anumAna.
