Namaste Sudhanshu ji
We had a lot of discussion on this very forum some ten years back I think
on this.

I can summarise some of those points for your reference.

shAstrayonitvAt bhAshya and devatAdhikaraNam bhAShya (शब्द इति चेत्, न, अतः
प्रभवात् प्रत्यक्षानुमानाभ्याम्  1.3.28) in brahmasUtras are very
insightful here.

1. Any pramANa is "self-proving", it does not need another pramANa to
justify its functioning as a pramANa. That the eyes see is self-evident
etc. This is svatah-pramANya-vAda.
2. shabda pramANa is a pramANa. It's validity is based on the nitya
sambandha between shabda (word) and artha (meaning). There is a key mImAmsA
word 'anapexitatvaM' i.e., Vedic sentences independent function as a
pramANa.

In Jaimini Dharma Sutras we have the famous autpattika sutra. Check out
https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2004-February/012666.html

3. Veda is a type of shabda pramANa. Another type of shabda pramANa is Apta
vAkya.
4. That "Veda is a pramANa" is derived from 1. and 2. itself. However the
prAmANyam or "validity" of what is being taught/revealed in the Veda
pramANa needs apauruSheya-nityatvaM to free it from pauruSheya doShas. The
prAmANyam of  Apta vAkya is not free of doShas since it is pauruSheya and
hence subject to future revision.

Hope this helps to get started....

Om
Raghav
