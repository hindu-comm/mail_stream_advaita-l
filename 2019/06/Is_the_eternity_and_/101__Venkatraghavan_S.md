Namaste Bhaskar ji,
One way to link the concepts of svatah prAmANaya and apauruSheyatva is as
follows:

If we accept Vedas have svatah prAmANya, then what they reveal is
intrinsically valid, unless there is some other pramANa that overrules
them.

There is shruti which says vAca vIrUpa nityayA and asya mahato bhUtasya
nisshvasitam rigvedo..etc establishing their nityatva, apauruSheyatva etc.
Thus if we agree with svatah prAmANya vAda, vedas talking of their anAditva
etc is itself the pramANa for it, unless there is another pramANa to
disprove it.

Regards
Venkatraghavan
