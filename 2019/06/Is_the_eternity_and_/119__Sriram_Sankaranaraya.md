Namaskarams,



When we say that the Vedas are apaurusheya, are the words (and syllables) in the veda along with the swaras apaurusheya themselves or is the taatparya apaurusheya?



For example, if Vedas talk about Yagnyavalkya having a conversation in Janaka's court or with Maitreyi, shouldn't it mean that those passages did not exist at the time of Yagnyavalkya? And after Yagnyavalkya had those discussions, the passages arose?



Or if the passages are eternal, then do we consider that Yagnyavalkya, Maitreyi and Janaka mentioned in the vedas are fictional and are mentioned only to give us the knowledge of the Brahman?



Namaskarams

Sriram



P.S. I am an early level student, asking this due to lack of appropriate knowledge. Please pardon any error from me.
