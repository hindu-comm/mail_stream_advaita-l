..........................
It is true that Knowledge is embedded is known to be aporusheyam
........................

Just as we are breathing unconsciously and exhaling the breath
without any external thrust which is called 'reflex action', 
similarly, the 'vedas' are the breath of Ishwara that has a 
certain 'wave-pattern'.  That is the 'Reflex Action' of Ishwara
which even shruti says as "यस्य निश्वसितं वेदाः".  

Hence, अपौरुषेयः.
