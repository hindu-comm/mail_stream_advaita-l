praNAms Sri Sudhanshu Shekar prabhuji

Do you feel that that our belief that Vedas are apaurusheya is reasonable?

>  if you search the archives there was discussion about this topic.  One Sri Omkar Deshpande prabhuji and Sri Chittaranjan Naik discussed this topic comprehensively.  If I am right Sri chitta prabhuji said, pUrva meemAsaka-s have most reasonable logic to prove apaurusheyatva of veda-s.  But it has been well countered by Sri Omkar Deshpande.  I think the discussion is available somewhere in advaitin list.  And dvaitins also very sound logic to defend this apaurusheyatva of veda-s.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
