Hari Om,

we all agree that the basis of Dharma and Brahma-jnana is Vedas alone.
Vedas are the tool to both abhyudaya and nihshreyas. Further, we hold them
to be a pramana. That is the Veda-vakyas are pramana just by virtue of
being a Veda-vakya. The reasons adduced are mainly the apurusheyatva and
eternity of Vedas.

We all have gone through the arguments adduced in support of eternity and
apurusheyatva of Vedas.

My question is -- do these arguments really establish the eternity and
apaurusheyatva of Vedas OR are these our beliefs. That is, whether our
Sanatan Dharma and our sadhana-for-Moksha are essentially belief-driven or
are they based on sound logic.

Regards.
Sudhanshu.
