Hari Om Bhaskar ji

So essentially our Sanatan Dharma and our sadhana is belief-based. However,
one needs to be cautios here:-

1. Conducting one's life on the basis of belief is not per se illogical.
Only when the belief itself is illogical that the consequent conformity
thereto becomes illogical and rejectable. There is nothing illogical about
anAditva and apaurusheyatva of Vedas or for that matter any statement of
Vedas. Hence, though belief-driven, it can be acceptable.

2. If belief itself is illogical, for e.g. eternal happiness despite
duality in heaven -- as some religions hold, then by virtue of being
illogical -- that belief and consequent conduct becomes erroneous.

Therefore, despite being belief-driven, I see Vedas - being the propounder
of Advaita - as the sole means to correct Sadhana.


Regards,
Sudhanshu.
