Hari Om,

Gita Bhashya 6.4 says that a person is called yogArudha when he does not
get attached i.e. does not have the kartavya-buddhi in (a) the the object
of indriyas such as shabda etc (b) karmas i.e. nitya, naimittika, kAmya and
pratishiddha due to absence of purpose and when he is both
sarva-kAma-sanyAsI and sarva-karma-sanyAsI.

This indicates that in order to be called yogArudha, one needs to be a very
high pedestal.

However, in 6.9 bhashaya, Bhagvan Bhashyakara says that he who has sameness
of buddhi with respect to the persons mentioned therein i.e. he who has a
buddhi which is not bothered with ‘who is he, what does he do’ with respect
to the persons mentioned therein, such a person is superior *among all
yogArudhas.*

This indicates that even a person who does not have such feature i.e. even
a person who does not have the said sameness of buddhi with respect to the
persons mentioned therein can be called a yogArudha.

How do you reconcile 6.4 and 6.9 bhashya.

Sudhanshu.
