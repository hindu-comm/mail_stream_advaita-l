Sudhanshuji,

6.4 is an important achievement, but it is not as high as all that. 6.3
after says that the yogaRudha must still employ tranquility as the means to
go further, so clearly the detachment achieved so in 6.4 cannot be
complete. It is a *relative* detachment from purpose, etc. -- that is, it
creates a sufficiently pure mind to be able to go further and pursue
Self-knowledge.

Akilesh
