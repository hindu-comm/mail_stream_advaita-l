Namaste,

Here the sentence "sameness of buddhi" has a deep meaning. 

Wherever the term 'सम​' is used in BG, it should be taken as आत्मा / ब्रह्मा. 
We have references & definitions as समत्वं योग उच्यते / पण्डिताः समदर्शिनः.

So, endowed with व्यसायात्मिकबुद्धिः, one who sees / perceives the same SELF 
in all ....is the best among all the Yogis.  He is none other than आत्मवित् / ब्रह्मवित्

rgs,
sriram
