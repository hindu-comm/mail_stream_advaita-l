Sri Rama Jayam. Sri Gurubhyo namah.

With the anugraham of Sri Sharadamba and Sri Chandramoulishwara and with
the blessings of our Sringeri Jagadgurus Sri. Mahasannidhanam Swamigal and
Sri. Sannidanam Swamigal, we humbly present the first *SHAD VEDANGA
PARICHAYA SAMMELANAM (Conference)* in *Sri Bharati Tirtha Patashala,
Sengottai*, Tamil Nadu on the *24th of March 2019*.

The conference is being headed by the world renowned vedic scholar and
former Principal of Madras Sanskrit College, *Mullaivasal Shri
Krishnamurthy Sastrigal*.

The endeavour is supported by the *South Zone Cultural Center, Tanjavoor,
Ministry of Culture, Govt. of India*.

KEY POINTS:
I. What is this conference about?
*â€œShadangam"* constitutes the 6 angas or "limbs" of the Vedas and are next
in importance to the Vedas themselves. They are among the basic texts of
Hinduism. The 6 angas are:
1. siksha - phoenetics - nose of the Vedapurusha
2. vyAkarana - grammar - mouth of the Vedapurusha
3. Nirukta - etymology/lexicon - ear of the Vedapurusha
4. kalpa - manual of rituals - hand of the Vedapurusha
5. chhandas - metre/prosody - foot of the Vedapurusha
6. jyotisha - astronomy/astrology - eye of the Vedapurusha

Besides these topics, an introduction to mimAnsa and dharmasastram will
also be provided.

II. What are the highlights of this conference?
1. This is the first time such a conference is being arranged in
Tirunelveli Dt in the recent past and certainly the first major conference
arranged in our patashala.
2. The conference will be live webcast and astikas can view it from
throughout the world using a link that will be sent shortly.
3. Vedic pundits from throughout India are expected to participate.

III. What is the purpose of the conference?
According to the inspiring words of Sri. Mahasannidhanam Swamigal,
shadangam is not being taught in most patashalas these days commonly as in
the older days. Under the instruction of Our Holiness Shri. Mahasannidhanam
Swamigal, FOR THE FIRST TIME, we are *re-introducing Shadangam education as
main stream ALONG WITH conventional vedic education (svashAkhai)* for all
*vidyarthis and acharyas* in our patashala. We hope to produce *Shadangam
experts* at the time of graduation of these vidyarthis. The conference
marks the beginning of this endeavor.

IV. When is the conference?
*March 24th 2019, Sunday*

V. How can we participate?
1. Kindly carve out time to view this conference live webcast. Timings and
