Namaste.

Sri Sadananda Ji wrote

<<  Yes, the context of the teaching is very important. Uddalaka starts
 questioning his son, ‘Have you learned knowing which you will know
 everything’ – eka vijnaanena sarva vijnanaam bhavati >>,

To which Sri Srinath Ji responded

<< But in Advaitic doctrine point of view that context is not met. When
Brahman is known "everything"  is not known per se, because jnAni realizes
there is no "other thing" >>.

Since Sri Sadananda Ji has not responded so far to this , I thought of just
clarifying the advaita position in this regard as  per my understanding.
The “eka vijnaana “ intended here is not what Sri Srinath Ji has mentioned.
The “eka vijnaana “ refers to jIva-brahma aikya vijnaana as exemplified  in
the Ch Up 6-8-7 shruti vaakya

<< स य एषोऽणिमैतदात्म्यमिदꣳ सर्वं तत्सत्यꣳ स आत्मा तत्त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो >>

<< sa ya eSho.aNimaitadAtmyamidaꣳ sarvaM tatsatyaꣳ sa AtmA tattvamasi
shvetaketo >>
