Namaste,

We can only share what is given in scriptures.  However, cannot point the 'Ultimate Truth' to somebody.

The one who has realised the Ultimate Truth can only take the responsibility of pointing this to somebody else

To become a Guru / Acharya is not an easy task and our Gita teacher used to scold us when
we used to think & point towards someone who is 'less intelligent' and unable to cope up with studies.  
When we think that someone doesn't know anything / knows something; it implies that we know more in compared
to that person.  Unknowingly, we slip into 'मिथ्याचारः' 

Quite often, these tendencies of 'teaching others' slip from our pen but as far as 'adhAtma-vidyA' is concerned,
we shouldn't don the role of Guru / Acharya.  This is very dangerous in our path of sAdhana.

कृष्णं वन्दे जगद्गुरुम्

rgs,
sriram

         Dear Sri Venkata Sriram,
 I completely agree with
 you.The Ultimate truth has to be
 pointed outto all the persons
 irrespective of theirgrasping power.
 When their aMtaHkaraNa gets t uned to
 that frequency resonating to the
 Ultimate Truth by 
 The
 Grace of The Guru and The
 Divinity,the reciter no longer
 remains as a reciter butabide as
 the KNOWER of RECITATION.Is it not
 a fact?
 With
 respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy

 Cognition of that
 Changeless Principle who exists

 Shiva 
  and who
 illumines the very thinking and uttering of
 the names 
  by
 the reciter of the names will bestow upon
 the thinker / reciter 
  amRutatva / moksha. This is  for

 True....but we must not
 forget that people have different IQ & intelligence
 levels and
 grasping
 power vary from person to person. 

 bahiryAga leads to
 antaryAga...and the the 'devotee' in us should not
 be 
 ignored in the
 pursuit of knowledge. 

 karma
 becomes mukhya and jnAna as gauNa initially and later
 jnAna becomes mukhya and
 karma as gauNa. At the end,
 karma merges in jnAna and only jnAna remains...

 rgs,
 sriram
