 Dear Sri Venkata Sriram,
I completely agree with you.The Ultimate truth has to be pointed outto all the persons irrespective of theirgrasping power. When their aMtaHkaraNa gets t uned to that frequency resonating to the Ultimate Truth by 
The Grace of The Guru and The Divinity,the reciter no longer remains as a reciter butabide as the KNOWER of RECITATION.Is it not a fact?
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy

 Namaste,

Cognition of that Changeless Principle who exists 
 even before the thinking or  uttering of the names of Lord Shiva 
 and who illumines the very thinking and uttering of the names 
 by the reciter of the names will bestow upon the thinker / reciter 
 amRutatva / moksha. This is for sure and certain.

True....but we must not forget that people have different IQ & intelligence levels and
grasping power vary from person to person. 

bahiryAga leads to antaryAga...and the the 'devotee' in us should not be 
ignored in the pursuit of knowledge. 

karma becomes mukhya and jnAna as gauNa initially and later
jnAna becomes mukhya and karma as gauNa. At the end,
karma merges in jnAna and only jnAna remains...

rgs,
sriram
