 Dear Sri Keshava Mahadeva, Cognition of that Changeless Principle who exists 
even before the thinking or  uttering of the names of Lord Shiva 
and who illumines the very thinking and uttering of the names 
by the reciter of the names will bestow upon the thinker / reciter 
amRutatva / moksha. This is for sure and certain.
That is what mantra 2-4 of Kena Upanishad is proclaiming.With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.
