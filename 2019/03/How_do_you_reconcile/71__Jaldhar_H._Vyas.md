Bhagavati Uma and Saraswati (including Her avatara as Bharati) are no more 
women than Ganeshji is an elephant or Hanumanji is a monkey.

It definitely applies to the upanishads as they are part of the Vedas too.

However the basic adhikara for Vedanta is viveka (as opposed to the 
karmakanda which is desire for heavenly reward -- svarga kama)  Now women 
are certainly capable of viveka indeed any being endowed with 
consciousness should.  But if they cannot do shravana of atleast the 
mahavakyas there would appear to be a catch-22.

The Smarta response is that Bhagavan Veda Vyas out of compassion for those 
in this quandary took the essence of the Vedas and composed the 18 puranas 
bhagavata etc. and the Mahabharata (which includes the Bhagavadgita.) By 
listening to those, the anadhikaris can also attain the supreme goal.
