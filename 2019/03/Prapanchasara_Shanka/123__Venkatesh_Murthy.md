Namaste

Siva and Brahma are tricked by Asuras many times. Like Bhasmasura
tricked Siva and wanted to use Siva's boon to burn Him only. Vishnu
rescued Siva. Vishnu also once got married to Lakshmi's sisters and
lived with them happily forgetting He is Vaikuntha Pati. Siva had to
come and challenge for battle. In the battle Vishnu remembered His
true nature.

After Narasimha Avatara also Siva had to come as Sarabha and fight
with Narasimha and make Him to realize He is Vishnu. These stories are
showing Tri Murtis can be tricked also like ordinary Jeevas.

There are many stories showing Ishwara can be tricked by Maayaa.
Another thing is Kaala is the great destroyer and nobody can withstand
His power. Krishna was shot by a hunter and died. Raama also left His
body after Lakshmana and others died. What is Kaala? It is  Maayaa
only. There was a discussion here to show Kaala is a power of Maayaa
only. Therefore Maayaa is powerful and trick everybody.
