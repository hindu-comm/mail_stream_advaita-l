Thanks Raghav ji, for the reference from Sri Ramakrishna's words. We are
also reminded of the episode related to Shankaracharya, in the body of the
King (after para kaaya pravesha), who did not return to his original state
even after the deadline he had himself pre-set had expired. His disciples
were anxious and it is said that they went to the King's court and sang a
few Vedantic verses to 'awaken' the Master.

I think such stories have a subtle message embedded. Not being able to see
that and appreciate it, people in their stupidity assign 'God X is superior
to God Y because the former was able to 'kill'/overpower the latter.'  That
is the bane of the society. Swami Paramarthananda once observed: More than
the need for Bhashyas to study the Upanishads, we need bhashyas for the
Purana-s. The greatest mistake happens when people read puranas without
understanding the right purport, ending up with misunderstanding.'  How
true!
