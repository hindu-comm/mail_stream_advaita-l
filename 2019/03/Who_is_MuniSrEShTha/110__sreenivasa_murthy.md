Dear Readers,
 Who is MuniSrEShTha?
For the above question a SlOka from 
Mahabharata gives the answer. 
It reads thus : 
sva lakShaNaM tu yO vEda sa muniSrEShTha ucyatE ||One is a muniSrEShTha who knows his svalakShaNa 
i.e. his real svarUpa. 
How to know one's true svalakShaNa? 
Mantras 2-1-3 & 2-1-4 of Kathopanishad 
and Mantra 2-4 of Kena Upanishad 
give the methodology for the one 
to know / cognize his real svarUpalakShaNa 
in a very simple and direct way.
With respectful namaskars. 
Sreenivasa Muthy.
