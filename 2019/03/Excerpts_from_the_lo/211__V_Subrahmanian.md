The ‘lost’ kAThaka shaakhaa has yielded a set of srauta and grihya sutras.
An excerpt from these and other texts that remain only as quotations in
other works reveals to us that from the most ancient times vaidikas
worshiped both Vishnu and Shiva through various karma-s. We also get a
glimpse of the status of Gayathri, as the Shakti worshiped by the
Trimurti-s.
