 Namaste Sri Bhaskar Ji,

We have discussed on several occasions what Realization means and what is
the state of a jnAni postRealization. Unfortunately our views do not
coincide.

Reg << when there is acceptance there is astitvaM (existence / satyatvaM)
where is the question of sOpAdhika bhrAnti in realization ?? Kindly
elaborate.>>,

To repeat, in my understanding, world does not disappear from perception
for a jnAni. He perceives it, but understands it as bhrAnti, sOpAdhika
bhrAnti. Perception will last, generally speaking, as long as upAdhi,
namely BMI, lasts.
