I'm sure you have got some great answers to your satisfaction. To me,
prArabdha of the
sharIra(s) is sufficient answer be it for lokasaMgraha or not. However, I
just want to focus
on the word "should" that you bring up here which ties in nicely with your
subject-line word
"need".

Prior to rise of knowledge, even laT lakAra verbs are interpreted as
vidhili~N/ loT (injunction).
After the rise of knowledge, even li~N/loT verbs are interpreted as laT
(non-injunction). In
other words, there is no need for a jnAnI to do anything. jnAni's karma is
karmAbhAsa.

Kind rgds,
