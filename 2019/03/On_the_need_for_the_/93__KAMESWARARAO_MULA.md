Dear Bhaskar Ji, It was Akhilesh who mentioned in the very first mail that Prahlada was instructed by vishnu to rule the underworld. Yes, I too watched the story of the troubles of father-son in the telugu movie 'Bhakta Prahlada' several times and Indeed happy to be in the sat-sang of people like you and your conclusion elevates me to submit the karma phala to sriguru's feet. 
As it relates to one of the major indian festival tomarrow Holi:
Hirnyakasipâ€™ssister, Holika, was blessed by Brahma that she will not be effected by firefor ever in her life. She had a shawl, which would protect her. She was asked byher brother to be seated in the flames with Prahlad to kill him. However, assoon as the fire soared, the blessed shawl of Holika fluttered away to coverPrahlad. In this way, Prahlada lived as he never losts his faith and Holikaburnt and died. 
Todayi.e day before Holi, lots of wooden sticks are gathered in the ground, and areworshiped. A thread is tied around a small piece of bread and placed on thefire. It is believed that even though the bread burns, the thread remainsclean. This is a memorial of how the evil (the bread) is destroyed, while thethread (the soul ) is eternal.The moral of the story of Kama Deva and KamaDahanam ritual is that a person should get rid of all his selfish desires withthe burning of Holika. Holika Dahan is celebrated in memory of this event.Onthe eve of Holi after sunset, the pyre is lit, signifying Holika Dahan. Theritual symbolises the victory of good over evil. People sing and dance aroundthe fire. People also perform pradakshina.The next day people play with colors,the popular festival of colors & Festival of Love.

Although in the sited example of 'Prahlada', Ultimately he is kings son, he has to rule the underworld as a duty, so vishnu might have instructed him to do so although he is liberated at that moment.
My interpretation in this case : Since in one way he is responsible for his father's i.e Hiranyakasipa's death (what ever may be the reason). Although Hiranyakasipa praised his son after seeing vishnu in the narasimha-rupa. In simple terms, both Prahlada & Hiranyakasipa share the same sukshma sarira (being the father & son) , Prahlada was liberated at that moment with that body but he got that from his father. In one way or other little sin might be adhered to him for the responsibility of his father's death. So 'Vishnu' being the superpower may be keeping this point in mind, might have instructed 'Prahlada' to rule the underworld so that he can get ridd off anything which is accumulated.
I don't know my words rightly placed or not or to comment on 'Bhagavattoma-Prahlada' , just i thought like this by seeing the entire scenario.

> Just on the lighter side, you have used the word 'underworld' twice, my mind influenced by seeing Kannada films, started to wonder how parama bhagavatOttama prahlAda could become an underworld king that too with god's grace ðŸ˜Š Anyway, coming back to issue above, there is a reference in sUtra bhAshya with reference to gradations in mukta jeeva-s, those jeeva-s in the elite club have the special privilege to incarnate again to uplift the jeeva-s still in ajnAna, the instruction they would get with regard to this is from svayaM 'paramAtma'. Other ordinary mukta jeeva-s after realization will not get rebirth. This apAntaratama-s like jeeva-s would drag their remaining prArabdha to incarnate as per the instructions from paramAtma. So, ultimate decision taking authority with regard to subsequent janma-s of certain jeeva-s pertains to 'paramAtma'. Here in the above case, it is paramAtma's (narasiMha) instruction to prahlAda (the mukta jeeva) to continue to rule the world. And in next janma hanumanta, then as Bheema sena ( one among pAndava-s) and then madhvA if I am right according to madhva sampradaya ðŸ˜Š In short what does it tell us in upa siddhAnta ?? Even after paripUrNa jnana jeeva-s would continue to maintain different gradations, some are elevated ones and some others are normal ones. The elevated ones still have to obey the instructions of paramAtma the supreme commander of all types of jeeva who is karmAdhyaksha and karma phala dAta. Whether this is dvaita or Advaita !!?? I leave it to your discretion. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
