Although you got some answers it looks like the conversation went on a 
slight tangent.  So I hope the following answer is helpful.

Because the worlds themselves are also Brahman.  There is nothing that is 
not Brahman.  So the process of realizing the self is not a subtractive 
but an additive one. In other words the goal is not to destroy the 
world-appearance but to encompass and extend it.

It is said that the reason newborn babies move their arms and legs around 
is because their brains are trying to determine where exactly they end and 
the outside world begins.  As the child grows up they learn more they are. 
I am from this country, and this locality.  I speak this language.  I 
belong to this family and this caste and this religion.  I have this job, 
and these posessions and this place in society.  And so many other things 
that combine to give a person a sense of self.  Unfortunately, most people 
will stop there.  Vedantic sadhana involves realizing "the self" is not 
just the body but much more.  Hence the various upasanas on different 
objects, the stories of Bhagavan and His avataras etc.
