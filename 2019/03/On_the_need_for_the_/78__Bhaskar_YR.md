I'm trying to understand an interesting scriptural point. The question  is what is the best interpretation of the rationale given for *why* the jivanmukta acts or should act in the world.

>  lOka saMgraha one of the clarifications given by Geeta bhAshyakAra by citing the example of the king janaka.  avidyAlesha / prArabdha karma of the jnAni is the driving force,  another explanation by sampradaya with regard to why jeevanmukta would act even after realization.  In yadrucchaa lAbha saMtushtO shloka bhAshya bhagavatpAda says even though he looks like he himself engaged in karma like bhikshAtana etc. he is akatru only.  How so??  For him each and every act encompassed in satyatvaM since there is nothing apart from HIM.  sadAtmanA satyatva abhyupagamAt sarva vyavahArANAM cha satyatvaM clarifies bhAshyakAra elsewhere.  Which has been explained in below statements by our Sri Jaldhar Vyas prabhuji :  

// quote //
Because the worlds themselves are also Brahman.  There is nothing that is not Brahman.  So the process of realizing the self is not a subtractive but an additive one. In other words the goal is not to destroy the world-appearance but to encompass and extend it.

>  "the process of realizing the self is not a subtractive but an additive one"  So beautifully explained prabhuji.  This is what is called sarvAtma bhAva or samyak darshana.  sarvaM  hi asmAkaM AtmabhUtameva sarvasya cha vayaM AtmabhUtAH.  My humble prostrations to you.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
