Perhaps not exactly. Worlds  experienced  as निरुपाधिकभ्रान्ति
 (nirupAdhikabhrAnti ) (prior to Realization)  appears as सोपाधिकभ्रा॔ति
(sOpAdhikabhrAnti) on Realization, involving two “entities” namely the
नामरूपात्मक (nAmarUpAtmaka)  world and Brahman.  On Realization, the
नामरूपात्मक (nAmarUpAtmaka) aspect constituting the worlds is rejected
(destroyed, cognitively) leaving (cognitively) ONLY the अस्तिभातिप्रिया
(astibhAtipriyA) aspect pertaining to Brahman.

Regret the error.
