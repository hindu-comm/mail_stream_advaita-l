Please help Shankara ji find the book.  I remember seeing a correspondence
in this List on this book, with commentary.

Thanks

Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} English translation of Anubhutiprakasa of
Vidyaranyaswami
To: भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Pranams to all,

One of my friends is looking for English translation of Anubhutiprakasa of
Vidyaranyaswami (in print or soft copy).

The only translation of Anubhutiprakasa in English seems to be that of
Godabarisha Mishra published by University of Madras in 1992. This book is
not available at Amazon or similar online book sites. -
http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34319552

Would it be available at University of Madras? Google search did not yield
any useful information. Any info about its availability is welcome.

If someone from BVP has got a scanned copy of English translation of
Anubhutiprakasa, please share it, since the book seems to be out of print.

regards
shankara
