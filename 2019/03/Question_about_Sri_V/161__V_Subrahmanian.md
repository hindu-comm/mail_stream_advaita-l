Here is what Bhagavan Ramana said when robbers visited the Ashram and even
beat him:

http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4636.0

//Some days later the police caught the thieves and brought them before Sri
Bhagavan, and an officer asked Him to identify the one who had beaten Him
on that night. Sri Bhagavan at once replied with a smile, 'Find out whom I
beat [in a previous birth], for it is he who has beaten me now!'. He never
denounced the criminal!//

This is what traditional Advaita would say about prarabdha karma for a
Jnani. Swami Vidyaranya has said this alone. It is not for the bystanders
to say this; it is the Jnani himself who says this.
