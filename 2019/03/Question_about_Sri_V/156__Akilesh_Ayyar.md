Well, to be fair, I don't think SV was concluding that Yajnavalkya was a
"mere theoretical" jnani.

As Praveenji points out, he regards him as a full jnani and (videha)mukta
-- but simply one where the quality of the prArabdha remaining is less
sattvic than what SV calls a jivanmukta. It is only a difference in the
quality of prArabdha. As Bhagavan Ramana has said regarding these kinds of
classifications, the experience of the jnani is the same regardless: "There
is no difference in the samadhi state or the jnana of the jnanis. The
classification is only from the standpoint of the observer."
