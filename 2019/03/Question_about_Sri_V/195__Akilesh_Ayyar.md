Bhaskarji,

Very interesting comments. Ah yes, if that is what you mean then I am in
agreement. By their imaginations I certainly did not mean to say that it
came out of the onlookers' tiny minds.

Well, I am in agreement except for one small point. I prefer not to say
that Ishwara holds a place only in vyavaHara. That is true only of a
limited concept of Ishwara.

If by Ishwara is meant karma-phala-data, creator, and so on, yes, that is
avidya kalpita, but the true Ishwara is that which exceeds all those
concepts. The true Ishwara is Brahman.

Bhagavan says:

"Existence of Ishwara follows from our conception of Ishwara. Let us first
know whose concept He is. The concept will be only according to the one who
conceives. Find out who you are and the other problem will solve itself."

"Ishwara exists without and distinct from illusion, but there is no
illusion without Ishwara."

"Disciple: Convince me of the existence of God.
Maharshi: Realisation of the Self amounts to such conviction."

"Just as all beings, moving and unmoving, engage in their own activities
due to the mere presence of the sun, which rises without any prior
intention, so it is said in the scriptures that all actions are performed
by God [who in truth neither acts nor has intentions]."

"That eternal and subtlest Being which pervades and transcends all is God."

Thank you for this fascinating quote and explication.
