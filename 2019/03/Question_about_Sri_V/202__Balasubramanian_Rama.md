Dear Bhaskar,

I am not sure what you think eka-jIva-vAda is - from the stuff below it
seems you think it's some kind of theory that a single jIva is creating
something. Assuming that's what you think that's far from what it is.
Please see bhagavatpAda-s commentary to gauDapAda-kArika-s 2.16:

jIvam kalpayate pUrvam.

First of all, pUrvam is not a point in time here.

bAhya-adhyAtmikAnAM bhAvAnAM itaretara nimitta-namittikatayA kalpanAyAM kiM
mUlaM iti |
ucyate -
jIvaM hetu-phalAtmakaM |
ahaM karomi, mama sukha-duHkhe ityevaM lakaShaNam |
anevamlakShaNa eva, shuddhe Atmani rajjvAmiva sarpa kalpayate pUrvaM |

The understanding is that from the experience of vyavahAra and using the
correct means of knowledge, we understand that shruti declares the
brahmAtma ekatvam. How is this to be understood then in terms of why we see
multiplicity? We understand that there is a superposition of the individual
I, which is pUrvaM in the sense of being the root cause, which creates a
wrong understanding of inside the self vs outside the self , etc. When this
is the case, it  would be silly to imagine that "other" jIva-s (which are
themselves a result of the "pUrvam", i.e., superposition of the I) have
some extra, special reality. This is what the term eka-jIva-vAda succinctly
expresses. When this is understood questions like "What happens to the
j~nAni after realization", etc. are equally not valid questions.
