Thank you Akilesh Ayyar for taking the time to explain.  Having been
exposed to the Bhashya-s and the utterings of and the writings on the
Acharyas of Sringeri, I find myself more comfortable in comprehending and
appreciating these than the statements purportedly of Bhagavan Ramana. I
find the former quite in tune with reason. Swami Vidyaranya's Panchadashi
and JMV too do not pose any difficulty.  The life of a Jivan mukta has been
recently seen and written upon in books like the Yoga, Enlightenmen and
Perfection.  There I see no loose ends.   What you say here //So the I is
replaced by our own nature; the mind is destroyed but speaking is
possible.// is fine. The third shloka that Shankara cites (from a Sundara
Pandya) at the end of the bhashya for the fourth Brahma sutra says 'that
which was seen as the pramatru, jiva, (I), is now known to be the Self.'
And all that Shankara says in the entire bhashya corpus, and those of other
Acharyas of Advaita, fits in finely with this. Nowhere does one get the
feeling 'this is for seekers only and not close to the Truth.' The Bhashyas
do not fall in the category of something that does not deliver the ultimate
truth.

You say: //*“Since the experiences of seeing [hearing, tasting and so on]
are, when experienced, the same for Muktas [as for others], and since they
[the Muktas] are thus experiencing the many differences which appear as a
result of seeing [hearing and so on], they are experiencing non-difference
[even while seeing those differences]” – to say so is wrong.//*

*This I think contradicts the Bh.gita and bhashya: 5.18: *

विद्याविनयसम्पन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि ।
शुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिताः समदर्शिनः ॥ १८ ॥

विनयसम्पन्ने उत्तमसंस्कारवति ब्राह्मणे सात्त्विके, मध्यमायां च राजस्यां गवि

Panditah, the learned ones; sama-darsinah, look with eanimity; brahmane, on
a Brahmana; vidya-vinayasampanne, endowed with learning and humility-vidya
means knowledge of the Self, and vinaya means pridelessness-, on a Brahmana
who has Self-knowledge and modesty; gavi, on a cow; hastini, on an
elephant; ca eva, and even; suni, on a dog; ca, as well as; svapake, on an
eater of dog's meat. Those learned ones who are habituated to see (really)
the unchanging, same and one Brahman, absolutely untouched by the qualities
of sattva etc. and the tendencies created by it, as also by the tendencies
born of rajas and tamas, in a Brahmana, who is endowed with Knowledge and
tranillity, who is possessed of good tendencies and the quality of sattva;
in a cow, which is possessed of the middling ality of rajas and is not
spiritually refined; and in an elephant etc., which  are wholly and
absolutely imbued with the reality of tamas-they are seers of reality.
How can this 'seeing non-difference in difference' be wrong? How can the
vision of non-difference be spoken of unless in the face of difference,
though difference is a manifestation of ignorance?
If it is said 'there is no difference first of all, and therefore there is
also no vision of non-difference', then we are in the 'na nirodh na
chotpattih....paramarthathaa.'  Then there is no speaking and no hearing.
Vidyaranya has said: chodyam vaa parihaaro vaa kriyataam dvaitabhaashayaa.
In paramartha, there is neither question nor reply.
