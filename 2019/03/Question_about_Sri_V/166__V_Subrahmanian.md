Yes, the Jnani Shankara and Bhagavan Krishna have emphatically said that
the Jnani has a body. In BSB 4.1.15 Shankara has asked: How can anyone deny
a Jnani's conviction of being Brahman and also being in a body? This alone
is taught as sthita prajna lakshana in shruti and smriti.

In the Gita Krishna has taught: nava dvaare purey dehi naiva kurvan na
kaarayan.

Thus, the Jnani does say he has a body. The Jnani can say he has no body
while being in the body.  Only when the disciple asks and if the jnani
shows no signs of hearing it, can the disciple conclude that Jnana is a
disease and the Jnani is afflicted by that disease.

So, it is best to study the Shankara bhashya correctly without getting
confused with Ramana's stray teachings. In the Bhashya we have no room for
inconsistency.  If we speak of a Jnani then there has to be
'sthitaprajnasya kaa bhaashaa,  etc. that Arjuna asks.' Shankara does not
say 'Arjuna is imagining these things.' Nor does the Lord say in the 4th
chapter: do not approach Jnanis for learning about Atma tattva because
there is no Jnani'. On the other hand Krishna says 'approach Jnanis who are
tattva darshis and they will impart the knowledge to you.'
