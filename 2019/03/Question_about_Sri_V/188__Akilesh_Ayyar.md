Namaste Raghavji,

Yes, this makes sense.

The difficulty with keeping the standpoints separate as you counsel below
is that the pAramArthika standpoint is not quite actually a standpoint. It
is the going-beyond-standpoints.

For it is not quite the case that in that standpoint that the jnani is
simply non-existent or contradictory like any normal idea or object is.

Like Brahman itself, the jnani is beyond the concept of is and isn't.

So how does one communicate in language this sense of going beyond
contradictions?

It is no mere "not seeing" in which the jnani with GYAna svarUpa engages.
It is not the "not seeing" of the blind man. It is a not-seeing that is
beyond the ordinary dualism of seeing and not-seeing. To capture both of
these aspects dynamically, we have to hang between these standpoints --
that hanging *is* in fact the true pAramArthika standpoint.

First we bring an idea up -- "seeing" -- and then we contradict -- "not
seeing" -- and in the space created by that negation... is the holy light
of truth.

It is like another thing Maharshi says about the jnani's experience:

"If suddha manas is admitted, the Bliss (Ananda) experienced by the Jnani
must also be admitted to be reflected. This reflection must finally merge
into the Original. Therefore the jivanmukti state is compared to the
reflection of a spotless mirror in another similar mirror. What will be
found in such a reflection? Pure Akasa (Ether). Similarly, the jnani’s
reflected Bliss (Ananda) represents only the true Bliss. These are all only
words."

The "reflected Bliss" is in fact nothing other than the Self. It is
"admitted" only in a necessarily artificial conceptual scheme.

At the extreme, in other words, the "standpoints" lose their independent
identities, as do all objects.
