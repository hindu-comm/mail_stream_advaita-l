We have, in the past on this list, discussed the eka-jIva-vAda as being the
siddhanta prescribed for advanced seekers. It may be useful to see that, in
the context of EJV/DSV, the question relating to a jnAni and his
activities, sense of having a body, etc. gets transformed with an entirely
different meaning! When the seeker is the only jIva there is and even
entities such as Guru, other jIvas, jnAni's etc are admitted to be
imaginations of the sole seeker, serving the purpose of guiding him or
inspiring him, it is the so-called onlooker's (seeker's) viewpoint that
becomes important. For, the jnAni's viewpoint is not so much relevant, as
long as such a jnAni is *not* the seeker, but someone else. The jnAni's
viewpoint may still be relevant as a guide of what to expect after the rise
of jnana, but not so much as the experience of a jnAni other than the
seeker.
