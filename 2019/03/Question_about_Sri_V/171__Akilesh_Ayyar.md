Well, if we are going by Ramana's ideas, a jnani is not a person at all.

So since this is the case, then there cannot really be for a jnani any
avidyAlesha, any rAga-dvesha -- because the jnani is not a person. All
these again *are* posited only for onlookers.

He says: "In sahaja samadhi the activities, vital and mental, and the three
states are destroyed, never to reappear. However, others notice the Jnani
active e.g., eating, talking, moving etc. He is not himself aware of these
activities, whereas others are aware of his activities. They pertain to his
body and not to his Real Self, swarupa. For himself, he is like the
sleeping passenger - or like a child interrupted from sound sleep and fed,
being unaware of it."

Indeed, in the end even the very concept of a jnani is from the standpoint
of onlookers, because the concept of liberation is itself in the end wrong.

See Maharshi's last verse in his 40 verses: "If it is said that Liberation
is of three kinds, with form or with and without form, then let me tell you
that the extinction of the three forms of Liberation is the only true
Liberation."

Yes, if that is what the so-called traditional camp believes, then that is
a pity :-)
