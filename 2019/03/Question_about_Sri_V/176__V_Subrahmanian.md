I can appreciate that from the standpoint of na nirodho na chotpattih....no
seeker, there is none who is realized, etc. But to say 'Jnani never
perceives anything but others perceive his activities, etc.' is not in tune
with the idea of paramaarthathaa.  This statement accepts someone as a
Jnani, not yet dead, but denies others' perception of his activities as
their own imagination. The statement is hanging somewhere between two
standpoints. This is what I questioned. Your answers do not address this.

The VC verse does not cause any confusion that the purported Ramaana
statement throws up.
