I'd like to make a samanvaya proposition though on your next

Whatever is mentioned as an onlooker's perspective can be
understood as *associating the jnAnI with the body-mind-sense-
complex* whereas the association is no longer there in the case of
the jnAnI.

Finally, I urge you to take the traditional perspective from a
traditionalist and not from those who say what the traditionalists
say, since for them the tradition itself is a "so-called" tradition!

For what its worth, orthodox tradition and Bhagavan Ramana's
teachings have never been at war with each other. This list has
seen many a discussion on that as well. If anything, they are one
and the same and just as the former can be confused without
proper context, so can the latter.
