At the end of the bhashya for the BG 2.16, Shankara says:
त्वमपि तत्त्वदर्शिनां दृष्टिमाश्रित्यशोकं मोहं च हित्वा शीतोष्णादीनि
नियतानियतरूपाणि द्वन्द्वानि ‘विकारोऽयमसन्नेव मरीचिजलवन्मिथ्यावभासते’ इति
मनसि निश्चित्य तितिक्षस्वइत्यभिप्रायः ॥ १६ ॥

The teaching of this verse for Arjuna is: You too, following the ways of
the Jnanis, give up misery and delusion and look upon the dualities with
the firm conviction as mere appearances like the mirage water but do not
exist in reality' and practice forbearance.

Shankara says here that the Jnanis look upon the dualities as unreal, mere
appearances like mirage water..
