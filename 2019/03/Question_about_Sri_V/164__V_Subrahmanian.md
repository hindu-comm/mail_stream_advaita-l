Dear Bhaskar ji,

To one of my quotes of Ramana's words, you are giving another quote that
you think contradicts my quote of Ramana. But all this is actually showing
Ramana in poor light, as someone who contradicts himself. So let me add to
this 'damage':

https://www.inner-quest.org/Ramana_Abide.htm

quote:

*Question:* Does a jnani in the body remain visible?

*Ramana:* Why not?

*Question:* Body is the reflection of the mind. There ought to be
modifications because of it.

*Ramana:* In whose view should a jnani's body have a change?

*Question:* To the outside view.

*Ramana:* Then a jnani ought to be invisible? All who wrote books, lived
and moved are ajnanis [those who are ignorant of their true nature]. Is
that so? [laughing] Does the jnani himself feel oppressed by the body? Does
he need a certificate from others by their not seeing his body?

unquote

So here we see Ramana saying the opposite of what you quoted him as saying.
Also, Ramana has said: There is no Jnani; there is only Jnanam (Brahman).

One can easily see that this is said from the 'na nirodhi no
chotpatti.....' paramarthataa state.

We can end up saying: Even what is 'said' to be stated by Ramana is only
ajnanis' imagination; in fact there is no person at all called Ramana, that
is also ajnani's imagination. And the robbers raiding the Ashram, Ramana
getting a blow or two from them, and what he said about it later, all are
only imaginations of ajnani-s. They never happened at all.

regards
subbu
