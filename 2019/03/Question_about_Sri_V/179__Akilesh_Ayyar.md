Certainly the Bhashyas deliver ultimate truth, but such ultimate truth is
not to be found in the statements themselves, but in the effect of the
statements on the mind of the listener. Bhashya statements when reflected
upon and applied cancel out ignorant prior beliefs rather than introducing
independent propositions of their own, and the net effect is finally the
direction of the mind beyond verbal beliefs and statements. Thus the
statement that leads to truth depends on the situation and context of the
one who hears the statement. So that different things may be said of
ultimate reality (which cannot be accurately described) depending on the
situation and context of the listener.

It is exactly like the original Ramana statement we were talking about: the
differences are only in the view of the onlookers.

Where to onlookers it appears there is a Brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a
dog, etc. -- to the wise one there is only Brahman "untouched by the
qualities of sattva, etc."

Otherwise it makes no sense. How can the qualityless Brahman be seen *in* a
cow? The cow is itself a notion born of ignorance. The qualityless Brahman
is not really seen *within *an ignorant notion of quality; the qualityless
Brahman alone is seen by the wise where the ignorant perceive the cow, etc.

And yet there is the desire in this statement to indicate that the jnani
does not see a cow, but also does not merely see an absence of a cow, nor
does he see some common quality to cows, brahmanas, etc. The jnani sees
beyond the duality of cow and no-cow, beyond the duality of difference and
non-difference.

And what Bhagavan said in the original statement we were discussing is of
course nothing other than what is said in Gita 2:69

"What is like night to all ignorant beings, to that Atman-consciousness the
self-controlled sage is awake; and the sensate life to which all ignorant
beings are awake, that is like night to this illumined sage."

Well, the problem is that even saying "there is neither question nor reply"
is itself a reply. It is itself a statement given in the context of a
conversation (like the one we are having now). So as soon as we say a word
we are bound within shifting language games and can only hope to get at the
truth by cancelling out ignorant beliefs, and then allowing jnana to shine
in the mental space so created. Even saying nothing is saying something,
because saying nothing is always an action in a human context, taking place
in space and time, and thus is subject to interpretation.
