Selections from the Vrata KaanDa of Hemadri's Chaturvarga Chintamani

The ‘Vrata kaaNDa’ (section on vows and observances) of Hemadri’s (13th
Century CE) ‘Chaturvarga Chintamani’ Vol.2, Part 1, contains hundreds of
vrata-s that the author has found fit to be listed for the use of the
followers of sanatana dharma.  A perusal of the list throws light on the
practices of the vaidika-s of the author’s period and before. We can see
that vaidika-s had no narrow views about the worshiping of various deities
of the sanatana dharma. That shows that maintaining such narrow views as to
‘only certain deities are fit to be worshiped and not others’ is an unvedic
one, not to the approval of Shankaracharya and his followers.

A selection from the text of Hemadri is given in the file downloadable from
