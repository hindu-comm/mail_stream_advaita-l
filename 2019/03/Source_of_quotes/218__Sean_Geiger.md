Ryan,
The Anvaya Vyatireka principle is well documented in Advaita and logic
sources. anvaya means the presence of one thing with another, and vyatireka
means the absence of one thing when the other is absent. For instance, the
logical declaration, "where there is smoke there is fire", can be explained
as the presence of fire wherever smoke is present- anvaya, and the absence
of fire wherever smoke is absent- vyatireka, although in this case, it is
not necessarily true that fire has to be absent when smoke is absent. There
could be smokeless fire. For examples from Advaita, see

I could not find explanations for your second quote. I hope someone will be
able to explain it.

Best regards,
Sean
