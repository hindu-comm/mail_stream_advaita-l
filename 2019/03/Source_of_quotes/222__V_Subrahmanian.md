I think this is a general rule that has been used to state the phenomenon
of anvaya-vyatireka.  Its proper form is यत्सत्त्वे यत्सत्त्वम्, यदभावे
यदभावः.  When applied to a specific case, its form transforms to what you
have cited. So I think one need not look for an original source of the
first ever occurrence of this rule.
