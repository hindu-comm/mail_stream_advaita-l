The anvaya-vyatireka logic is used in determining cause-effect
relationship.  If clay is present, pot is possible. This is anvaya. If clay
is absent, pot is not possible. This is vyatireka. One can use this in many
instances like when four-fold qualities are there, brahma vichara is
possible. Else, not. When Jnana is there, mukti is there, else, not.
