The Trimurti-s appear and disappear in every kalpa  - The Parasara Dharma
Samhita

The Parasara Smriti, a dharmashastra work, is an ancient one.  It says that
the Trimurtis have origination and disappearance in each creation cycle.
This is in perfect agreement with the Atharvashikha Upanishad which says:
brahmaviShNurudrendrAste samprasUyante..[Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra and Indra
are born..]

Sayanacharya (Madhavacharya) has commented on this text elaborately and the
same is available in multiple volumes.
