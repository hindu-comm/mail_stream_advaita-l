Dear readers, 

Here is a teaching from the pen of an Englishman.Please chew well, digest and assimilate.
Rupert Spira says : 
 "As the witnessing background of all experience 
 we are inherently free from all things; 
 as the substance of all experience 
  we are intimately one with all things."
Sri Shankara writes : AtmA sarvagatatvAt sarvAnanyatvAcca ||Bruhadadaranyaka Upanishad says : asaMgO hi ayaM puruShaH ||ayamAtmA brahma sarvAnuBUH iti anuSAsanam ||
These two thought positions from Vedantic tradition 
have been beautifully and precisely brought out 
by Rupert Spira in simple English language.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
