Sri SSS in paramArtha chitAmaNi says recollection of sushupti by waker only inference of the waking mind about sushupti.  Vishwa, taijasa have no entry when prAjna holding the sway in sushupti.  In avasthA traya Chandrika also he elaborates this point.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

I have not used the term  ** sushupti ** in my response.  The term  ** during sleep ** in the first sentence of my post cited by Sri Bhaskar Ji refers to the recollection of the waker.
