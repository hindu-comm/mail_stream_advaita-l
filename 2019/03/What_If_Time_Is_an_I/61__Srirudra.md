Dears
Time is an abstract concept.It is like Maya.Really there is no Maya in the sense we say air is verifiable.Maya is deemed to be a cause for the effect which is perceptible.The cause is called Maya but ir does not exist .So also Time.Time is duration subsisting between two events which are separated occurrences.We call this as passing of time.But space is verifiable .We can physically or with our senses feel space .It is tangible.
During sleep we are not aware of our sleep.Mind also becomes still (in deep sleep which is dreamless)

> Light and the light of consciousness are somewhat related. One cannot see the light. One can only see the reflected light. In the same way, one cannot 'see' consciousness - only reflected consciousness. From the reflected light one can cognitively recognize the light - In the same way only via reflected consciousness, one can recognize the original light of consciousness.
