Chandramouliji - PraNAms
Yes, you are right. I have heard that statement before - not sure where.;

The fact is it is akhandasince in the deep sleep stage it is undifferentiated homogeneous- ignorance of everything. Since it is known - the consciousness is behind it. Of course, we can only report about that state ' I did not know anything' only when the instrument for communication - the mind and the faculty of speechare in the working condition.
I like the phrase too!
Anyway - with this, I remain.
Hari Om!Sadananda



Since avidyA vRittis in plural is mentioned, I am not sure if the term akhanda
aakaara ajnaana vRitti in sushupti is appropriate. Confirmation of its use
by some commentator would have been useful.
