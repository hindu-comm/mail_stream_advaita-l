Sri SSS in paramArtha chitAmaNi says recollection of sushupti by waker only inference of the waking mind about sushupti.

Interesting point!

Yes, interesting point and anubhavAtmaka fact as well.  If the waker’s mind is active in sushupti ( deep sleep) then sushupti anubhava would differ from individual to individual just like in waking and dream states where we have different experiences.  But interestingly when someone says :  yesterday night I had a sound sleep, nobody would ask the counter question what that experience is !! ??  The sukha-nidde ( dreamless sound sleep) anubhava is ONE and SAME for all.  Hence as soon as some one shares his experience of deep sleep we straightaway come to know what would be the ‘experience’ of that sound sleep.  This will not be the case when someone says :  I had a dream in my sleep, yesterday, why because karaNa (upAdhi) belongs to individual is different there hence we have to ask about the particulars of that dream state experienced only by that individual and same is the case in waking state.  The eka-rUpa anubhava in sushupti for everyone is because there is neither objects nor the indriya-s exist differently from oneself clarifies bhAshyakAra in bruhadAraNyaka.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
