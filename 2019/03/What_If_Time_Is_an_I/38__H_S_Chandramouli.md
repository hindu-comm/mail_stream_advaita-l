Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,

I was really not commenting on your post as such. Nor did I go through the
video. I just thought of taking this opportunity to clarify my
understanding on certain specific aspects of sushupti. With your permission
I will continue with that understanding.

Firstly I was pointing out that there is a state when triputi is present,
but concept of time and space is absent.  That is what I meant in my
earlier post. This does not  gel with your statement now made also

<< The mind is folded only means - the grosser aspect involving
subject-object duality is folded >>

and

<<  That is what sushupti or deep sleep state implies - the absence of
subject-object duality >>.



Yes. I agree that in sushupti, these statements hold good. But my point is
that before the person wakes up, he goes through a state where what I had
stated in my earlier post, and copied here again for ease of reference,
holds good.

<< There is recollection on waking of the type

<< I was very happy during sleep. I did not see anything >>.

Surely this must have been experienced during sleep. Otherwise recollection
is not possible. So mind is not folded and definitely active, including
triputi during this experience. But there is no notion of time or space
>>.



The following is from your latest post

<< That is what sushupti or deep sleep state implies - the absence of
subject-object duality - hence the ignorance - or akhanda aakaara ajnaana
vRitti >>.

Can you please give some reference to where this akhanda aakaara ajnaana
vRitti during sushupti is mentioned. I have not come across such a
statement.

Regards
