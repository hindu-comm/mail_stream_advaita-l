Namaste Sri Bhaskar Ji,

Reg  << Anyway, what is your take on this issue, do you think Vishwa can
make authentic comments on the avasthA where he himself is dormant ??
please clarify >>,

I will summarize my understanding of  the issue which will also reflect on
some of the points you have made in your other post to Sri Sadananda Ji. My
understanding is based on Panchadashi Chapter 11 Verses 64-74. Some
important points in this are also reflected in BUBV of Sri Sureswaracharya
( I am not able to give offhand specific references from this. If needed I
can do so later).

The experience of Sushupti recollected by the waker (Vishwa as you term it)
on waking is NOT the experience DURING Sushupti . It is the recollection of
the impressions (vAsanAs) of his experience DURING Sushupti  which persist
for a short duration immediately following Sushupti. The process  is
elaborated as follows.  For convenience, copying from a book by Sri TMP
Mahadevan  on Panchadashi , relevant portion

<< An examination of the moment immediately succeeding the termination of
sleep gives us intimation of the Brahman-bliss experienced during sleep ;
or there is then the persistence of residual impression of Brahman-bliss
which is borne out by the fact that a person who has just got up from sleep
remains calm and happy without any thought of external objects >>.

In brief this is how the experience of happiness and nescience in sleep  by
the Anandamaya self is transferred to the VignAnamaya self  and recollected
later by Vishwa on waking.  Reference to Panchadashi  directly would be
very useful.  Swami Vidyaranya also thereby brings out the difference
between VishayAnanda ( happiness brought about by objects)  which is only a
semblance of bliss, and vAsanAnanda  which is an impression of bliss which
is not the product of anything else.

I have only briefly summarized my views.  May appear somewhat random also.
Any specific elaboration can be tried if there are any queries.

Regards
