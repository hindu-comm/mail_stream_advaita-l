Namaste Sri Bhaskar Ji,

You have quoted Sri SSS  << Atmanu Anandamayanu >>  which perhaps is
intended to be translated as  << Atma is full with Ananda >>. But the
answer to your question

<< Now the question that needs to be looked into is, how vAsana-s created
in sushupti when there is no primary vrutti since karaNa-s (upAdhi-s) and
vishaya-s both are in upashAnta sthiti >>

happens to be  << Anadamaya >>,  understood a s  Anandamaya Atma.  Also
referred to by the term PrAjna in Mandukya while referring to jIva.

The definition of Anandamaya Atma is given in PD 11- 64

<< सुप्तिपूर्वक्षणे बुद्धिवृत्तिर्या  सुखबिंबिता ।

  सैव तद्बिंबसहिता लीनानंदमयस्ततः ॥ >>

<< suptipUrvakShaNe buddhivRRittiryA  sukhabiMbitA |

  saiva tadbiMbasahitA lInAnaMdamayastataH || >>.

I leave the translation part. It is best to refer to PD itself for details.
I only want to confirm that the question has been answered positively in
the text. This is the Anandamaya referred to in Mandukya verse 5.

Reg  << When there is no vishesha darshana how can a resultant vAsana be
created to recall in waking??  >>,

and

<< Here I think I need the elaboration, vAsanAnada which is an impression
of bliss but not the product of anything else >>,

What is enjoyed is not vishaya   which leads to vishesha darshana. It is
svarUpa which is experienced in its aspect as Ananda  very similar to but
not to the same extent what a jnAni enjoys on Realization..

Regards
