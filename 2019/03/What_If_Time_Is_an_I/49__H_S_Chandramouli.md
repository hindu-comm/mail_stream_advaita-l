Namaste Sri Bhaskar Ji,

Reg  << Sri SSS in paramArtha chitAmaNi says recollection of sushupti by
waker only inference of the waking mind about sushupti >>

and

<<  Yes, interesting point and anubhavAtmaka fact as well >>,

Can you please give some reference (page no etc) as to Sri SSS. What
exactly is the inference part ?? You term this experience as both  ** inference
** as well as  ** anubhavAtmaka fact **.  How can it be both fact and
inerence ?? Experience of Ananda in sushupti has shruti pramANa.  Mandukya
vesre 5  << Anandabhuk >> for example.
Regards
