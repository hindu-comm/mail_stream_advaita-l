Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,

Checked  Panchadashi-Chapter 11. There is no reference to  presence of  akhanda
aakaara ajnaana vRitti in sushupti.

On the other hand, verse 11-65 mentions arising of ajnAna vRittis during
sushupti. Both the commentators Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Achyutaraya Modak
mention that this is supported by Sri VivaraNAchArya. Sri Modak, against
verse 11-66, also cites, in support of this, from NyAyaratnAvaLi, a
commentary on SidhAnatabindu of Sri MadhusUdana Saraswati by Sri
BrahmAnanda Saraswati

<< “ साक्षिस्वरूपसुखस्वरूपाज्ञानस्वरूपाकारा
निर्विकल्पास्तिस्त्रोऽविद्यावृत्तयः सुषुप्तौ जायन्ते “  इति
विवरणेंऽगीकृतमिति ॥ >>

<< “ sAkShisvarUpasukhasvarUpAj~nAnasvarUpAkArA
nirvikalpAstistro.avidyAvRRittayaH suShuptau jAyante “  iti
vivaraNeM.agIkRRitamiti || >>

Since avidyA vRittis in plural is mentioned, I am not sure if the term  akhanda
aakaara ajnaana vRitti in sushupti  is appropriate. Confirmation of its use
by some commentator  would have been useful.
Regards
