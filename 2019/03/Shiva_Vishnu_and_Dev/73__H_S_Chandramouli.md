Reg  << During abhisheka in Sringeri the Shiva sphatika Linga, a salagrama
and
Srichakra (red object seen on the plate in the image below) are kept
together >>,

my information was that the red stone is Durga SAligrAma. But I was not
sure of its authenticity. That it is Srichakra—Is it from reliable source?
Just for my clarification and assurance.
