Shiva, Vishnu and Devi - Sringeri

During abhisheka in Sringeri the Shiva sphatika Linga, a salagrama and
Srichakra (red object seen on the plate in the image below) are kept
together. This symbolises Shiva, Vishnu and Devi identity. The Padmapurana
in the Bhagavatam 12 skandha mahatmyam says 'he is a great Vaishnava who
holds the three said above to be Brahman and does not see them as
different.'

Vamshidhara, a commentator of the Bhagavatam, has cited the verse from the
Padmapurana (see image below).

Sri Appayya Dikshitar in his Ratna Traya Pariksha has given evidence from
several scriptural texts for the Parabrahman nature of the divine Trinity.
