A Vedantin’s commentary to the Shiva Sahasra Nama – a short selection

Here (in the article) is an image from NilakanTha’s commentary to the Shiva
Sahasra Nama of the Mahabharata. Just two names are highlighted:
वृक्षकर्णस्थितिः  and विष्णुप्रसादितः.  The first cited name has a fund of
Vedantic import. It is about the tree of samsara that keeps thriving in the
face of continued ignorance. If one gets the liberating knowledge, the
samsara tree ceases. The one who keeps the tree thriving and the one who
puts an end to it is the same power: Shiva. The second name is recalling
the incident where Vishnu worshiped Shiva and pleased the latter and
obtained the Chakra. This incident is alluded to in the Harivamsha too.
