Although the meaning of the shloka is somehow clear and एवकार has these
above possibilities, this verse seems challenging to me to make a complete
anvaya. I looked up not only the previous and later few shlokas to connect,
but then the entire work itself for the sheer beauty of it. Grammatically,
this is one of the few difficult verses in it. Now, I think the following
makes some sense to me, though I am still not comfortable with all the
cases:
यथा शब्दस्य आद्यन्तयोः सत्योः मध्ये च [भ्रमत्वं] सिद्धं तथैव मनसोपि
[भ्रमत्वं] सिद्धम्। तदेव [ब्रह्म मनसः] साक्षितया नित्यम्। [अतः] त्वं भ्रमं
जहि।

I am taking एवकार with तत् since तत्त्वमसि has gone by a couple of shlokas
back. I'd appreciate if anyone offers a better anvaya.

Thanks,
