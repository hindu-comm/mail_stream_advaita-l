Namaste Bhaskar ji
We have discussed this many times in the past, and we know each other's
positions well also.

In the statement jIvo brahmaiva nApara:, the term jIva is referring to the
upalakshya chaitanya, with mind or avidyA as the upalakshaNa.

The term jagat in the statement jaganmithyA, refers to the sthUla sUkshma
kAraNa prapancha, which again, is the upalakshaNa for chaitanya.

In both cases, the upalakshaNa is mithyA, and the upalakshya is satya.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
