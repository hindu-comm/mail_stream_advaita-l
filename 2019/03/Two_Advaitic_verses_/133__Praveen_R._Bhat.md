Sadaji,

अव्यक्तादीनि भूतानि व्यक्तमध्यानि भारत।
अव्यक्तनिधनान्येव तत्र का परिदेवना॥

Subbuji,

Mandukya itself deals with the first part as well when it says that the
akAra, ukAra and makAra are sequentially born of amAtra and they resolve
into it. And as known, its not only about padakShara but padArthas too,
vyaShTi, samaShTi inclusive.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
