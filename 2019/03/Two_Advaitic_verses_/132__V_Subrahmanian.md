Thank you Sada ji, for reminding about this shloka.  It is aptly similar to
the Karika verse I cited:

अव्यक्तादीनि भूतानि व्यक्तमध्यानि भारत ।
अव्यक्तनिधनान्येव तत्र का परिदेवना ॥ २८ ॥
 भाष्यम्

 परिदेवना
अव्यक्तादीनि अव्यक्तम् अदर्शनम् अनुपलब्धिः आदिः येषां भूतानां
पुत्रमित्रादिकार्यकरणसङ्घातात्मकानां तानि अव्यक्तादीनि भूतानि
प्रागुत्पत्तेः, उत्पन्नानि च प्राङ्मरणात् व्यक्तमध्यानि । अव्यक्तनिधनान्येव
पुनः अव्यक्तम् अदर्शनं निधनं मरणं येषां तानि अव्यक्तनिधनानि ।
मरणादूर्ध्वमप्यव्यक्ततामेव प्रतिपद्यन्ते इत्यर्थः । तथा चोक्तम् —
‘अदर्शनादापतितः पुनश्चादर्शनं गतः । नासौ तव न तस्य त्वं वृथा का परिदेवना’ (मो.
ध. १७४ । १७) इति । तत्र का परिदेवना को वा प्रलापः
अदृष्टदृष्टप्रनष्टभ्रान्तिभूतेषु भूतेष्वित्यर्थः ॥ २८ ॥

*English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami
Gambirananda*

2.28 It is not reasonable to grieve even for beings which are constituted
by bodies and organs, since 'all beings remain unmanifest' etc. (Bharata, O
descendant of Bharata;) bhutani, all beings, avyaktaduni, remain unmainfest
in the beginning. Those beings, viz sons, friends, and others, constituted
by bodies and organs, [Another reading is karya-karana-sanghata, aggregates
formed by material elements acting as causes and effects.-Tr.] who before
their origination have unmanifestedness (avyakta), invisibility,
nonperception, as their beginning (adi) are avyaktaadini. Ca, and; after
origination, before death, they become vyakta-madhyani, manifest in the
middle. Again, they eva, certainly; become avyakta-nidhanani, unmanifest
after death. Those which have unmanifestness (avyakta), invisibility, as
their death (nidhana) are avyakta-nidhanani. The idea is that even after
death they verily attain unmanifestedness. Accordingly has it been said:
'They emerged from invisibility, and have gone back to invisibility. They
are not yours, nor are you theirs. What is this fruitless lamentation!'
(Mbh. St. 2.13). Ka, what; paridevana, lamentation, or what prattle, can
there be; tatra, with regard to them, i.e. with regard to beings which are
objects of delusion, which are invisible, (become) visible, (and then) get
destroyed!
