Namaste Raghav Ji,

Reg  << jagat is kAryam and Brahman is kAraNam, and applying
karyakAraNa-ananyatva-nyAya, jagat is non-separate from its adhiSThAnam
viz., brahman.  Like even a pot is clay being always non-separate from its
substratum, can we make the statement jagat is (kAraNa-dRShtyA) brahman?
(Since jagan-mithyAtvam and (kAryasya) jagatah kAraNa-ananyatvaM mean the
same. ) >>,

Perhaps my response corresponds to what Sri Subrahmanian Ji has brought out
in his reply. I only wanted to draw your attention to the first sentence
above. You have mentioned  BOTH  kAryam-kAraNam and adhiSThanam-adhyArOpa
 (word missing in your sentence, but added by me for completion)
relationship between jagat and Brahman. You are free  to select  one of
them only. They are not synonymous.

You have also referred to clay-pot relationship. The dundubhi-veena-shankha
illustration in BU is on par with the clay-gold-iron illustration in CU.
But the Bhashya on BU is far more elaborate especially on the significance
of three drishtAntas  (illustrations)  in for a one nad the same
dArshtAnta.  Another advantage is its extensive coverage by Swami
Sureswaracharya  in his vArtika on BUB.  BUBV  2-4-286 to 302 refers. Verse
294 is a quote from Upadesha Sahasri while verse 295 is a quote from CU.
Conclusion in verse 302

<< बोधाविशेषादथवा भेद एव न विध्यते ॥

कार्यकारणयोस्तत्त्वमुभयोरविलक्षणम् ॥ >>

<< bodhAvisheShAdathavA bheda eva na vidhyate ||

kAryakAraNayostattvamubhayoravilakShaNam || >>.

That Brahman is kArya-kAraNa vilakshaNa is no doubt found in most of the
Upanishads. However since you specifically mentioned pot-clay illustration
in this regard, and of course this topic has been discussed any number of
times here, I thought of bringing to your attention the BU context.

Sorry for this interruption in your discussion. This post is only for
information. May be made use of as deemed fit.

Regards
