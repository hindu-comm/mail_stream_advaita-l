In the first Sloka, if the anvaya of तदेव is done with नित्यं, as in नित्यं तदेव then the eva-kAra can be indicative of jagan mithyA also.

If that alone is nitya, ergo, the rest are not nitya, and hence mithyA.

>  Just could not resist, jihvA chApalyaM 😊 the nityatvaM has been attributed to parApara prakruti as well, the synonym used for mAya / prakruti is aksharaM and the same has been used to indicate brahman as well, hence prakruti / mAya is pariNAmi nitya.  It is there with Ishwara before and after dissolution in avyakta / avyAkruta rUpa and it is there even now in vyakta / vyAkruta rUpa.  (avyaktAdeeni bhUtAni, vyakta madhyAni and again avyakta nidhnAnaiva says lord..So, this is pariNAmi nitya jagat can not be mithyA it is pariNAmi nitya only.  If at all we say this jagat what we perceiving through our mind is mithyA then that perceiving mind itself mithyA  or does not exist like external objects.  And without mind (upAdhi) we cannot imagine jeevatvaM as well, so jeeva here is also mithyA or talamalanAdi parikalpitaM.  We have either one of the  options here I reckon, you have to agree both jeeva and jagat mithyA or both jeeva and jagat in their kAraNa rUpameva satyaM.  We cannot say one is satya another is mithyA when both are external objects only.  You know all this, but I am tempted to say this again 😊

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
