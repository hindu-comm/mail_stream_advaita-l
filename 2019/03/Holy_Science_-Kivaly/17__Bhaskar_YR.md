If I am not wrong, in the kriya yOga tradition there is a belief that it's founder ever youth bAbAji ( chiranjeevi and youth like 18 year old always) has given the lriya yOga deeksha to even shankara bhagavatpAda.  I read this somewhere, perhaps in 'Autobiography of a yogi' ?? not sure.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Dear Freinds,
                        Here is the Link of a wonderful book 'Holy Science', by Swami Pryinath Karar i.e Sh. Yukteswar Giri.

Interestingly, Sri Yukteswar did not expect the general reader to understand everything he writes. At the end of his Introduction he explains:“So far as the magnetic properties are concerned, it may be remembered that the grasping power of the human intellect, as it presently stands, is so limited.
However, sincere all people are not the seekers of truth ,They may get a much deeper understanding of Sri Yukteswar’s cosmic message. It is, after all, Babaji’s wish that The Holy Science contributes to bridge the differences between the religions of East and West.In the Foreword, Mr.Atul Chandra Chowdhary presents his “spiritual preceptor” Sri Yukteswar not by his name, but lovingly as “sadhu-sabha-pati,” which means “father of Sadhu-Sabha.” Sadhu Sabha was Sri Yukteswar’s organization, which means “Society of Saints".
