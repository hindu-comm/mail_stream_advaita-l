Namaste Sri Subrahmanianji for the Link of Sanskrit terms.
 As I could not learn Sanskrit, I have  been looking for some 'screen readable document' like the one in the link. 
Can someone in our group help by down loading the entire document and give a provision so that I can type the first few letters of the Sanskrit word / term  in normal English alphabets and get its Sanskrit meaning?

If it is possible please mail me the requested document after downloading and giving a provision for going to the required Sanskrit term. My mail ID is 'saipadukajk at gmail.com'.


Regards,
Jayakumar

Glossary of Sanskrit Terms

 One can navigate to all alphabets.  Could be useful for students of Vedanta.
