Shankara has said: स्यात्परमेश्वरस्यापि इच्छावशात् मायामयं रूपं
साधकानुग्रहार्थम् । (1.1.vii.20) (Ishwara, out of compassion, takes on, *by
His Maya*, a form to grace the spiritual aspirant.)

[The context in the BSB is that Brahman is devoid of any form but takes up
forms to help the aspirant.  In the Kenopanishad bhashya too Shankara lists
several deities Vishnu, Ishvara, Indra, Prana, etc. as upasya as Brahman]

Thus, upasana, anugraha, etc. in the realm of vyvaharika is quite valid.
