Namaste,

As guru's anugraha dawns on mumukshu, he will come to understand that these personified gods are product of 'adhyAsa'. 

Till he realises and becomes jivanmukta, he shouldn't teach others about these aspects as it leads to 'ubhayabhraSTavta' because 
a blind is leading another blind.

rgs,
sriram

  > well, does it mean finally being an
 advaitin you have to eradicate the very concept of
 existence of personified gods like hari (vishNu), hara,
 bhagavati and their respective abode like vaikunTa, kailAsa
 etc.??
