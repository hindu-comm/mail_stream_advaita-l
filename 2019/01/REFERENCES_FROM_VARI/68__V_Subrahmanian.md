That is beside the matter.

He has cited pramanas only, from shruti and smriti.

The above pramana is cited by Ramanuja. If you say Puranas are mutilated,
you should never rely on puranas and even Mahabharata which Madhva admitted
is mutilated. Also Jayanta Bhatta has cited shruti pramana too, as seen
below. So, your balAbala argument holds no water.

These are all only a personal opinion and hardly qualifies to be 'well'
addressed.

It applies to all including the link you have provided above who had only
to labor hard to present 'their' view of a shruti/smriti passage.

I get the idea from Madhva's commentary in the BG where he says 'Prakriti
is Brahman's bhAryA'. Only human-like persons can have bhAryA. A Tattva
cannot have any relationship with anything/anyone. The Tattvam is asanga.
Brahman has son (aniruddha, brahmaa), grandson (pradyumna?, shiva), etc. as
per non-advaitins. Advaitins do not take puranic pictorial descriptions as
literal.

See above.
