Dear Subbu-ji,

////////////

The point is when a person who is a beginner in Advaita is exposed to bigoted positions of Vaishnavas
denigrating Shiva, Devi, etc. and the branding of puranas as taamasic and
that too by saying that they will go to hell, and if his Ishta devata is
Shiva or any other which is not Vishnu, or his sampradaya is so, there will
be confusion caused in his mind as to what the correct position is. The
problem is aggravated when even Shankara and other early Advaitins are
misrepresented by Vaishnavas.

I know to whom you are giving counters and doing an excellent work for advaitins.  However, 
there is every danger of getting entangled in rAga & dvEsha towards the vaishnava blogger ! 

Infact, I would also request the vaishnava blogger (narayanastra) to stop this nonsense of 
mudslinging on advaita from this platform and ponder on doing some constructive work for
sanAtana dharma.  

The need of the hour is countering dalit literature & brahmin bashing literature.  The 
other day, I received a link of a website from a noted scholar about this horrible literature
being circulated.  Just have a look :

Hindus & brahmins are being exposed this way and we are discussing about the superiority of Hari & Hara !

What an irony !

sriram
