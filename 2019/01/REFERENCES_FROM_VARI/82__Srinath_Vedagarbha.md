Probably I was not explicit in my earlier posting. Dvaitins are not against
worshiping Shiva/Rudra. In fact, dvaitins do worship. There are ton of
haridaasa kirthan-s on Mahadeva.

I am not against you worshiping Shiva with bilwa patra-s. As per vEdic
pramANa, we do accept 'sarva dEva namaskaaraH kEShavaM pratigachchati' . It
is a fact that your pUja reaches Keshava with or without you aware of it.
There is no prayOjana in being ill-mouth on us and equating duelists with
Christians/Muslims.

Peace.
