He must have composed that verse but a commentary cites the Vishnu puranam
verse that is of the same meaning. So, the concept is prAmANika.

All people do not see the above Rg veda passage in the same way. Hence, it
cannot be said to be bAdhaka.

These expressions are only to give a personified touch to the

There are standard vyutpatti-s for 'Purusha' - pUrNatvAt puruSha, puri
(dehe) shayanAt puruSha, sarvam pUrayati iti puruSha, etc. So, it is not
any gender-specific term.
