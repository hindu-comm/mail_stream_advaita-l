This is very true. In Advaita, that which is beyond avyakta (maya/Ishvara)
is Turiya. So, if the narayana in this shloka is said to be a deity, then
it is not the correct portrayal of Vedanta. The deity is very much within
creation, avyakta. This corresponds to the 6th mantra of the Mandukya
Upanishad where Ishwara is described, which is the previous one to the 7th
where Turiya is described as nAntaH prajnam.... prapanchopashamam shAntam
shivam Advaitam...Many non-advaitins cite this opening verse of Shankara's
BG bhashya and conclude/claim that he was a vaishnava.
