Do not forget -- NB is both nirAkAra and nirviShEsha -- Brahman is devoid
of any form but may takes up forms, but he cannot have any guNa of "out of
compassion" (sic). Also NB is nIShkriya  so as you to speak "to grace" etc.

But such vyavahArika Ishwara is upAsanArtham and not real. Hence he cannot
possibly have any real action of "to grace the spiritual aspirant".

You are mixing vyavahara with paramArtha by saying two terms "Ishwara"
(which is vyvahAra) with "advaitavAsanA" (which is pAramArthika)
