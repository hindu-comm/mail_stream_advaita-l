Namaste,

For we advaitins, it is immaterial whether Shiva is great or Vishnu is great; for us it is 'मायाशबल ब्रह्म' ...

Yes, for personal worship, one can consider मायाशबल ब्रह्म to be Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Vishnu, Devi etc. 
and in due course of vedanta-chintana, one has to drop-off this अभिनिवेशः and transcend the 
petty aspects ....

That is why during 'vedanta-chintana', one is advised to shake off all his previously acquired concepts 

rgs,
sriram
