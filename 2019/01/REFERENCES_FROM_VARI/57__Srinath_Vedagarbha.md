Not true.

Sankara in his Hari stuti (37 verse) says;

  sattAmAtram kevalavijnAnamajam sat
  sUkShmam nityam tattvamasItyAtmasutAya
  sAmnAmante prAha pitA yam vibhumAdyam
  tam samsAradhvAntavinASam harimIDe   || 37 ||

  Rough translation --
   In the Chandogya Upanishad, the father Uddalaka told his son Svetaketu,
"tat tvam asi", "you are Brahman." This (Brahman)
  is sattAmAtram(pure existence) , kevala-vijnAnam (pure consciousness),
sUkshmam (beyond the reach of the senses), sat, real, nityam,
  eternal and It is (none other than) Hari, the destroyer of the darkness
that is this empirical existence.

Thus it is clear here that Shankara identifies Hari with the Brahman of the
Upanishads.

What you say is false unless you reject Hari stuti is by Shankara.
