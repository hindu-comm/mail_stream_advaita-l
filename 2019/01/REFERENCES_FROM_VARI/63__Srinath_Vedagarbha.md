That is not correct translation. Even going by "english" translation at
sacred-texts.com, Rv 7.40.5 says --

"With offerings I propitiate the branches of this swift-moving God, the
bounteous Visnu. Hence Rudra gained his Rudra-strength: O Asvins, ye sought
the house that hath celestial viands."

If you were to pada-chEda tnaslation;

asya devasya mILhuSo vayA viShNoreShasya prabhR^ithe havirbhiH |
vide hi rudro rudriyaM mahitvaM yAsiSTaM vartirashvinAvirAvat.h || (Rig
Veda 7:40:5)

"Asya devasya viShNoH" (Of this dEva, Vishnu) -- All in shaShThivibhakti.
"mILhuShaH" -- from the dhatu 'mih' which means 'to bestow',
"vayA"  -- from the root 'vaya' means bandhana, hence the word 'vayA'
meaning 'bandhaka' (one who causes us to be bound),
"prabhR^ite havirbhiH"  -- by devoted  offerings in the sacrifice
"vide" = lebhe (obtained)
"hi" = indeed,
"rudro" = rudra,
"rudriyaM mahatvaM" = the glory associated with rudra.

Then this verse proceeds to link the above in reference to Ashvini
devataas. Thus, By offerings with extreme devotion (pra-bhR^ithe) to this
deva, viShNu, who is very bestowful, rudra obtained the glory that is
associated with him (rudriyaM mahatvaM)

Your translation of Rudra bestows upon us the bliss of Rudra is quite wrong.

In that case Atharvashikha upanishad must be contradicting RV 7.40.5 above.
Either one is true -- both RV and AtharAtharvashikha upanishad are invalid
(as both contradict), or the 'Shambhu' mention in that Upanishad is not
same as Rudra of RV.

This does not establish Hari-Hara abhEda. It only says phala is either
Vishnu or Shankara. Do not forget in the final verdict of vEda -- sarva
dEva namaskAraha kEShvam pratigacchati

Again all porushEya texts must be interpreted inline with apouruEya vEda.
Otherwise they will be rendered invalid.

That indeed, a laborious understanding.

Shruti itself has given us straight forward understanding for the term "ApO
nArAha" ;

"ApO nArAha iti proktAha ApO vai nara-soonavaha |  ayanam tasya tAha
poorvam tEna nArAyaNa smritaha"
(Waters are said to be nArAha.  They are indeed the creation of nara.  They
are at the beginning the abode of It.  Therefore, it is NArAyaNa)

Other shrutis also convey same idea -- ambhasyapArE bhuvanasya madhyE
nAkasya prshTe mahatO maheeyAn
(The greatest of the great resides in the waters)

It is your personal opinion, not valid argument.

Otherwise risk of loosing your pramANa.

That is not valid argument. Bhashya-s may have written to indicate nEti
nEti, or the absence of negative idea. Never to say NB is 'iti' type.

Ok then -- if vyapya jagat is taken out of equation, vyApakatva shabda
'vishNu' also to be taken out. Then why are you saying vishNu shabda refers
to NB?

Either say vishNu word refers to SB or say vyapya jagat is mithya and not
try to say anything about NB. Your illogical stance is quite glaring.

Why not? See above.
