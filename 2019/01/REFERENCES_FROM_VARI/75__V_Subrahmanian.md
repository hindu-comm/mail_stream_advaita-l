Not all who have come after 13th century have accepted the 'samanvaya' that
you have stated. Those who lived in the 13th Century like Narayanashrama,
Amalananda, Shankaranandanda, etc. who have written on Upanishads like
Atharva shikha and Advaitic works have not subscribed to any particular
samanvaya you talk about. Sayana, Vidyaranya, Appayya Dikshita, etc. who
came post-13th Century too did not get influenced by the above samanvaya.
They had their own samanvaya. The upakrama, etc. lingas that you talk about
below is also known to everyone and hence that does not clinch the issue.

Here itself is the problem raising its head. The 'creator' of the jagat,
you have concluded, is a 'who', a person and not a Tattva. And about the
'process' of creation.  For Advaitins it is not some'one' sitting or
standing or lying down somewhere physically engaging in any creation
process. So, all the following passages take a different dimension
altogether.

Shankara cites a Shiva purana verse that gives the yogikArtha for the term
'Rudra' while commenting on the name 'Rudra (114) of the Vishnu Sahasra
nAma. Ironically, this yogikArtha verse on Rudra concludes: tasmAt shivaH
parama kAraNam.  So, for Shankara, the Vishnu of the VSN is not a
particular person who has different features, wife, location, etc. from
another person who has different features, etc.

Others are capable of giving quite contrary interpretations, meanings,
derivations, etc. to the ones you speak of above. If you say Rudra/Shiva is
full of flaws and only Narayana/vishnu is flawless, there are others who
can say and said otherwise. On 'narayana' shabdArtha, someone has written a
paper on how that word applies to Shiva. So, it is only a good knowledge of
vyakarana that is required to give what interpretation one wants to. In
fact narayana himself addresses shiva as narayana. The weak excuses that he
is addressing the antaryami of shiva, praising only himself, etc. are only
laughable and will delight manda mati-s and not serious tattva chintaka-s.
For, tattva transcends persons.

Beauty lies in brevity. Jayantha Bhatta conveyed what he wanted in the most
minimum words. For him the pramanas he cited speak for themselves, and do
not need lengthy explanations. So with advaita Acharyas who have commented
on those pramanas. Only to deny that one has to labor hard, write volumes
and go on and on
