In Advaita when it is admitted that NB will take a form out of mAyA, the
various attributes too come along with the form. It is not just for showing
the form, it is taken.

All this happens just as it when we invoke Vishnu  or any other devata
buddhi in a saligrama or any other image. When such a buddhi is had, the
prayer to that form/devata is valid and the anugraha that comes as a result
is also valid.  'pratimAyAm tu sAnnidhyam archakasya tapobalAt' is an added
pramANa.

Since you are not aware of the methods of Advaita with regard to devata
rupa and Ishwara pranidhAna you are finding this strange.
