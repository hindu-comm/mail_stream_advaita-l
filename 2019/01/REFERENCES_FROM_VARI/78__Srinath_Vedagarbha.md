Who exactly you mean by 'Ishvara' here?

Do you mean Isharava as saguNa brahman? or do you mean Ishvara as a
kshatriya king (following Shankara's reading of gIta verse 'IshvarOaham...'
)?

If it is former, do not forget Shankara said Ishvara is only for
upAsanartham and not real. Such illusory Ishrvara cannot bestow anything to
anybody, let alone advaita vaasana. On the contrary if you disagree that
Ishvara is illusory, then there is no question of advaita anymore let alone
its vaasana to be bestowed on anybody.

If it is later, there are any kshatriya kings anywhere. Our PMs and
Presidents cannot even support themselves in the election, let alone
bestowing advaita vaasana to anybody.
