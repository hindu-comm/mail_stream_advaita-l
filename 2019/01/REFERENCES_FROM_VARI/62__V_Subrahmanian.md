This is an English translation of the above mantra:

Rig Veda 7.40.5:

Rudra is mentioned along with a litany of other deities in Rig Veda 7.40.5.
Here is the reference to Rudra, whose name appears as one of many gods who
are called upon:

अस्य देवस्य मीळ्हुषो वया विष्णोरेषस्य परभ्र्थे हविर्भिः |
विदे हि रुद्रो रुद्रियं महित्वं यासिष्टं वर्तिरश्विनाविरावत ||

“ This Varuna, the leader of the rite, and the royal Mitra and Aryaman,
uphold my acts, and the divine unopposed Aditi,earnestly invoked: may they
convey us safe beyond evil. I propitiate with oblations the ramifications
(vayāh) of that divine attainable Vishnu, the showerer of benefits. Rudra,
bestow upon us the magnificence of his nature. The Aśvins have come down to
our dwelling abounding with (sacrificial) food. “

The Sayana Bhashya for the above is available here as an image:

http://www.mediafire.com/file/u69j957wdppskxg/asya_devasya.png/file

The bhashya for the sentence/portion of the 'asya devasya...' where occurs
' **rudro rudriyaM***  is: 'रुद्रः देवः रुद्रियं रुद्रसम्बन्धि सुखं महित्वं
महत्त्वं च विदे हि अस्मान् प्रापयति खलु | [Rudra bestows upon us the bliss
of Rudra]  Thus, this mantra does not lend any support whatsoever for
Vishnu sarvottamatva.

//Hara does not fit for that qualification as the 'remover' because
saakshAt Hara Himslef said “ahaM bhogaprado vatsA, mokShadastu janArdanaH
', Who are you to dispute that?//

The Vedas and Veda Vyasa have disputed that immensely. There is the
Atharvashikha upanishad, cited by Ramanuja and also commented upon by
Advaitin Acharyas in 13 century CE which says 'the trimurtis are born from
Shambhu'.  Jayantha Bhatta has cited from this Upanishad. Any amount of
trickery to convert 'shambhu' to Vishnu will not succeed. Also in the
Mahabharatha Veda Vyasa has penned a dialogue where Krishna without mincing
words says 'worship of Vishnu and Rudra lead to the same result':
https://adbhutam.wordpress.com/2017/04/24/worship-of-shiva-or-vishnu-lead-to-the-same-result-mahabharata/
   One can read the dialogue here.

In the Mahabharata, Ashvamedha parvan, there is a dialogue between Krishna
and Yudhishthira on the ‘vaishnava dharma shāstra’:

All these verses are also found in the Kumbhaghoṇam (Madhva) edition too:

http://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/mbhK/unic/mbhK14_sa.html

Whoever on the Chaturdashī, gives himself up in devotion to My (Vishnu’s)
form or to the form of Rudra-Dakshināmūrti, will be worshiped by the
siddha-s, brahmaṛṣi-s and the devaloka-s and praised by the gandharva-s and
the bhūta-groups, he, such a devotee is Mahātapāḥ. Such a devotee endowed
with great Tejas will be united with Me or Shankara; he will be freed from
rebirth. No doubt need to be had in this, O Yudhishtira!

Thus, we have Veda Vyasa and Krishna's words to contradict or dispute your
claim.

It is not a result of interpretation of Manu smriti. It is based on
'upAdAna kAraNa - kArya ananyatva' of Brahasutra and the Chandogya 6th
chapter. . Narayana is the source from which the pancha bhutas emerge. The
bhautika prapancha is thus a vivarta of Narayana.

There is no basis for the above story. It has been told too many times so
as to lose all credibility. The 'Na-kAra' aspect is laughable. For
Narayana, Shiva is 'Narayana'. Read an article here:
https://adbhutam.wordpress.com/2018/02/24/shiva-is-narayana-for-narayana/

Here is another instance of the name ‘Narayana’ applied to someone other
than Vishnu.  The Lingapurana has a stuti by Vishnu and other gods and
sages addressed to Shiva:
https://sa.wikisource.org/s/4ij
तपसा प्राप्य सर्वज्ञं तुष्टाव पुरुषोत्तमः।।
श्रीभगवानुवाच।।
महेश्वराय देवाय नमस्ते परमात्मने।। ७१.९६ ।।

नारायणाय शर्वाय ब्रह्मणे ब्रह्मरूपिणे।।
शाश्वताय ह्यनंताय अव्यक्ताय च ते नमः।। ७१.९७ ।।
Lord Vishnu, along with other gods and sages, observing austerities, tapas,
approached Lord Umapati.  Vishnu himself addresses Shiva as: ‘Maheshwara,
Deva, Paramatman, Narayana,

Sharva, Brahman, Brahmarupin, Shaashvata, Ananta, Avyakta, Obeisance to You.

'Narayana' is used for BrahmA too.

The above is not a correct understanding of Advaita. If that were the case,
no bhashya would have been written for the upanishads, etc.

They are not guna-s of Brahman. With reference to the world, Brahman is
adhisthanam. Since world is mithya, the adhishthanatva is also not real. So
with vyapakatva. Only if vyapya jagat is admitted, Brahman is said to be
vyapaka.

These are non-issues.
