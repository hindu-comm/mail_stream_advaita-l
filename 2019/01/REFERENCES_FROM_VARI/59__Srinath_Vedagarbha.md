That may be the position for Shankara, but Hari shabda, by its yogIka artha
denotes only Vishnu (harithi iti hariH). Also per nArayaNAya vidmaye
vAasudevAya
dhimahi tanno vishNu prachodayAt . If you just say Hari is nirguNa brahman
that does not fly. Do not forget your NB is avAchya and no single shabda
denotes it.
