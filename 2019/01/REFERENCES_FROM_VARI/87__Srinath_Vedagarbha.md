Just to let you know that what Shankara dealing with here is Vedic dualists
(like Kapila etc) and not vEdAntic dualists dvaita vEdAntins. All your
analysis on Shankara's stand does not hold water for Dvaitins.

Tatvavaada/dvaitavAda of Madhva also argues based on shAstra and logical
reasoning.  Shankara's position -- dusalist are false just because they do
not base on shAstra -- is indeed on a wrong premise as for as Madhva's
doctrine is considered. Your quoting such Shanakara's passage is quite
wrong argument.

As I mentioned in my orginal mail that -- according to Dvaitins own
siddhAnta -- just like nava vaidha bhakti one needs to perform, so also
nava vida pApa-s one must avoid. Please note I am not saying such position
is right or wrong here, but simply saying "as per their own siddhAnta" they
are attempting to avoid such pApa-s (in their view) by not getting their
daughters married to a household which may compromise this pApa. If you
disagree they are not pApa, no problem, you may make that argument and that
is a different topic.

As far as most Madhvas listening to songs of an Advaitin, I cannot say
anything as I do not know them in a sense that whether they are loukiAs or
vaidIkas etc. As I said earlier, I do not mind listening to sthOtra-s
praising MahadEva Shiva. It is only a issue if any sthOtras indicating
critical philosophical points such as jIvEsha abhEda etc.
