Dear Bhaskar ji,

What you say is true. Even Dr.B N K Sharma (famous author of many Dvaita
related works in English), has said in a paper published in 1931-32
'Genuine Advaitism has no quarter to give to either Shiva or Vishnu'.

Actually you have given  the reason too as to why some Advaitins take to
portray a position that might look 'bigoted'. The point is when a person
who is a beginner in Advaita is exposed to bigoted positions of Vaishnavas
denigrating Shiva, Devi, etc. and the branding of puranas as taamasic and
that too by saying that they will go to hell, and if his Ishta devata is
Shiva or any other which is not Vishnu, or his sampradaya is so, there will
be confusion caused in his mind as to what the correct position is. The
problem is aggravated when even Shankara and other early Advaitins are
misrepresented by Vaishnavas. Such a situation needs to be addressed. And
the only way for this is to counter the bigoted positions and present the
'other' position and articulate the balanced position. This alone will help
those who are on the verge of getting misguided.
