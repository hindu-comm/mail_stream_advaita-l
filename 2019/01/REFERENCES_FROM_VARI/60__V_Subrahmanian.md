For both wods Hara and Hari, the dhAtu, hr, is the same. Both words
indicate that 'harati paapaani'.  (harati is to remove, destroy, etc.)

The above is a wrong understanding. All words have etymological
derivations. In the Narayana sukta, Sayana has cited the famous verse of
the manu smriti and other puranas that give the etymological meaning of the
name 'narayana'  - Apo nArA iti proktआः..'

'आपो नारा इति प्रोक्ता आपो वै नरसूनवः ।

अयनं तस्य ताः पूर्वं तेन नारायणः स्मृतः ॥ ‘ [मनुः १.१०]
   and said that 'nArAyaNa is not any mrUrivishesha.'  Any deity can be
assigned to that definition. As per the definition, Narayana is the
adhiShThAnam of the jagat adhyasa. Hence, N is NB.  Likewise Vishnu means
that which is vyApaka. Nirguna Brahman is sarvavyApi and hence Vishnu
denotes Brahman. So with Vasudeva, etc. names.
