Such a situation needs to be addressed. And the only way for this is to counter the bigoted positions and present the 'other' position and articulate the balanced position.

Yes, what you are conveying is true.  But look at the subject heading of this thread, a Shaiva would definitely feel proud of his 'daddy' and would be audacious enough to prove hara is superior to hari since hari is wearing the symbols of hara 😊  and such a biased viewpoints (like prof. SKR's view that nowhere there is a mention that bhagavatpAda wearing the tripundra though popular photographs showing him wearing tripundra)   are definitely not an attempt of balanced view or hari-hara abedha instead it is trying to prove hara is more powerful and superior to hari, like vaishNava-s do to show hari is superior to hara.  IMHO, this is not at all necessary for the Advaita followers who needs to be taught 'abedha' right from the word go.  Anyway, it is my opinion.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Dear Bhaskar ji,

What you say is true. Even Dr.B N K Sharma (famous author of many Dvaita related works in English), has said in a paper published in 1931-32 'Genuine Advaitism has no quarter to give to either Shiva or Vishnu'.

Actually you have given  the reason too as to why some Advaitins take to portray a position that might look 'bigoted'. The point is when a person who is a beginner in Advaita is exposed to bigoted positions of Vaishnavas denigrating Shiva, Devi, etc. and the branding of puranas as taamasic and that too by saying that they will go to hell, and if his Ishta devata is Shiva or any other which is not Vishnu, or his sampradaya is so, there will be confusion caused in his mind as to what the correct position is. The problem is aggravated when even Shankara and other early Advaitins are misrepresented by Vaishnavas. Such a situation needs to be addressed. And the only way for this is to counter the bigoted positions and present the 'other' position and articulate the balanced position. This alone will help those who are on the verge of getting misguided.

warm regards
subbu
