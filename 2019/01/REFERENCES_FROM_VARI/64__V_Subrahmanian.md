The translation I have given is very close to the Sayana Bhashyam, an image
of which I have provided. I prefer to go by Sayana who is not a sectarian.

Why? That sUkta is a prayer to the various deities to bestow various things
to the seekers. Another translation, Rigved: Hindi Indology By Dr. Ganga
Sahai Sharma   https://tinyurl.com/y9mo5enw   too gives the same
translation as above.

Advaitins do not see these as contradictions. The reason is, for them
Brahman is not a paricchinna vyakti who is different from another vyakti
(vastu pariccheda). Various Vedic portions do the stuti of Rudra and Vishnu
as jagat kaaraNam too.

      The Kumbhakonam (Madhva) edition too has the word: apunarbhavam = no

I have already given the meaning of 'Keshava' = the one under whose control

The 'NakAra' episode is someone's fertile imagination and hence does not

The jagat/srishti etc. is adhyaropa by the shaastra in order to teach the
Truth. 'adhyAropa apavAdAbhyAm niShprapancham prapanchyate is a line cited
by Shankara as that of 'sampradAyavit's statement. So words are used to
denote the Truth which has nothing to do with jagat.

Your improper understanding of Advaita is what is glaring in all this.
