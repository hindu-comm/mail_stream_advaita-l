nirupapada viShEsha always denote the excellent in that class. So, if you
interpret harati pApAni, the unqualified 'pApa' indicate the highest one in
that class, that is this bandhana. Hara does not fit for that qualification
as the 'remover' because saakshAt Hara Himslef said “ahaM bhogaprado vatsA,
mokShadastu janArdanaH ', Who are you to dispute that? If you still adment
and say it is Shiva only the remover of samsAra, you cannot handle Rig vEda

adhiSThaAnaM is agreed, but where does Manusmriti says adhistana of
'adhyasa' ? It is indeed a quite laborious interpretation. If
adhyAsa-bhAshya is not laborious, what else is?

Any deity can be assigned to nArAyaNa shabda? You must be kidding, Appaya
Dixita a mahA ShaivA himself gave up on interpreting 'nArayaNa' in favor of
Shaiva due to the presence of Na-kaara and absence of na-kaara.

If you say so, two issues -- one from gramatical point of view and other
doctrinal point o view.. On the grammatical issue -- do not forget  your NB
is never vAchyArtha and always been laxyArtha only. There where is the
question of application of yOgika-artha of any word, let alone nArAyanAdi
shabdas?

On the doctrinal issue -- if you interpret in a way that NB is adhistanata
and vyApaka, then NB is no more nirguNa, as such qualifications adhisttavaM
and vyapakatvaM will render it as SB.

Should I remind you again, NB is nEti nEti. So, interpret those shabda-s in
negative term as 'non-non-supporter' or 'non-localized' etc. Remember
satyam-jnAnaM-antaM  case? Instead o interpreting straight way, the
negative way 'not-asatya, not-ajnAna, not-antam' is indeed a laborious
way.
