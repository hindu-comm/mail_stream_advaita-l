Generally why Madhvas refuse to give their daughters to Smarta family is
that of spiritual reasons. They do not want to have their daughter commit
any of the nava-vida sins during her stay at her husband's family. These
includes, but not limited to, eating on Ekadashi day, singing bhajans or
listening pravachana which are on jIvaEsha aikya subject etc. Note that I
am not arguing they are right or wrong here, but saying from Madhvas own
siddhanta perspective. On the other hand, they do not mind bringing Smarta
bride to their household. Even if such smarta daughter-in-law does fasting
on Ekadashi day, no sin as per Smartha tradition and no hard feeling for
bride's family, but fasting is good for her health I suppose.

On the other hand if the bride and groom families are not at all
spiritual/vaidIkas, then the question is mute as they are not even consider
any sampradaaya, but the label is by the virtue of their birth only. Who
cares in that case?

Your comparison is quite inappropriate. DvaitaAdvaita fighting is not based
at physical level so as to speak on who is majority.
