Did he forget balAbala of pramAna-s? When I have Rigvedic pramANa (asya

not  accepting that purana is really saying it, as we all know puranas are
quite mutilated.

These are all well addressed in Dvaita literatures. I have uploaded a

I am not sure where you got these idea. I am afraid you are not
representing your pUrvapaxa correctly.

For Dvaitin too Brhamn is a Tatvava, otherwise why the name 'Tatvavaada'?
