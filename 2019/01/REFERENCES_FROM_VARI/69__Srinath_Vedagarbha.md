He cited from shruti and smirti which are contradictory in nature. He did
not address the philosophical standpoint from them except concluding
Hari-Hara abeda, that too when he has a glaring bAdaka from Rgvedic asya
devasya mILhuSo vayA  pramANa.

I did not say ALL puranas are mutilated. A given puranic verse may or may
not be mutilated, but Shruti takes the precedence when there is a viRodha
in the specific context.

No he did not, he forgot to take asya devasya mILhuSo.. shruti into the
equation.

Please read it, the author quoting shruti/smriti passages in addressing
pUrvapaxa objections. I wonder you didn't even opened that book.

Even your Shankara said in Soundryalahari parabrahman has pattamahiShi, so?

prakriti, bhArya, stree, yOni etc are all vydIka shabda-s. They need to be
understood in that context. Your (ill) understanding of bhArya is only
meant to be a human wife, is quite questionable on your schooling.

When shruti says 'jagat prasUti'  are you going to say because the word
"prasUti" is there, that tatva went to  maternity hospital (prasUti-gruha)
or called midwife? If not why not?

When purusha sUkta calls Brahman as 'purUSha', are you going to say Brahman
is a purusha (and not stree) as in mundane language? If not why not?

Your objections, which are based on silly understanding of pUrva paxa is
not worthy of addressing.
