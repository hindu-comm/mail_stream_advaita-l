For the name 'Keśava'  in the Vishnu Sahasra nama - Shankaracharya,
alternatively, has given an etymological meaning: कश्च अश्च ईशश्च
त्रिमूर्तयः केशास्ते यद्वशेन वर्तन्ते स केशवः ।

[Brahmā, Vishnu and Shiva are the trimūrti-s - all of whom are under the
control of that entity which is called Keśava.]

According to this, all worship done to all deities, including Vishnu,
reaches 'Keshava', the Turiya Brahman, which is above the Trimurti-s.

There is a similar etymological explanation for the name 'Trayambaka'
too: त्रयाणां
ब्रह्मविष्णुरुद्राणाम् अम्बकं पितरम् - ie., the father of Brahma, Vishnu &
Rudra. [The Sayana Bhashya for the Rg.Veda mantra is attached. 59th सूक्तं
of 7th मण्डलं from ऋग्वेदः .. The Rsi for this sUkta is मैत्रवरुणिः वसिष्ठः
].

This 'Trayambaka' is again, the Turiya Brahman, beyond the Trimurti-s.

An Amarakosha Bhashya by Lingayasuri 12th Century, too gives both the above
derivations.
