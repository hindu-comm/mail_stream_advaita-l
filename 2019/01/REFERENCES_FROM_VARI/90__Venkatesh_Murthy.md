This is the tragedy. Instead of thinking all of us Smartas, Madhvas and
Srivaishnavas are Brahmins only we are fighting ourselves.

My wife comes from Madhva family. Recently she came across her friend's
Madhva brother in law is thrashing his daughter because she is loving a
Smarta boy. He is preventing the marriage. She went with her friend and
told them. 'Stop behaving like your daughter is marrying a SC/ST man or
Muslim or Christian. She is marrying a Brahmin only. Be happy'.

This is like Muslim tactics. They will attract and marry Hindu girls in
love Jihad and convert them to Muslim and when they give birth the Muslim
population will increase. But they will not give Muslim girls to Hindus
because they want Hindu population to not increase.
