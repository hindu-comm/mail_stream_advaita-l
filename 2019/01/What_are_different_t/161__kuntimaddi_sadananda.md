PraNAms to everybody.



We just completed the second Chapter of Vedanta Sangraha of Shree Ramaraya Kavi. The third chapter starts withadhyaasa.

As a scientist, he first starts classification of types ofadhyaasa.

arthaadhyaasaandjnaanaadhyaasa.

with further classifications as Kaaryaadhyaasa and kaaraNaadhyaasa.

There are some other classificationsas

Swaruupa adhyaasa and samsarga adhyaasa

Dharma adhyaasa and dharmi adhyaasa.

sOpaadika adhyaasa and nirupaadika adhyaasa

some are relatable to khyaati vaadas.

Without getting confused with these names, what are differenttypes adhyaasasand how one can explain these in simple and understandable language? 



Hari Om!
