 Namaste Sadaji,From what I understand:1) arthAdhyAsa and jnAnAdhyAsa - the superimposed object is arthAdhyAsa (rope-snake), and the cognition of which is jnAnAdhyAsa (rope-snake knowledge).2) kAryAdhyAsa and kAraNAdhyAsa - the superimposition of primal ignorance (which is jagat upAdAna kAraNa) on brahman is kAraNAdhyAsa. The superimposition of the world on Brahman due to that primal ignorance is kAryAdhyAsa.3) svarUpAdhyAsa and samsargAdhyAsa- the superimposition of the svarUpa / the thing-itself on another (a snake on a rope) is svarUpAdhyAsa, whereas the imposition of the attributes of a thing on another is samsargAdhyAsa (the redness of a flower superimposed on crystal).4) nirupAdhika and sopAdhika - the upAdhi, in this context, means that which lends / transfers the attributes of itself (AdhIyate svadharma: yena) to that which is near (upa samIpe). The flower is the upAdhi in the adhyAsa of redness in the crystal, so the red crystal is a case of sopAdhika adhyAsa. nirupAdhika adhyAsa is where an upAdhi is not present, but the adhyAsa takes place anyway because the substratum is not clearly understood / perceived, like the rope-snake. The nirupAdhika adhyAsa will disappear with the knowledge of the substratum, whereas the sopAdhika adhyAsa will persist so long as the upAdhi is present nearby, ie even with the knowledge of the substratum. Even if it is known that the crystal is colourless, as long as the hibiscus is present nearby, the crystal continues to appear red.5) dharma adhyAsa and dharmi adhyAsa - the superimposition of attributes of one upon the other is dharma adhyAsa (The happiness located in the mind, superimposed on the self, as in "I am happy"), and the superimposition of one substance upon the other is dharmi adhyAsa (the thief superimposed on the pillar).

PraNAms to everybody.



We just completed the second Chapter of Vedanta Sangraha of Shree Ramaraya Kavi. The third chapter starts withadhyaasa.

As a scientist, he first starts classification of types ofadhyaasa.

arthaadhyaasaandjnaanaadhyaasa.

with further classifications as Kaaryaadhyaasa and kaaraNaadhyaasa.

There are some other classificationsas

Swaruupa adhyaasa and samsarga adhyaasa

Dharma adhyaasa and dharmi adhyaasa.

sOpaadika adhyaasa and nirupaadika adhyaasa

some are relatable to khyaati vaadas.

Without getting confused with these names, what are differenttypes adhyaasasand how one can explain these in simple and understandable language?
