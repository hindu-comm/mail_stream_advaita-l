There is lot of misunderstanding on Dvaitin's understanding regarding
Brahman. As a result one member charges Dvaitins and argues Brahman/Tatva
is rendered as vyakti in Dvaita.

Here is his claim;

I am not sure where you got these idea. I am afraid you are not

The wrong idea is quite obvious. He thinks bhAryA is only bhAryA in loukika
sense. Such wrong idea is refuted by both shruti and smiriti.

Purusha Suktha quite clearly says Purusha having patItvaM "hRiischate
lakshmiitscha patnyou', aho raatre paarshve ..." Purusha identified as
husband of hRii and Lakshmi.

In mahAvishNu-purANa, shri VedavyAsa states :

"mahAlakshmIriti parA bhAryA nArAyaNasya yA | prakritir nAma sA jnyEyA

Now, will that member accuses Purusha Sukta and VP with the same charge as
he accused Madhva?
