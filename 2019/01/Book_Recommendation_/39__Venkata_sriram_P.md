Namaste Divya ji,

Swamiji was a great personality and uttama-purusha ! 

Currently, I see Swami Tattvavidananda Saraswathi Ji as a great scholar 
and multi-faceted personality who studied shastras very deeply.  He also
completed Krishna Yajurveda Taittiriya Shakha in purva-ashrama. Holds
a Ph.D degree in Organic Chemistry and has a great passion for Science &
Technology and takes special interest in Physics and Chemistry.

rgs,
sriram
