Sri Ramakrishna was in Bhava samadhi listening to a devotional song of the vaiShnava tradition dedicated to Krishna when someone whispers the name of Goddess Kali in his ears and he responds very disapprovingly as when one eating some tasty peanuts eats a bad peanut. This was so since devotion to Kali it did not according with his feeling or rasa or mood at that time which was towards Lord Krishna.

Hare Krishna

It is because of this bhAshyakAra says the phala / anubhava will be different when you are doing the upAsana / dhyAna on different upAsya devata.  After all, the result has to differ as this is 'purusha taNtra' which can be ;kartum, akartum, anyata kartum shakyaM.  When one is getting bhAva samAdhi on Krishna there is no place to get devi related bhAva and vice versa because bhAva in which the upAsaka intensely meditated on particular deity would result in that bhAva only, for example meditate on apple you will get apple only not orange, yad bhAvaM tad bhavati  ðŸ˜Š  Hence paramahaMsa never even looked at the kAli temple in dakshineshwar when he wanted to have the darshana of Jesus the Christ ðŸ˜Š

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

Namaste Subbu ji
Thank you this.
One related issue is the lack of nuance and subtlety in the dvaita
(dualistic) mindset.

The dvaitins I have interacted , are unable to appreciate that Advaita vedAnta while emphasising the Non-dual truth of the Self, is strongly supportive of the practices of loving devotion to a personal deity - bhakti towards the iShTa Devata. Devotion to Krishna or Vishnu is wholly validated and endorsed by the teachers of Non-dual vedAnta. But Indian dualists are loathe to examine and appreciate this fact. They just can't wrap their mind around the fact that a great devotee of Sri Rama like Thyagaraja is still a staunch Advaitin. Similarly Tukaram and Jnaneshwar professional loving devotion to a personal deity viz., Vitthala, but remain Non-dualist in their understanding.

In one incident, Sri Ramakrishna was in Bhava samadhi listening to a devotional song of the vaiShnava tradition dedicated to Krishna when someone whispers the name of Goddess Kali in his ears and he responds very disapprovingly as when one eating some tasty peanuts eats a bad peanut.
This was so since devotion to Kali it did not according with his feeling or rasa or mood at that time which was towards Lord Krishna. On other days he would relate to the Goddess with the same devotion that he professed to Sri Krishna. Such 'perspectivism' with respect to bhakti is hard for the dualistic mindset to fathom.
