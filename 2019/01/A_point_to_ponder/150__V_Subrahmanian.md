A point to ponder

In the wake of discussions, often ending up in animated exchanges, in the
context of Shiva-Vishnu supremacy, here is something that appeals to our
intellect:

Great Minds Discuss Ideas; Average Minds Discuss Events; Small Minds
Discuss People.

The Advaitin alone comes out clean on the issue for he is concerned only
with the Tattvam, Truth, and does not make the mistake of conflating the
Tattvam with a person, deity.
