Birth of a Mystic Seer

Soon the happy tidings came. Lakshamma had
conceived her twelfth child. There was a special
lustre in her face. Was not a jnani, a mahapurusha,
the upholder of dharma in her womb? The highly
detached Gopala Sastri too exuded evident
happiness.

On Sunday, October 16 1892, a son was born
to this pious couple. His birth, upanayanam,
sannyasa, and videha mukti were all on Sundays.
It was the auspicious day of ashwayuja bahula
ekadasi (the eleventh day of the dark fortnight)
in the lunar year Nandana. His birth star was
Makha, second pada, and the rasi was simha. It
was in the fitness of things that this child, who
has to become a vairagya chakravarti, the
foremost amongst the dispassionate, should be
born on an ekadasi, a day marked for fasting and
prayer. The parents’ joy knew no bounds.

When this auspicious event was reported to
Sri Narasimha Bharathi Mahaswamigal, the
Acharya conveyed his blessings, knowing as he
did what role the boy was to play as an
exceptional tapasvi, whose life would be totally
surrendered to Sharadamba.

On the eleventh day the rituals of jatakarma
and namakarana, writing of horoscope and
naming, were done. The son was named ‘Sri
Narasimha.’
