Dear mumukshus,
Here is the most direct and simple way to be an Atmavit.




Who Am I? 

 I Am I.

What Am I?

SriShankara gives the answer thus in the commentary to 

mantra 2-1-10 of Kathopanishad :

"vijnAnaikarasaMnairantaryENa AkASavat 

paripUrNaMbrahmaivAhamasmi ||



Howto realize/cognize that fact "brahmaivAhamasmi ||"



SriShankara says in his commentary to mantra 

2-4of Kena Upanishad thus:

kathaM tu tadbrahma samyagviditaM Bavati? 

ityevamarthamAha- 

pratibOdhaviditaMmatam

amRutatvaM hi vindatE | 

AtmanAvindatEvIryaM

vidyayA vindatE^mRutam ||



ThusAtmajnAna was imparted by my Revered Guru. 

Iam sharing this wisdom with like-minded readers.

MAY THE INDWELLING REALITY BESTOW THIS WISDOM


Withrespectful namaskars,

SreenivasaMurthy
