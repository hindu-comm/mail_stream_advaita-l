One's true svarUpa or paramArthasvarUpa :

From an examination ofthe states of waking, dream and dreamless sleep (suShupti ) a mumukShu can ESTABLISH

 that the Self is real,

 that it transcends all the non-self(anAtma),

 that it is unalloyed (Suddhatvam), 

 that it is self-luminous,(svayaMjyOtiH)

 that it is constant and eternal ( nityatvam), 

 that its nature is unsurpassablebliss, 

 that it is a pure unity, 

 that it is Consciousness and nothingelse

 and that it is without a second.

May the mumukShus be blessed with this wisdom!




  With respectful namaskars,
 Sreenivasa Murthy
