Dear Kartik,

You will find the Suta Samhita very rewarding in your quest. it is a fine
combination of Shiva Bhakti, practices and Vedanta. It is a whole book in
simple Sanskrit verse and has a commentary by Swami Vidyaranya. You may
request a scholar to teach you this work. The book is available for
download. I have translated a part of the Upanishad section of that book to
English and is available in Advaita Academy site. You may have to navigate.

I am not sure if the entire Suta Samhita is translated into English.

Of course the Shivanandalahari of Shankaracharya also is a valuable work in
your quest. This has English translation and a Sanskrit perhaps unpublished
commentary. You can read Sri Appayya Dikshitar's several works on Shiva
Tattva.

warm regards
subbu
