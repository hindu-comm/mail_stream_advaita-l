Namaste,
I have Sri Rudram by Swami Dayananda Saraswati of Arsha Vidya gurukulam. It
has word by word Sanskrit English translation.

Another book is Sri Shiva Gita, which is a part of Padma purana.
I have Hindi Translation by Sri Nandlal Dashora available in Gita Press
stores.
Don't know if there is good English translation.

Are you looking with anything related to Shiva in any field or just Vedanta?

There are books like Thurimandiram translated by Marshall govindam, Siva
Samhita, Guru Gita, Shiva Mahimna Stotra, Linga Purana, etc.

OM
Sujal
