Namaste,

A beautiful book in sanskrit on the topic 'Sankara on Saguna Brahman' by 
Mahamahopadhyaya Vireshwara Krishna Dongre Ji.

Dongre Ji requires no introduction in our advaita circles who taught Purva Mimamsa 
& Shloka Vartika to Shri.Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamigal of Sringeri.  

Dongre Ji was the saha-adhyAyi of Mahamahopadhyaya Goda Subramanya Sastry, a great tArkika.

Here is the book to download.  May be useful for ongoing discussions.
