Dear Sada ji,

Thanks for the above mail. Your question reduces to the difference between
upadhi and avaccheda.

Drk is of four types:

1. With mAyA as upAdhi, Brahman becomes the dRk

2. With mAya as avaccheda, Ishwara is dRk.

3. With avidya as upAdhi (I assume this), kUTashtha is dRk.

4. With avidya as avaccheda, jiva is dRk.

All this four-fold difference is only aupAdhika and not real.

warm regards
subbu
