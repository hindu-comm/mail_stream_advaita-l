PraNAms to all.
I was reading the text - Vedanta Sangraha of Ramaraya Kavi with commentary by Prof. R.Balasubramanian and S.Revati, published by Chinmaya International Foundation. (Shree Subbuji had given reference to this few weeks back). I thought of taking this text in my talk series as I completed the panchadasitext.
 In the introduction to the text, Sri Balasubramanian discusses the essence of Advaita covering various concepts including Khyaati vaadas. After reading his introduction, and coming from a strong science background and also was brought up as Vishishtaadvaitin like Ramaraya Kavi, I felt the urge to talk first on ‘Why Advaita? A perspective of a Scientist’. We completed this series. There are about 17 talks; and the series will soon become available on YouTube under Acharya Sadaji, by the courtesy of Advaita Academy.I just started the talks on Vedanta Sangraha. Ramaraya Kavi starts the chapter on ‘dRisya prapacham’. With the statement that there are two entities – dRik and dRisyam or seer-seen or subject-object. In his second para, he introduces the driK entity. With the statement that there are types –dRik padaarthaH chaturvibhaH|Brahma-Iswara-kuuTastha – jeeva bhedaat|Oupaadikoyam bhedaH na taatvikaH| Next, he says:maayopahitaa dRik brahma|maayaavacchinnaatu IswaraH|
How do you interpret the above statements since Brahman is also defined with maayaa upaadhi and with Iswara asmaayaa avacchinna’. 

Will be happy to know. 

Hari Om!
