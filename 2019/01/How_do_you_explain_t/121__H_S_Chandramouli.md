Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,

Reg  << Yes to all that but I am puzzled by your statement:

"That is because Brahman is ajnAta at this level, both in the role of
Iswara as well as in the entire dRishya prapancha, and remains uncognized"



What happened to the sarvajnatvam of Iswara? >>,



Sorry if I have created confusion. What I meant is both as Iswara (this is
what I meant by ** in the role of Iswara **) and as  the entire
dRisyaprapancha Brahman  remains uncognized ( by the jIvAs). It is not
intended to mean that Brahman remains uncognized by Iswara. I hope I have
clarified.





Regards
