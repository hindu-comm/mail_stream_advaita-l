Dear Sada ji,

Thanks for the above mail. Your question reduces to the difference between
upadhi and avaccheda.

Drk is of four types:

1. With mAyA as upAdhi, Brahman becomes the dRk

2. With mAya as avaccheda, Ishwara is dRk.

3. With avidya as upAdhi (I assume this), kUTashtha is dRk.

4. With avidya as avaccheda, jiva is dRk.

All this four-fold difference is only aupAdhika and not real.

warm regards
subbu

You have provided the meaning of what it says only.
The question that boils down - In Advaita, we have Brahman- as nirguna nirupaadikapaaramaarthikaBrahman - there is no dRik-dRisyam also at that reference.
At the next level, we have sopaadikamaayaasahitaIswara as sagunaBrahman from the vyaavahaarika level.
As I see Shree Ramaya Kavi seems to differentiate the second into two. Just to see how one can explain in a self-consistent way, I have not studied the whole book yet. The talks are for my own clarity.
