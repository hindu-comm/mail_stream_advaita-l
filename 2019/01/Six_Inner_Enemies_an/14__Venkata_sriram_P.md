Namaste,

First throw away philosophies and practice the prapatti (the way to bhakti-mArga).

Then, learn sanskrit....and....study bhAgavata.

Try to dive deep into it and may be you may get the priceless pearl called 'kriSNa-bhakti'.

परोपदेशवेलायां शिष्टा: सर्वे भवन्ति वै |
विस्मरन्तीह शिष्टत्वं स्वकार्ये समुपस्थिते ||

People become intelligent to give the advice ('upadesh') to other's when they are in distress. 
But the people forget that same intelligence while they themselves are in the difficulty.

rgs,
sriram
