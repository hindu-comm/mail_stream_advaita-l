Excerpts from *Chapter 19. Nation First in the book The Multifaceted
Jivanmukta*
- *Acharyal HH Shri Abhinava  Vidyatheertha Mahaswamigal*

As per the Rāmāyaṇa, Lord Rāma said, “The mother and the motherland are
superior even to heaven.”
While having transcended the limiting senses of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ by virtue of
His realization of and
firm abidance in the non-dual Reality, His Holiness
manifested intense patriotism.

In His speeches at various places, He said that in response to the question
“Who are you?” the first thought that arises in many is of the form, “I am
a Keralite,” “I am a Punjabi,” etc. This is not how it should be. One’s
first response should be, *“I am an Indian.”* He said, “If all people feel
they are Indians first and
only then think of
any other divisions, the nation will have great prosperity and the divisive
forces will not be operative as they are today.”
He pointed out, “Since time immemorial, we have been one as a nation,
despite the fact that there were many kingdoms ruled by many monarchs of
varied dispositions. The oneness of the nation was never lost on us. *What
was the spirit that held us together? It was the underlying dharma
practised by the vast majority that unified us.* Thus, though divided by
kingdoms, we were united by the spirit of dharma."

“Non-injury is a daivī-sampat (godly attribute) in man and is opposed to
causing injury, an āsurī-sampat (demonical attribute). Non-injury is a
means to the realisation of the Absolute. In keeping with the averment,
‘ahiṁsā paramodharmaḥ,’
it is reckoned as the highest dharma. There is another injunction, ‘Put
down without hesitation.’ The two teachings should be reconciled. To the
good, cause no violence; take all precautions not to hurt their feelings.
Offend not the non-offending, overlook trifles and correct them with love.
But desperadoes
who commit arson, homicide, outrage the modesty of women and attack without
provocation deserve to be punished.

Excerpts from His Holiness’s message issued from Shivamogga on 27th
October, 1962, at the time when the Chinese had attacked India:
“Our land is wedded to peace, but a neighbour of ours mistakes it for our
weakness. China has demonically
attacked us and its forces have set foot on our sacred soil. ‘Fight,’ was
Kṛṣṇa’s message to Arjuna. Our
people, as one united force, must fight to put down
that aggression and establish peace.

“What can I give - I, who have renounced all? I
may not be useful in the battlefield. But this pīṭha
established by Śrī Ādi-Śaṅkara is replete with the power of the tapas of
sages, and from that treasure, I whole-heartedly give to our Jawans, my
blessings. May
the treasure of tapas contribute to victory. The able-bodied ones amongst
you may serve in the defence forces;
the affluent should part with their wealth to enrich the defence fund. All
should stand by our leaders and obey their behest. My prayers are with you.”

At a time when communal harmony was challenged over reports of conversions
in southern
Tamil Nadu, His Holiness issued a message to the following effect:
1. No one must act in such a way as to harm another.
2. The śāstras do not recognise conversion of a Hindu to another religion.
As such, those who have ‘changed’ their religion, if they are remorseful,
may be treated as if no change has occurred.
3. None should impose restrictions on the use of wells, places of prayer
etc., that are
meant for the use of common people. People imposing restrictions as to who
should use
these may be penalised.
4. The Śāstra says: “Dharma protects one who protects it,” and “There is
higher good in performing one’s own dharma.” These precepts should be borne
in mind and acted upon accordingly.

“Our nation and its culture have a hoary past and we should all be proud of
it. Blindly following the west is not conducive to our benefit. For
instance, caring
for aged parents has come down to us traditionally;
we must never neglect this duty by indiscriminately
aping the so-called liberal societies, wherein concern for one’s own
progenitors is at a low ebb.”
His Holiness spoke with such frankness, love and purity of heart that
wherever He went, He found
a place in the hearts of the people, regardless of whichever part of India
they were from. Every night, at the commencement of His
Candramaulīśvara-pūjā, as part of the saṅkalpa, His Holiness
supplicated the Lord for the welfare of all beings.
