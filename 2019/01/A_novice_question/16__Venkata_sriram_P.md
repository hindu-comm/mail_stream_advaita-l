........
I am in particular trying to understand the relationship between "Ishta" and "Adhideva"
....

On a lighter vein :))

Before marriage, at the time of engagement with your wife, she becomes the "iSTa-devata" 
owing to "love at first sight".

After marriage, she become your "adhi-devata". LOL ...

BTW, on a serious note...

ईश्वरो गुरुरात्मेति मूर्तिभेदविभागिने ।
व्योमवद् व्याप्तदेहाय दक्षिणामूर्तये नमः

“Salutations to Sri Dakshinamurti who is all-pervading like Space, 
but is called differently as Ishwara, Guru and Jiva because of conditioning”

rgs,
sriram
