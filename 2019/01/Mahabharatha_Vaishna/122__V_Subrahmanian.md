Here is an announcement about a 'vaishnava' recension of the Mahabharatha
brought out in multiple volumes by the Palimaru maTha,  Udupi:

The 'uniqueness' of the publication is stated as:

//This edition of Mahabharata published by Shri Matha is based on the
literary works of Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya by Shri Madhvacharya and
Mahabharata Lakshalankara by Shri Vadiraja Teertha. Therefore, instances
not validated by Lord Vedavyasa will not be found in this edition making it
one of its specialities.//

According to the above, there are editions that have instances that are not
to the liking and approval of Madhva and Vadiraja Teertha. And naturally,
they are deemed not validated by Veda Vyasa. The implicit conclusion is
that such instances found in various editions  are interpolations.  The
labeling of this edition as 'vaishnava pATha' is strange indeed, and its
implication is anybody's guess.

Unless the volumes are examined one can't be sure as to in what way this
edition is different from the Kumbhakonam edition edited and brought out by
T.R.Krishnacharya and T.R.Vyasacharya, Madhva Vilas Book Depot, Kumbhakonam
in 1909  and the one that was recently brought out/updated by a review
committee in which Dr.D.Prahladachar and Sri Srinivasa Varkhedi were
members along with others.
