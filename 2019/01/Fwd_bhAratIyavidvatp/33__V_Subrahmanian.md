Namaste,

There is another book which deals with Pre-Sankara Advaita in detail, in 13
chapters and more than 400 pages - Sri Sankarat Prag Advaita Vada by
Muralidhara Pandey.

Just to follow up on this.

I have managed to locate the paper "Pre Sankara Advaita" by S L Pandey. It
is included as one of the chapters in the book titled 'History of Science,
Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization - Volume II Part 2 - Advaita
Vedanta' edited by R Balasubramanian, a work which I have recently
purchased.
