Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Invitation to join S'aastra-wise networks
instituted by Indic Academy's Inter University Centre for Indic Knowledge
Systems.
To: भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Indic Academy's Inter University Centre for Indic Knowledge Systems as part
of its objective of connecting Indic scholars and Indic institutes, has
launched a new initiative of

S'aastra-wise networks

which is intended to provide platforms for scholars of various s'aastras
such as Meemaamsaa, Nyaaya, VyaakaraNa, Vedaanta etc. to meet other
scholars in the s'aastra of their pursuit /expertise for exchange of ideas,
discussions, debates, for learning from each other, for inspiration and
emulation, for collaborations, for collective generation of knowledge,for
collective facing of detractors of either individual scholars or the
s'aastra or the s'aastric tradition etc.

The network connects traditional scholars of each of these s'aastras among
themselves and with the university and research institute scholars
specialising in that s'aastra and with scholars of Vaidika gurukulas run by
governmental and non-governmental organisations, traditional Vaidika
gurukulas of grihagurukula and other types, and scholars pursuing or
commanding the s'aastras while being in various careers such as school
teacher, college teacher, various government, corporate or other private
jobs of various kinds or just some traditional occupation such as a farmer,
in short any scholar pursuing or commanding the s'aastra in India or
abroad.

The launching of the first of such networks was done in the form of
Meemaamsaa s'aastra network at the recent Mimamsa Vakyartha Sadas organised
by Chinmaya Viswa Vidyapeeth with funds from Indic Academy at Chinmaya
University, Veliyanad/Cochin. Sri Mani Draavida Shastrigal and Sri
Chirravuri SriRama S'arma garu were the senior scholars who signed up on
that day. A few young masters of the s'aastra too signed up on that
occasion. Another senior scholar Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam too signed up
for it recently.

I request other Meemaamsaa scholars/students/Vidyaarthis to join the
network by expressing their consent here in this list  or through an
individual mail to me.

I request scholars/students/Vidyaarthis of Nyaaya, VyaakaraNa, Vedaanta etc
also to join the networks of the respective s'aastras by expressing their
consent here in this list  or through an individual mail to me.

Members may suggest new networks too than the one mentioned here.
