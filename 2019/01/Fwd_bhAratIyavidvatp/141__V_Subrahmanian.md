Namaste,

Dr.Rangan ji, son of Sri Anna (Krishnapremi Swamiji) is running a veda &
shastra gurukulam in Bangalore.  Just have a glimpse of it ! Really
amazing..

vaTus are taught vedas as per their swa-shakha. Simultaneously, kAvyAs like
rAmAyaNa are taught both to boys & girls.  During past time (anadhyayana
days),
laukika vidyas are imparted and trained in various scientific &
mental-ability project works along with leelavathi bija ganitam.

The medium of instruction is strictly in sanskrit and even students
converse among themselves in sanskrit.  They also play Football, Kabaddi
etc. and converse with ease
in sanskrit while playing !

Here is youtube link :

A unique gurukulam !
