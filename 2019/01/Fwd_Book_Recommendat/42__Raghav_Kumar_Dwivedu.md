To add to what you wrote....

Swami Shuddhabodhanadaji of Arsha Vidya tradition gives a more nuanced
teaching giving vedAntic samadhi abhyAsa its place of importance . His book
on dRg-dRShya-viveka is memorably titled 'Vedantic ways to samAdhi'.

Generally, people who over criticize samadhi-abhyAsa may be doing so
because they themselves do not have the necessary vixepa-rAhityam.

When Sri VidyaraNya who was an adept in vedAntic samAdhi (inferred from his
writing a work like jIvanmuktiviveka) mocks samAdhi as being easily
disturbed even by the sound of a mosquito, it rings true because he was
already accomplished in vedAntic samAdhi.

Sri Candrashekhara BhAratI mahasvaminaH has written a commentary on
vivekacUDAmaNi. What more needs to be said to attest to it's authenticity!

Om
