Namaste.

The relevant verse (quoted by Sri Raghav Ji)  is BUBV 1-4-402.

<< यया यया भवेत्पुंसा॔ व्युत्पत्तिः प्रत्यगात्मनि॥

सा सैव प्रक्रियेह स्यात्साध्वी सा चानवस्थिता । >>

<< yayA yayA bhavetpuMsA॔ vyutpattiH pratyagAtmani||

sA saiva prakriyeha syAtsAdhvI sA chAnavasthitA | >>.



The context is Srishti prakriyas, various versions concerning  methodology
of Creation. What the verse states is that the various versions mentioned
in the Shrutis are meant to cater to different adhikArIs. Commentary of
Acharya Anandagiri clarifies this.

<< एवम् सृश्टिविप्रतिपत्तौ कीदृशी सृश्टिरेश्टव्येत्याशङ्क्याऽऽह I *ययेति* ।
इहेति श्रौतमार्गोक्तिः । साध्वीति फलवत्वकथनम् । व्यवस्थिता तर्हि
सेत्याशङ्क्याधिकारिबुद्दितारतम्यान्नैवमित्याह । *सा* *चेति*  । >>

<< evam sRRishTivipratipattau kIdRRishI sRRishTireshTavyetyAsha~NkyA.a.aha
I *yayeti* | iheti shrautamArgoktiH | sAdhvIti phalavatvakathanam |
vyavasthitA tarhi setyAsha~NkyAdhikAribudditAratamyAnnaivamityAha | *sA
cheti*  | >>



Of course it is another matter that this verse is extended, many times
indiscriminately in my view, to unintended contexts, as is well known.
