“By whatever method the knowledge of the indwelling self can be attained by men, that method is valid; and such methods are innumerable”.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

I don’t know the context in which it has been said by vArtikakAra.  But don’t our traditionalists think that shAstra is the ONLY pramANA and there is no other way to realize it??  'nAnyaH paNtha ayanAya vidyate' says Shruti as well.  If there are 'innumerable' methods to achieve the same goal then in our tradition shAstra-s untya prAmANya very badly suffers I reckon.  And bhAshyakAra is quite clear the role of shAstra / scripture when it comes to final realization.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

Dear All,

In his text "Points of difference between BhAmati and VivaraNam", S.N.Sastri quotes the following sentence of Sureshvaracharya:
“By whatever method the knowledge of the indwelling self can be attained by men, that method is valid; and such methods are innumerable”.

Can anyone tell me the exact work from where that quotation from Sureshvaracharya is taken?

Thanking you,
Prof. Dilip Loundo
Brazil
