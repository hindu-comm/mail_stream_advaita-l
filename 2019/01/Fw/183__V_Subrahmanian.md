Of course, we do not admit the prakriya-s that have been refuted by the
ShAnkara Vedanta. Since the shruti and bhashya cannot be exhaustive,
prakriya-s that are designed by Acharya-s to suit the specific needs of
aspirants are also acceptable. We cannot deny the efficacy of a prakriya
just because it is not found in the bhashya. That is what I meant. saa cha
anavasthitaa itself means that ' it is impossible for the shruti and
bhashya to list the infinite prakriyas and therefore what is stated is only
an upalakshana'
