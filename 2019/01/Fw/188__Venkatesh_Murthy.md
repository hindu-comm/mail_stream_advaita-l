Namaste

>Why there is fight among vyAkhyAnakAra-s (bhAmati and vivaraNa) when
prakriya bedha hardly matters since the result is same??

The fight was there. But not there nowadays. The fight was there because
they thought Bhamati is very closely following Mandana Mishra. Mandana
Mishra's prakriya is not agreeing with basic principles of Sankara Advaita.
That is why there was a fight. But now we know Bhamati is different and
Mandana is different prakriya and Bhamati followers like Appayya Diksita
gave a lot of clarifications. No fight now.
