Dear All,

In his text "Points of difference between BhAmati and VivaraNam", S.N.Sastri
quotes the following sentence of Sureshvaracharya:
“By whatever method the knowledge of the indwelling self can be
attained by men, that method is valid; and such methods are
innumerable”.

Can anyone tell me the exact work from where that quotation from Sureshvaracharya is taken?

Thanking you,
Prof. Dilip Loundo
