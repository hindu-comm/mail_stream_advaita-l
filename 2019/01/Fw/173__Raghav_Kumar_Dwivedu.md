Namaste

This is the well-known verse.

yayA yayA bhavetpuMso vyutpattih pratyagAtmani
sA sAiva prakriyA jneyA sAdhvI sA chAnavasthitA |

This is from brihadAraNyaka bhAShya vArttikam by Sri Sureshvaracharya


By whatever prakriyA (teaching method), the student obtains knowledge
of the Innermost (Non-dual) Self,

 that method is to be regarded as sound

Such valid means of conveying Advaitic knowledge are innumerable.
