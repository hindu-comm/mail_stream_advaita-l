By whatever prakriyA (teaching method), the student obtains knowledge of the Innermost (Non-dual) Self,  that method is to be regarded as sound Such valid means of conveying Advaitic knowledge are innumerable.

Further clarification required with regard to prakriya-s (teaching method) here in the context of his statement.  Whether being a hard core saMpradAyavAdi Sri Sureshwara talking about prakriya-s enshrined within the ambit of shAstra like kArya-kAraNa, avasthAtraya, paNchakOsha, srushti, sAmAnya-vishesha etc.?? In all probability Yes, I think.    These prakriya-s which can strictly be restricted and understood within the sphere of shAstra and the knowledge can be obtained either through one or more of these prakriya-s since all these prakriya-s have the base in Shruti / shAstra.  Is this he is clarifying or something else ??  pls. elaborate the context in the vArtika.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
