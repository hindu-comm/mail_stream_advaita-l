I wrote on the FB page:

I saw a video about the Gurukulama and am impressed by the activities
there. I would recommend Gruhasthas living in India and abroad wanting to
perpetuate our Dharma and the Dharmic way of life to put their boys in this
Gurukulam. We should never have the doubt concerning the future of our boys
if they are admitted to the Gurukulam. Let's remember that the boys coming
out of a full course of study at the Gurukulam will in no way be inferior
to doctors, engineers and accountants and other professionals.
