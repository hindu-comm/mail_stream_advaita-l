Namaste to Respected Members
Sri Gurubyo Namaha!

I would like to take valued opinion of members regarding the subject matter.

My perception so far is that:

ArthApatti PramANa is being effectively used during AdhyAropa - ApavAda
deduction for Advaita Vedanta
and
Anupalabdhi be being effectively applied for Anvaya - Vyatirekam like in
Pancadasi.

Much value your opinion please.

Harih Om

Babu
