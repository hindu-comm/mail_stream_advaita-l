Soundaryalahari is the crest jewel among stotras blessed by Sri Adi
Shankaracharya. Each of the 100 slokas is a gem by itself. Now
Ganakalabhushana vid. R .K. Padmanabha has set these gems in gold by
rendering all the slokas in 100 ragas in pure classical Kriti format. This
is a pioneering attempt. He has chosen a number  of rare ragas here.

Hence it's a monumental contribution to both music and spiritual field

Though slokas have been presented in various forms , singing in Kriti
format allowes unlimited  scope to emote every phrase ,every word . This is
surely highly beneficial to musician as well as the audience

Vid. RKP has set a trend now. .


The book is beautifully brought out with sloka,meaning of each word and
meaning of the sloka on left page. Notation on the right page. All in
Kannada script


Set of CDs along with the book costs Rs.500/.

Book and CD were released by Shatavadhani R. Ganesh at NR colony Rama
Mandira on 8 th sept 2019.
