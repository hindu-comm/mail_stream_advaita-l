Dear Members,
                           For any Hindu Performing Shraadh Karma should be a highest form of ritual apara karma which we want to do with so much authenticity with Shraddha, Bhakti so that the results of the karma (Food & water) should reach the ancestors through kak-bhusundi family members which we strongly believe.

How ever I have seen  many nusance people who does have a word to their parents during their vanaprastha times , however do perform the taddinam (shraadha karma) for the advertizement sake for show up that they takes care of their ancestors which is unethical in my view and for this they have to pay a big price and get ready to bear that fruits of show up karma.

Ok, Leaving  this negative aspect of this behind, Today's Times has interesting article related to this by Swami Tejomayananda.


Swamiji describes the reaching of the food/water (tarpana/sapinda shraadha as per vidhi vidhaan) depends on various factors. To achieve this one should have blind faith in veda's which are apoursheyas. if some one firmly believes the veda's then one must follow its injections without tarka/mimansas before performing the rituals. 

All jivas are borned along with own karma, none can remove it, every one has to face off it, if you like it or not.  Jivas are not in isolation  & one has to live with the other members of the society.

If we can recollect the Confrontation of Sureshwaracharya (Madana Misra) with adi shankara, Misraji shoots a question to adi shankara that :

The pinda whihc is growing in the mother's woomb & the Shraadha pinds are the same? If same why inside & outside, If difffer how they differ.. Adi Shnakra answers this in a very systematic way with his siddhanta to Misraji so that misraji himself convinces with shankara's Logical analysis. 

Gaya is the the (vihnu pada gaya) best place to perform the Pitru Shraadha and Siddhapur (matru gaya) in the Maheshana District near ahmedabad (where i have been earlier) to perform the matru shraadha.

How ever, one can perform the shraadha on the banks of ganges, teertha stthala, puri, badari (brahmma kapala kunda), varansi & allahabad sangam, Banks of Godavari, krishna, yamuna, tungabhadra, kaveri & all rivers nearer to respective pleace. 

Newton Mahaseya says that every action produces a result.  Hence the result of that particular karma will help the jiva. People belong to other cultures/religions may not perform these rituals, but they do intheir own way by rembering their loved ones, Thanks giving, Gift sharing on their death anniversaries is also sharing of karma,perform the rituals in thier own traditions which definitely yields the reults in my VIEW.

MAHALAYA SHRAADHAM IS ON 28/9/19 (Satruday- Amavasya)

  Dear Members,
 Being a Religious Science Scholar since my childhood, I used to read the several advaita scientific articles from different authors and listen to several discourse from the learned. I learnt many things from those and gained knowledge out of it. Similar in to this todays TIMES has an article to overcome excessive individualism . or Too much Independance by Author Rajiv Vij and how to overcome that.

The whole world (family/society/nation) is more in Independence rather than the individual. Any organization or Individual is not fully independent and more over it is interdependence life style which leads to progress. No Organization is successful without depending on the people who working towards its growth and In a similar way no individual is successful with out help from others and he is not fully independent.

Simple fact that one has to understand at a basic level is that : The opportunity (e.g physical body) is mere a gift or arise from somebody's joy/pleasure and it is their grace that the out overs what ever we are wearing today. Before we entered into this physical world, it is their help or grace to used their land to use of excretions form the body. Since they allowed us to use their land to survive in the beginning otherwise where we stand now??. I mean we are dependent for each of our activity since beginning on somebody and then where is the question of Individuality or freedom??

In reality there is no freedom exists for an individual, Can't we accept this fact and reorient our selves towards realization. The First Urine we take s & puts in the mother womb in the field of excretions and Amniotic fluids. So it is the Mothers Grace that she has allowed you to use her system for the survival in the beginning and we for get this when we grow as our ego dominates as we are so &so & so &so.

We claim that as a Nation we are independent and in reality we are half-independent only and we are depending on others for most of the things. Excessive individualism has infected our culture as a virus and political corporate scandals are restricting our freedom of progress with a profit making approach.

A competitive mind set with self centredness is giving birht to new nationalistic policies. Do you think that we are going in the right direction and are we secured for the future?? and we dont have answers for this questions due to our excessive individualism.

 Dear Members,             Although I write earlier regarding this , but the pitrupaksha time makes me to take life lessons from the story of enlightened crow called Kak-Bhusundi. Today TIMES by author Sh. Mukul Shri Goel has a lot of interesting to say to us in simple terms.
Lessons from the Life of Kak-Bhushundi:
Here is the Link: If any one has few minutes of time in this pitru pakhsa period , pls spend some time on this link and try to get some information / Lessons from it which applicable to me also.
The story of an enlightened crow

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/the-story-of-an-enlightened-crow/

Every scenario of a tragedy or suffering where God's grace may reduce the amount of Karmic cleansing required, One may still have to face of some suffering. The best examples for this is several Gods man's life's, I have seen many & whom I know well which I can't put it here .
Moral of the Story : Kak - Bhusundi has seen the 14 pralaya kal times and seen people how they take births, suffers & gets dissolved finally without reaching the enlightenment to take the birth again to suffer. He has removed the ego of the vehicle of Vishnu i.e Garud and removes his ahankar being the largest bird & his closeness to god vishnu.
Being close to the God vishnu, Garud has always has a pride which make the main obstacle for the enlightenment and which gets removed after he confronts with Kak - Bhushundi which can depicted nicely in Sri Ramacharita manas also.

 Dear Members,            Mahalaya Paksha or PITRUPaksha has already started on September 14th for this immediatelyafter Ananta Chaturdasi/ Vamana Jayanthi. Many people performs Shraddha Karma’sduring that period on their respective tidhis or on the final day i.e MahalayAmavasya. Since It is coming in the month of Bhadrapada Maas, ancesstors getssatisfied much if some one performs Tarpana/ Shraddha Karma’s during thisperiod.
If father is alive andlost their mother, they can perform the Tarpana/ Shraddha on Navami if not ontheir respective tidhi’s. If both the parents were lost, then one must do theirworshipping during this period of 15 days , If not all the days, one shouldperform the rites on the final day i. e AMAVASYA (28/9/19).



STORY:

The Greatest Donor of theEarth, The suta putra, Warrior of the Maha Bharatha war , Karna went to Swargamafter his death in the battle field. Before he was teaching the heaven, he felthungry & thirsty and in between he finds a tree so that he can tear a fruitfrom the tree, but surprisingly, it turned into a GOLD ball. He took littlewater from the near by pond into his hand, it also turned into Gold.

The same story repeatedfor him after he entered into heaven.

He felt so guilty why itis happening like this and thought that what was his mistake in the mind.Suddenly, Akasavani or Asarira vani spoke like this:

KARNA: You are ever thegreatest donor of the earth and there is no doubt for this and no one also succeedyou in the donation. You have given everything you possess in your life withoutkeeping the hand bone. You have donated Gold, silver, money coins, but you didnot offer FOOD (RICE/WATER) To any one so that their BHUK was removed. That isthe reason for you that you are facing the current trouble. So immediately heworshipped his father sun god andrequested indra for a solution. Indra advised Karna to go to Bhu Lok andperform the Tarpana/offered food to the needy and did anna santarpana to all on the very first day of Padyamiand retuned back to heaven on Amavasya

After the offering of Food to relatives, elders & needy, hishungry was immediately removed and it took 15 days to reach the heaven, henceit is called Pitru Paksha and final day is called mahalaya Amavasya i.e Day of offering of Food toAncestors.
Learned are requested to contribute on this thread of any reference/examples/ procedures of Rites.
