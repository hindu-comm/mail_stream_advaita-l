Dear Members,            Mahalaya Paksha or PITRUPaksha has already started on September 14th for this immediatelyafter Ananta Chaturdasi/ Vamana Jayanthi. Many people performs Shraddha Karma’sduring that period on their respective tidhis or on the final day i.e MahalayAmavasya. Since It is coming in the month of Bhadrapada Maas, ancesstors getssatisfied much if some one performs Tarpana/ Shraddha Karma’s during thisperiod.
If father is alive andlost their mother, they can perform the Tarpana/ Shraddha on Navami if not ontheir respective tidhi’s. If both the parents were lost, then one must do theirworshipping during this period of 15 days , If not all the days, one shouldperform the rites on the final day i. e AMAVASYA (28/9/19).



STORY:

The Greatest Donor of theEarth, The suta putra, Warrior of the Maha Bharatha war , Karna went to Swargamafter his death in the battle field. Before he was teaching the heaven, he felthungry & thirsty and in between he finds a tree so that he can tear a fruitfrom the tree, but surprisingly, it turned into a GOLD ball. He took littlewater from the near by pond into his hand, it also turned into Gold.

The same story repeatedfor him after he entered into heaven.

He felt so guilty why itis happening like this and thought that what was his mistake in the mind.Suddenly, Akasavani or Asarira vani spoke like this:

KARNA: You are ever thegreatest donor of the earth and there is no doubt for this and no one also succeedyou in the donation. You have given everything you possess in your life withoutkeeping the hand bone. You have donated Gold, silver, money coins, but you didnot offer FOOD (RICE/WATER) To any one so that their BHUK was removed. That isthe reason for you that you are facing the current trouble. So immediately heworshipped his father sun god andrequested indra for a solution. Indra advised Karna to go to Bhu Lok andperform the Tarpana/offered food to the needy and did anna santarpana to all on the very first day of Padyamiand retuned back to heaven on Amavasya

After the offering of Food to relatives, elders & needy, hishungry was immediately removed and it took 15 days to reach the heaven, henceit is called Pitru Paksha and final day is called mahalaya Amavasya i.e Day of offering of Food toAncestors.
Learned are requested to contribute on this thread of any reference/examples/ procedures of Rites.

Dear Members,             Although I write earlier regarding this , but the pitrupaksha time makes me to take life lessons from the story of enlightened crow called Kak-Bhusundi. Today TIMES by author Sh. Mukul Shri Goel has a lot of interesting to say to us in simple terms.
Lessons from the Life of Kak-Bhushundi:
Here is the Link: If any one has few minutes of time in this pitru pakhsa period , pls spend some time on this link and try to get some information / Lessons from it which applicable to me also.
The story of an enlightened crow

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/the-story-of-an-enlightened-crow/

Every scenario of a tragedy or suffering where God's grace may reduce the amount of Karmic cleansing required, One may still have to face of some suffering. The best examples for this is several Gods man's life's, I have seen many & whom I know well which I can't put it here .
Moral of the Story : Kak - Bhusundi has seen the 14 pralaya kal times and seen people how they take births, suffers & gets dissolved finally without reaching the enlightenment to take the birth again to suffer. He has removed the ego of the vehicle of Vishnu i.e Garud and removes his ahankar being the largest bird & his closeness to god vishnu.
Being close to the God vishnu, Garud has always has a pride which make the main obstacle for the enlightenment and which gets removed after he confronts with Kak - Bhushundi which can depicted nicely in Sri Ramacharita manas also.
