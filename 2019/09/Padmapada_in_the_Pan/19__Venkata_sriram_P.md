 Another shloka to reveal that Sankara was
walking Shiva in disguise 

जगतीमवितुं कलिताकृतयो 
विचरन्ति महामहसश्छलतः ।

 Namaste,

There is no doubt about this and that too for we advaitins.

From तोटकाष्टकम्

…………….
भव एव भवानिति मे नितरां
समजायत चेतसि कौतुकिता ।
……………………

गुरुपुङ्गव पुङ्गवकेतन ते 
समतामयतां नहि कोऽपि सुधीः ।

This should not be a surprise for us....however, the crux lies in realising that 
we are also Shiva !
