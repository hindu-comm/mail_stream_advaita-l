In a recent conversation with eminent scholar Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal I
asked him if he had written any shloka-s, stotras or any metrical
document.  To that he replied hesitantly that a work of 101 verses in
simple meter was written by him and published in a souvenir to felicitate a
renowned scholar Vidwan Sri Umakantha Bhatta recently. Upon my requesting
him to share the work he kindly did so. It is a work important for Advaita
Vedanta where the 'bhrama' tattva has been delineated by him. It is titled
'khyaati-tattva-samiikshanam' (A review of the concept of bhrama).  It
examines the various views of 'bhrama' and upholds the
'anirvachaniyakhyati' that is accepted by Advaitins.  The work can be
viewed/downloaded here:
