'Some Modern views on Shankara'  an old article

Here is an article that appeared in the Journal of the Annamalai University
in 1933. It is of interest to followers of Shankara. The author's views are
there for one to accept or otherwise.

The article was shared with me just a few days ago.

One observation of the author interested me and that is: the distinction
between Ramanuja and Shankara on the idea of 'Vasudeva.'
