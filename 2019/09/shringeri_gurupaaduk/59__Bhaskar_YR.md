Hare Krishna

During the gurupAduka pooja, the priest who performs this pooja will do the mantra pushpa, ashtAvadhAna seva and rAshtrAsheeervaada as well with specific mantra and birudAvaLi??  If yes, kindly give me more details.

Recently I heard there is specific ashtAvadhAna seva for the rAmachandra pura mathAdheesha Sri rAghaveshwara bhArati swamy.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
