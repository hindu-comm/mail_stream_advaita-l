Dear all,

I am happy to announce the publication of my new book 'Samanya Dharma –
Ethical Duties Common To All'. The book has been published by Subbu
Publication, Bengaluru.

It gives an overview of ethical principles as enunciated in Hindu textual
tradition. The ethical duties taught in the Sruti, Smriti, Itihasa, and
Puranas have all been covered in considerable depth along with nuanced
enunciation regarding how they must be practiced on the ground. More
importantly, the book discusses how and why Samanya Dharma is relevant to
us Here & Now today.

Interested can order the copies from Hindu Eshop-
