Thanks Chandramouli ji, for that very germane quote with avidyA, kAraNam, prakRti, bIjam etc., in samanadhikaraNyam.

Also glad to know that Sri SSS also concedes as much...

praNAms Sri Raghava prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Sri SSS is quite explicit in differentiating the mAyA and avidyA.  The IshAvAsya's foot note is not completely quoted  as Sri SSS very clearly says since mAya is avidyA kalpita it is called avidyA here and he also mentions in this very foot note that nowhere else this equation can be found in prasthAna traya bhAshya.  And he further gives the various bhAshya references wherein bhAshyakAra equates mAya with avyakta, prakruti, shakti etc.  So, you can be rest assured atleast according to Sri SSS avidyA is NOT mAya even in this quote as he clearly clarifies since mAyA is avidyA kalpita it is called avidyA here.  And as you know bhAshyakAra uses these two terms differently in the same sentences at various places of bhAshya.  In Geeta bhAshya, avidyA is compared to 'visha' and mAya is compared to 'anna'.  Visha saMyukta anna can also be called sometimes for brevity as "visha" , it does not mean 'anna' is itself visha.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
