The actual vakyam there in the BGB 7.4 is:  अहङ्कारः इति
अविद्यासंयुक्तमव्यक्तम् । यथा विषसंयुक्तमन्नं विषमित्युच्यते,
एवमहङ्कारवासनावत् अव्यक्तं मूलकारणमहङ्कार इत्युच्यते, प्रवर्तकत्वात्
अहङ्कारस्य । अहङ्कार एव हि सर्वस्य प्रवृत्तिबीजं दृष्टं लोके । इतीयं यथोक्ता
 प्रकृतिः मे मम ऐश्वरी मायाशक्तिः अष्टधा भिन्ना भेदमागता ॥ ४ ॥

Here Shankara says at the end that the eight-fold differentiation as
ahankara, etc. is a product of Mayashakti. That way all the products of
Maya are non-different from Maya. Ahankara is stated by Shankara as
avidya-samyukta on the analogy of visha-samyukta anna is called visha.
avyakta is equated to mulakaranam. That mulakaranam is given another name
in this vakya as maayaa shakti.  On a search I found that this is the only
place Shankara has used the word 'mulakaranam' to refer to Mayashakti. The
rest of the 5 uses in the prasthana traya bhashya is to refer to Brahman.
