Is  this  avidyA  same  as  the ones  mentioned  in the  long  list  of  synonyms  for  ignorance.Clarification  is  requested.

>  For that matter synonyms provided for avidya by vyAkhyAna  grantha are quite dubious and debatable.  I donâ€™t know how can terms like  prakruti, AkAsha, mAyA, avyAkrutaM, avyaktaM etc. be paryAya for avidyA.  If we say AkAsha is avidyA then we have to say there is a birth to avidyA from Atman, AtmanaH AkAsh saMbhUtaH, AkAshAt vAyuH etc. and prakruti, lord says he has two types of prakruti one is para and another is apara so, bhagavAn has two types of avidyA then.  That too he acknowledges it as 'mama prakruti', 'mama mAya'  ðŸ˜Š and through this prakruti dvaya he says he is the sarvajna, Ishwara etc.  prakrutidvayadvareNa ahaM sarvajnaH, IshwarO jagataH kAraNaM ityarthaH, says Geeta bhAshyakAra.  And that  mayAntu prakrutiM vidyAm mAyinantu maheshwaraM, mAyin maheshwara is avidyAvaNta as per mAyA=prakruti=avidyA ðŸ˜Š So, vyAkhyAna-s should always be given second tier status when mUla bhAshya / shruti / smruti  says entirely different thing. 

>  And it is always better to leave all these things AS IT IS  to flow in tradition to protect the 'traditional teaching'.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
