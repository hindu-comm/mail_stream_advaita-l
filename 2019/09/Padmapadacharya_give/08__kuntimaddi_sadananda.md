 Bhaskar ji, In that sutra bhashya Shankara cites the Br.Up. to say that
avidya/avyakta is 'called' aakaasha.

In fact Brahman is also called by the name aakaasha. But this is not the
popular akasha, space/ether that you thought of and said 'atmanah aakaashah
sambhuutah.'

---------------------------
PraNAms - Yes in Bri. Up. Bhashya - Shankara defines Akaasha as Brahman in the sense of prakaash, the self-illuminating entity.
