THE CHANDI NAVAKSHARI MANTRA AND ITS INTERPRETATION

TheNine-lettered Mantra (AIM HRIM KLIM CHAAMUNDAI VICCHE)  isthe sound body of Chandika Parameshwari composed of 9 Durgas (Nava DurgaRupini). The Devi Atharvasirsa Upanishad proclaims this mantra and extols thisas giver of highest delight (“Mahad Ananda dayakah”). The great shaktaBhaskararaya Makhi says that this mantra gives final liberation “Brahma SayujyaPradaTa”. 

AIM: Bija of Mahakali,HRIM : Bija of Mahalakshmi,KLIM : Bija of Mahasaraswathi

Though the Kali bija is KLIM, here it is givenas AIM. Though the Lakshmi bija is SRIM, here it is given as HRIM; Though theSaraswathi bija is AIM, it is given here as KLIM. So, as per the 3 Charitas /Cycles in Sapthasathi, it should have been KLIM, SRIM, AIM. But it is not so. 

Because these Bijas are of Kali, Lakshmi and Saraswathi. Whereas, the deitiesof 3 Charitas are Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Maharaswathi that are entirelydifferent aspects as I mentioned above in introducing murthi rahasya. 

Mahakali is Prakasa Swarupa which isan aspect of Sattva Guna. Therefore, AIM bija stands for Prakasa (Illumination). This is “Chit” aspect of Brahman. 

Mahalakshmi is Kriya Swarupa whichis an aspect of Rajo Guna. Therefore, HRIM bija stands for Kriya. This is “Sat”aspect of Brahman.

Mahasaraswathi is Sthiti / Nirodha / Ananda Rupa that holds back bothPrakasa and Kriya which is an aspect of Tamo Guna. Therefore, KLIM bija standsfor Nirodha. This is “Ananda” aspect of Brahman.
