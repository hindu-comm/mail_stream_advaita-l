There is a very useful resource worked out of the Mahabharata corpus that
groups verses under a number of topics:

https://sa.wikiquote.org/s/14n

One can navigate from this page to the various main and sub groups and the
interesting topics.

When was this work compiled and by whom?

We bow to those great men who have spent tremendous time and effort for
this project.

warm regards
