In continuation of the above post, we have now the Dipika, a gloss, on the
Kalagni Rudropanishat by Narayana who has written dipika-s for some 40 plus
Upanishads.  The Dipika on this Kalagnirudra is available here for viewing:

In the collection of '11 Atharvana Upanishads', we have the 'Vasudeva
Upanishad' and 'Gopichandana Upanishad'.  For both these Narayana's
Dipika-s are available.  Thus, we see the Vedanta Acharya of the 13th
Century commenting on Upanishads that speak about both Bhasma Dharana
Tripundra and the Gopichandana Urdhvapundra.  Surely, a sectarian will not
do this.
