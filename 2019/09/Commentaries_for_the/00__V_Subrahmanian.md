In the Bhashya for the 4th sutra ‘tat tu samanvayaat’, at the end, Shankara
has cited three verses that are very crucial to the tenets of Advaita.
These verses are said to be of a ‘Sundara Pandya’ who is also said to have
written on purva mimamsa. In order to help the study of these verses, the
commentaries of Panchapadika, Bhamati, Nyayanirnaya and Ratnaprabha are
selected and given in this file. The English translation by Swami
Gambhirananda of the verses and the Kannada translation by Swami
Sachidanandendra Saraswati have also been provided in this file which can
be viewed here:
