Dear Members,
Interpretation of Navakshari
CHAAMUNDA is the Cosmic Power of Brahman which is Para Shakti. “Chamati –atthi, sarvam charaacharam iti Chamuh” ie., All the principles of creation atthe time of dissolution is Chamuh. “daati (laati)” is the act of devouring orswallowing. So, Chaamunda is the Supreme Cosmic Power that devours the entirecreation at the time of dissolution. 
VICCHE denotes the act of Salutation.
“Salutations to the all devouring cosmicpower Chaamunda that is the samasti rupa (integrated form) of Mahakali,Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswathi”
“Vit Chinoti iti Vicche” ie., bestowerof supreme knowledge (Vit). This would become:
“Prostrations to Mahakali, Mahalakshmi,Mahasaraswathi Swarupa Chamunda – the bestower of Supreme Knowledge (BrahmaJnana)”
CHAAMUNDA stands of Brahma Vidya.
VICCHE is VIT+CHA+E. VIT stands for Chit aspect of Brahman; CHA stands for Sataspect of Brahman and E stands for Ananda aspect of Brahman. So, this wouldbecome:
“May we meditate on Chit rupa Mahakali; Sat rupa Mahalakshmi; Ananda rupaMahasaraswathi in our heart for Brahma Vidya”.
AIM, HRIM, KLIM = Brahma (BrahmaVachaka or Supreme Consciousness) ;
CHA = Jiva is (Jiva vachaka –Individual Consciousness)AMUNDA = Non-different (Abhedaswarupa)
AI = Thus, we know to be VICCHE = Advaita Jnanaprade; ChitSat Ananda Rupini
This means:
“May we know the Chit Sat Ananda rupaBrahma who is Chandi to be non-different from Jiva”
The “Tat Tvam Asi” mahaavaakya is indicated here. The Navakshari when chantedwith this bhavana grants the sadhaka the final union with Brahman – theKnowledge, Existence and Bliss Absolute. 
Interpretation of Chandi Navakshari by Sri T.V.Kapali Sastry – a disciple ofSri Aurobindo and Ganapati Muni
If all the vowels and consonants in the Mantra are counted, it will be 24 andso, some scholars claim that Navakshari is the Gayatri of Chandi. There is7-fold division in the mantra. It is : 1) AIM 2) HRIM 3) KLIM 4) CHAMUNDAYAI 5)VIT 6) CA 7) E. 

There are 7 psychological principles that represent 7 planes of consciousnessin the Individual. They are 1) Anna 2) Prana 3) Manas 4) Vigyana 5) Ananda 6)Chit 7) Sat. Here, Chit, Sat, Ananda represent the Higher Triple State andAnna, Prana, Manas represent the Lower Triple State of Individual. 

Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati represent the higher triple state ofGod-head with its Chit, Sat, Ananda Swarupa gets involved in creation of lowertriple worlds ie., physical, vital and mental (Anna, Praana, Manas) throughVigyana (Gnosis). This Gnosis or Vigyana is represented by CHAAMUNDA. The lowertriple in turn has to evolve into the higher triple through Chaamunda. Thus, inthe Mantra, AIM HRIM KLIM and Vicce represent the Higher Triple and LowerTriple Worlds respectively while the CHAMUNDAYAI denotes the world of Vigyana,Gnosis, the plane of Light (Mahas). The mantra is an invocation to the SupremeGoddess in the form of Truth-Consciousness -Bliss, made by the beingcircumscribed by the lower triple of physical, vital and mental states. Theprayer is made so that the being is freed by the grace of Chaamunda from hispresent triple state of distortion to reach the true state ofTruth-Consciousness -Bliss.
