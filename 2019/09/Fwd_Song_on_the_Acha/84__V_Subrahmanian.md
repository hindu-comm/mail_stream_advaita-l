Here is a rendering of a song composed by a Kannada poet devotee on HH
Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Swamiji's departing decades ago. This
song is well known to many devotees of the Sringeri Peetham and is also
being sung in several households and bhajan groups. The composer brings out
several aspects of sanatana dharma too along with his moving tribute to the
Acharya.
