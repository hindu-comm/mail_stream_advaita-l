Namaste,

यो दक्षिणास्यो निजमौनभावं प्रकाश्य शान्त्यै मुनिसत्तमानाम् ।
आह स्तवेस्मिन्नखिलात्मतां च स शङ्करो भाति मदन्तरङ्गे ॥

Meaning:

“That Dakshinamurti (the Shiva facing South) who manifested His state of Silence for 
bestowing peace to the foremost among the ascetics; that which is the Self of All as 
stated by Sankara Bhagavatpada in this hymn (Dakshinamurti Stotra); shines in my Heart”

The above couplet was composed by Bhagavan Ramana Maharishi on Dakshinamurti 
while glancing at Sankara Bhagavatpada’s Dakshinamurti Stotra.

Thus, a Dakshinamurti acknowledges another Dakshinamurti and declares His identity 
with the foremost among the Gurus who taught only in Silence.

sriram
