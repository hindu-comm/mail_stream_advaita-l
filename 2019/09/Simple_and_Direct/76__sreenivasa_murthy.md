Dear friends, If a mumukshu studies the following mantras 
in the order as mentioned below
he will realize that the statements as stated below 
are facts of life which he was not aaware earler. 
Then the desire to refer to any other reading material 
will automatically drop off. 
Mantras to be studied : Katha Upanishad 2-1-3
 Then 
 Kena Upanishad 2-4 Then 
 Katha Upanishad 2-1-4 
First mantra removes the identification with the senses.The second mantra removes identification with antaHkaraNa.The third mantra removes the fundamental misconception 
that one is a name and form.The destination is reached and the journey is over.
The mumukshu will be a kRutArtha. 

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
