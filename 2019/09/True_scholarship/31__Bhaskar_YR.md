The whole problem arises because of pramANatva of shabda. If the modern scholars do not accept shabda-pramANa, they cannot explain Upanishad and Brahma Sutra. If they accept shabda-pramANa, they have to per force become absolute orthodox. So, their approach towards karma-kANDa is quite self contractory.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
