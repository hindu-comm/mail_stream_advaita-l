Namaste
I request you to share any prAmANika information on how a sannyAsi is
welcomed, honoured and worshipped in our tradition.

Where is the vidhAna in granthas for 'pUrNa kumbha' svAgatam with mantras
such as 'na karmaNA' etc., by grihasthas?

Sringeri and Kanchi Acharyas are often worshipped with arghya-pAdyAdi when
invited home   - if anyone has all of the actual mantras used by the
inviting grihasthas to firstly welcome and then worship yatis as per
Sringeri or Kanchi tradition, I request you to share the details.

In any other smritis or granthas etc., is there any phala Shruti for
yati-pUjanam done by the grihasthas - both from the point of view of
abhyudaya and nihshreyasa phalas ?

The above prAmANika information was asked by Swami Haribrahmendrananda ji
of Uttarkashi for a specific upcoming program in Kerala called the 'hindu
sAdhu mahAsammelaNam' an 100 year old tradition initiated in Kerala by
Chattambi Swami and others for protecting the sanAtana dharma in the state
of Keralam which as we all know is in vulnerable position.

Any grantha references and mantras and soecific past precedents related to
'worship of sannyAsins by grihasthas and the phala of such worship' is most
welcome.

Om

Raghav
