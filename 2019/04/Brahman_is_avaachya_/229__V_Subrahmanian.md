Dear Sri Srinivasamurthy,

You have  a valid point. When we bring up pramana-s from many sources, not
just the Upanishads, we are able to show that the Vedantic stand on this
topic has sound scriptural basis.  This is required both for the Advaitic
sadhaka and to respond to those non-adivaitins. who are opposed to this
idea that only Shankara Bhagavatpada has highlighted.

warm regards
subbu
