Dear Subbu garu,                It is indeed Reality. Thank you for the Link. As dreams only can bring little success or keeps positivity otherwise everything is sunyam. As you said birth and death are an illusion which we will come to know at the last breath before this physical body. I completely read this article and it is quire informative & useful.regardsKameswara

//The concept of awakening is predicated on the idea that before he became
the Buddha, Gautama was in some sense asleep and dreaming. This trope is at
the heart of Buddhism and even appears in the Upanishads, a collection of
Sanskrit texts that predate Buddhism by centuries. The conviction that
birth and death are an illusion (Skt., maya) has served as the pivot point
around which turn all the philosophies and practices that make up the
spiritual life of India. //
