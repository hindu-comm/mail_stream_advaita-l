Dear Friends,

All beings arehaving two natures. Thefirst one isintrinsic nature whichneither appears or disappears.The second one is adventiousone which appearsand disappears. The intrinsicone is one’strue svarUpa whereas theadventious is not 

his truesvarUpa.



Mantra 2-1-4 ofKathopanishad utilizes theexperiences of wakingand dream which happento all to allhuman beings andhelps one to recognize/discover one’s intrinsicnature which ismahAntam. viBum and AtmAnam.The following studymaterial which isbased on Upanishadsreveals the methodologyin detail.



Let us comparewaking and dream. 

The resemblance betweenthe two statesis so completethat 

we must confessthey cannot beidentified severally by 

distict marks wheneach presents itselfseverally by 

distinct markswhen each presentsitself to ourexperience.

We might goeven so faras to thinkthat the action of the

dream-mind beingso faint wasquite different fromthe waking-mind. 

BUT ARE THETWO EGOS SAME? 

When he wakes,behold! He findshimself transformed 

into the wakingego with relationsto another 

world nowwith other interests. 

He recollects hisdream and hasa hearty laugh 

at itsillusive shows. 

WHAT THENIS THE COMMONELEMENT IN BOTH? 

Not the physicalbody, the senses,the mind, 


the objects or eventhe ego , 


for the behaviourof the mindand the senses


was peculiar ineach stateand 


the bodyand objects werecertainly not identical.

The only commonand constant factorin both is 

LIFE orUNDIFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. 

One who cognizesthe above statedfacts of life 

within himself byhimself will be 

an Atmavit /Atmajnani.

Thus taught myRevered Guru.

With respectful namaskars,

Sreenivasa Murthy.

//The concept of awakening is predicated on the idea that before he became
the Buddha, Gautama was in some sense asleep and dreaming. This trope is at
the heart of Buddhism and even appears in the Upanishads, a collection of
Sanskrit texts that predate Buddhism by centuries. The conviction that
birth and death are an illusion (Skt., maya) has served as the pivot point
around which turn all the philosophies and practices that make up the
spiritual life of India. //
