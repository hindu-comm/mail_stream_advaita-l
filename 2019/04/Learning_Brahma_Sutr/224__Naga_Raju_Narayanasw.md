Dear All,
Can you please recommend which Sankara's commentary translation of Brahma
Sutras is amenable for a student of Advaita? I see couple of books from RK
Mutt, V Panoli's book available as well as other authors. I prefer a
english translation.

I prefer a online or in person class, but I think it is difficult to find a
right Guri in this day and age for learning Brahma Sutras. If any of you
have pointers for a class, please let me know, I am in the California bay
area.

Thanks,
Naga
