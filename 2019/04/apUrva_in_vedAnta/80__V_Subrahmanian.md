Dear Anand ji,

Can we equate the 'dharma' of the Purva mimamsa with ishwara? This is
because they admit that 'dharma' is something that is produced anew upon a
karma being performed. With this idea alone in the Brahma sutra 'tattu
samanvayat' Brahman is distinguished from dharma and presented as 'siddha
vastu'.  And their idea that all vedic passages are karma-bodhaka/prayojaka
and therefore siddha vastu bodhaka passages are to be seen as arthavada or
'anarthaka', devoid of meaning/prayojanam. And they also accept that dharma
perishes after the phala is experienced.
