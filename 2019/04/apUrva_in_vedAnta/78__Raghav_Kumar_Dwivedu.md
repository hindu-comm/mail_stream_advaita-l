Namaste Anand ji
Apologies for intruding but I was reminded of the following passage from
Kena ३.१२

बीजक्षेत्रसंस्कारपरिरक्षाविज्ञानवत्कर्त्रपेक्षफलं कृष्यादि,
विज्ञानवत्सेव्यबुद्धिसंस्कारापेक्षफलं च सेवादि । यागादेः
कर्मणस्तथाविज्ञानवत्कर्त्रपेक्षफलत्वानुपपत्तौ
कालान्तरफलत्वात्कर्मदेशकालनिमित्तविपाकविभागज्ञबुद्धिसंस्कारापेक्षं फलं
भवितुमर्हति, सेवादिकर्मानुरूपफलज्ञसेव्यबुद्धिसंस्कारापेक्षफलस्येव ।
तस्मात्सिद्धः सर्वज्ञ ईश्वरः सर्वजन्तुबुद्धिकर्मफलविभागसाक्षी
सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा ।

Can we say that this idea of sevyabuddhi saMskAra of Ishvara is a suitably
modified idea of the apUrva of the mImAmsakas? Given that both (apUrva and
Ishvara's samskAra ) represent a kind of avyakta entity which is a
necessary intermediate entity to connect karma and karmaphala across time,
space and even possibly  janma)?

Raghav
