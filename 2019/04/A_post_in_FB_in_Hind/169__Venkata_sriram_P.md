Namaste,

Adhyatma Ramayana is the vedantic interpretation of Valmiki Ramayana.

Mother Sita says:

एवमादीनि कर्माणि मयैवाचरितान्यपि आरोपयन्ति रामेऽस्मिन्निर्विकारेऽखिलात्मनि । 
रामो न गच्छति न तिष्ठति नानुशोचत्याकाङ्शते त्यजति नो न करोति किञ्चित् ।

All these accomplishments, though done by Me, were superimposed on Rama;
in fact, Rama is the Absolute Principle, the Changeless Entity who neither walks, 
neither sits; nor does has any sorrow. He desires not; abandons not; there is no trace 
of any activity in Him; As He is the Substratum of mAyA; there is neither movement \
nor transformation in Him.

rgs,
sriram
