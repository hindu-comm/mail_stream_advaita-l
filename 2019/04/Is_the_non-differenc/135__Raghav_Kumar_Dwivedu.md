Namaste Bhaskarji and Venkatraghavan ji

Bhaskarji wrote-

"Anyway, kArya-kAraNa prakriya is there to prove brahman is in his svarUpa
atyanta nirvishesha".

Is the kArya-kAraNa ananyatva nyAya alone *sufficient* to arrive at
nirvisheSha brahman? Or is it necessary but *not sufficient* to arrive at
nirvisheSha brahman?

 I think Sri Venkatraghavan ji suggested it's not enough. But maybe this
has been discussed before...if so, I shall be happy if either of you remind
me of the earlier discussion on this question.

Raghav
