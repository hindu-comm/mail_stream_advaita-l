As far as other school, both the paxa -- universe being a modification of
Brahman's form  and Brahman being adhishthanam of illusion -- are quite
shruti virOdha and rejected wholesale

Both pariNAma and viavarta vaada are rejected in the Mandukya Upanishad:

vibhUtiM prasavaM tvanye manyante sR^ishhTichintakAH |
svapnamAyA sarUpeti sR^ishhTiranyairvikalpitA |
ichchhAmAtraM prabhoH sR^ishhTiriti sR^ishhTau vinishchitAH ||

Some people, in consideration of sR^ishhTi, think it as being a
modification (prasavaM) of Brahman's own form (vibhUti). Others imagine it
as being akin (sarUpa) to the illusion of a
dream (svapnamAyA). However, it is established (vinishchitAH) that Creation
is solely by the Lord's own Will (ichchhAmAtraM prabhoH).
