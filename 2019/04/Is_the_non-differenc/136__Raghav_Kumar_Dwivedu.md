Namaste Chandramouli ji

You had suggested (rightly) to not conflate adhiShThAna-adhiShTheya
sambandha (rope snake) with kAraNa-kArya (clay pot) sambandha.

Are there examples where there are two entities which enjoy the
adhiShThAna-adhiShTheya sambandha without any kAraNa-kArya sambandha
between them ? (Be it either pariNami or vivarta upAdAna kAraNam)

Also is it incorrect to refer to the clay, the upAdana kAraNam as
'adhiShThAnam' of the pot?

Any errors in my question formulation or terminology may be pointed out...
:)

Thank you in advance

Om
Raghav
