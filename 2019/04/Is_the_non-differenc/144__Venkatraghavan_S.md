I am not sure where I suggested this. I may have said that once kArya's
mithyAtva is understood, we can drop the kAraNatva of the parama kAraNa
also.

Anyway coming to the specific question, one can arrive at nirvisheSha
sadrUpa brahman through kArya kArana ananyatva nyAya - to be specific, if
we understand kArya kAraNa ananyatva as kAraNa vyatirekena kAryasya
anupalabdhi, we can arrive at sat. More details can be found in the bhAShya
for Gita 2.16 and accompanying Anandagiri TIkA. We know how seminal the
bhAShya is, the TIkA adds significant depth to the analysis and provides
the link from kArya kAraNa ananyatva to sad Brahman.
