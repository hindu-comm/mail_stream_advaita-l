In the Vishnu sahasra nama bhashya, Sri Bhagavatpada has cited a large number of passages to deny  the five types of differences (that non-advaitins, especially Madhvas, admit in absolute terms). These are:
jiveshvara bheda, jiva-jiva bheda, jiva-jaDa bheda, jaDa-jaDa bheda and jaDeshvara bheda.

praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Were these, tattva vAda type of pancha bedha-s, existed during the time of shankara to refute them in his commentary  ??  I donâ€™t think so.  Anyway, please clarify.
