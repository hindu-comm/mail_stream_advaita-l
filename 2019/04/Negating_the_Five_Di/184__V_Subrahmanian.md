In the Vishnu sahasra nama bhashya, Sri Bhagavatpada has cited a large
number of passages to deny  the five types of differences (that
non-advaitins, especially Madhvas, admit in absolute terms). These are:
jiveshvara bheda, jiva-jiva bheda, jiva-jaDa bheda, jaDa-jaDa bheda and
jaDeshvara bheda.  The images for these citations are presented in the file
that can be downloaded here:
