Bhaskar ji,

Bheda is not a new concept. In fact Madhvacharyaru has cited a shruti verse
in support if the five bhedas. We have no access to that shruti though.
These bhedas are not special. All of us experience the bhedas in our daily
life. Advaita holds that bheda darshanam is avidyakrutam and atmikatva
Jnanam is the dispeller of this avidya.

Regards
Subbu
