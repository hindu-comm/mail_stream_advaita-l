Since you have not read the article that I had attached, you are not able
to appreciate the refutation. Shankara shows shruti/smriti vakya-s for the
refutation of all the types of bheda-s. Of course, he does not name each of
the bheda-s but names just two: jiveshvara bheda and jiva-jiva bheda by
implication. The other types of bheda-s get negated by the various vakya-s
he cites.
