Namaste

The Advaiti reasoning in the video is not correct. Because Madhvas say we
all are Jeevas only but there is gradation of Jeevas. Some Jeevas are
higher and some Jeevas are lower. There are also the lowest Jeevas like the
Nitya Samsaris. They will never get Moksha. Similarly there are some
highest Jeevas like Lakshmi and Vaayu Devaru. Vaayu Devaru is Jeevottama.
He is the best Jeeva. Madhvacharya is Avatara of Vaayu Devaru only.
Therefore he can be Jagadguru. Because he is the higher than all Jeevas in
the world.

Jagadguru has to higher than all Jeevas. He may not be God. This is
according to them and reasoning is correct for them.
