 Excellent reasoning!    On Thursday, April 11, 2019, 11:13:00 AM PDT, V Subrahmanian via Advaita-l <advaita-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org> wrote:  

 A short animated debate in Sanskrit-Hindi.

It is a debate on 'whether Shankaracharya alone can be 'Jagadguru'. I
don't see nyaya shaastra here. The sannyasi says, rather reasons: For us,
Krishna is Jagadguru. And Shankaracharya alone can be Jagadguru and
Ramanuja and Madhva can't. Reason: Shankara's realization is 'aham brahma
asmi'. Brahman alone can be jagadguru, same as Krishna. But in Ramanuja and
Madhva, their realization is never 'aham brahma' but 'aham jiva alone.'
How can jiva be jagadguru? This is the line of argument.
