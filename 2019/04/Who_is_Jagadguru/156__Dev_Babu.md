Yes, the debate is not well construued.
The word "Jagadguru" means Jagata: Guru:  -one who is the Guru for the
whole World.
When we, advaitaitins have established Jangan Mithya,
then, it becomes MithyAyA: Guru
Then, the word Guru itself becomes Mithya.

Which Shankara has also confirmed in His Nivana Shaktkam sh.5, (na Guro na
Shishya: -- chidAnanda Rupo ShivOham ShivOham)

So, the word Jagadguru can only be taken in VyAVaharika Dhristi, that is
why we have 4 Jagadgurus for 4 Shankacharya Peetam.

So, If Ramanuja or Madhwacharya followers were to consider their Gurus as
Jagadguru, it is fine from their perspective of Shishyas
