 Dear friends.
 "I AM" alone is jagadguru because "I AM" appearsas jagat and 'me'. There is no second conscious entityother than "I AM". Please refer to mantras 3-7-23 and 3-8-11 of Bruhadaranyaka Upanishad.
In the light of the teachings of Upanishads 
actually and factually no name and form (entity) 
can be a jagadguru!
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy

 A short animated debate in Sanskrit-Hindi.

It is a debate on 'whether Shankaracharya alone can be 'Jagadguru'. I
don't see nyaya shaastra here. The sannyasi says, rather reasons: For us,
Krishna is Jagadguru. And Shankaracharya alone can be Jagadguru and
Ramanuja and Madhva can't. Reason: Shankara's realization is 'aham brahma
asmi'. Brahman alone can be jagadguru, same as Krishna. But in Ramanuja and
Madhva, their realization is never 'aham brahma' but 'aham jiva alone.'
How can jiva be jagadguru? This is the line of argument.

subbu
