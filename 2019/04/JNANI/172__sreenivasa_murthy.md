Dear friends,
I came across with aninteresting reading material.

The author was a discipleof Sri Bhagavan Ramna and Sri Atmananda.

Please permit me to sharewith you.



QUOTE:

So there isno such thing as asage, a free man.

If I may put it this way; 

from his own point of viewhe is freedom itself, not abody. 

But if the visitor sees abody and calls that a sage or a guru, 
it is because he believes that he himself is a man or a woman, 
and hesees others on the corresponding level.

The moment you discover,un-cover, freedom within yourself, 

you see that you are oneand the same freedom as the sage is. 

There is only one freedom,only one absolute, or, 

in the language of images,there is only one infinite. 

The sage is that.

YOUARE THAT, Not as a personality, 

but as that in whichhundreds and thousands of personalities 

and egos arise anddissolve, Whether you call them by your name or 

by other names.

[WOLTER KEERS]
