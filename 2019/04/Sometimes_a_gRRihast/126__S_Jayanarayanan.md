The GYAnimAtra will eventually assume vidvat-sannyAsa as a matter of course.

However, not everyone should take up sannyAsa - in fact, doing so without vairAgya is considered
detrimental! These are the many levels below the jIvanmukta = sthitapraGYa, in order of rank
(i.e. #1 is superior to #2, and so on):

1. Vidvat-sannyAsin (sannyAsin with GYAna).
2. GYAnimAtra (a gRRihastha or brahmachArin with GYAna).
3. vividiShA-sannyAsin (sannyAsin possessing vairAgya).
4. A gRRihastha or brahmachArin following dharma (with no vairAgya or GYAna).
5. markaTa-sannyAsin (without vairAgya or GYAna - something like a "yoga-bhraShTa").

Note that if one has GYAna, it is better to be a sannyAsin than a gRRihastha (#1 > #2).
OTOH, if one does not have GYAna or vairAgya, being a dhArmic gRRihastha is far superior (#4 > #5)!
The last kind (#5) is unworthy and should be avoided at all costs. The Gita provides an example of
Arjuna being advised to NOT take up sannyAsa.

Here's a thumb-rule of sorts when taking such "sannyAsa" decisions:
If one truly possesses vairAgya, the Wise will observe this and confer sannyAsa on the deserving person.
If that does not happen, one should continue to perform Vedic rituals without desire ("Karma-Yoga") until
vairAgya (or GYAna) is attained.
