Thank you Akhilesh ji for letting us know that Rupert Spira had familiarity
with the Advaita teaching through a student of the Shankaracharya.

The way Sreenivasa Murthy ji asserted that Rupert Spira had not done any
Advaita study, I thought he definitely knew Rupert personally!!

I also noted the following, from the net.

"Spira is married to Ellen Emmett, a therapist and *yoga instructor in the
non-dual tradition* of Kashmir Shaivism
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Shaivism>."

I admit it's speculative here given that Kashmir Shaivism is not identical
to Shaankara vedAnta but I do wonder ....because we do find the spouse
becoming the Guru as in the brihadaranyaka Upanishad!

Om
Raghav
