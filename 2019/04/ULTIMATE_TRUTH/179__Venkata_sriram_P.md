Raghav ji,

..........................
Rupert Spira had familiarity with the Advaita teaching 
.................

These people come to India, learn from Indian masters but unfortunately never
care to acknowledge Indian Wisdom and Indian Teachers under whom they 
learnt.  

They go back to their own countries and start their own branches and 
teach as if the knowledge to them has come out of the blue from heaven !

Why doesn't Mr. Mark S. G. Dyczkowski or anybody else for that matter,
first display a photograph on their website prostrating their preceptors. 

I respect and have regard for their hard work, commitment etc. but somehow
they have an attitude problem in respecting Indians and Indian masters without
whom they would not have risen to such stature. 

Such persons are counted in fingers like David Frawley (Vamadeva Shastry) etc. 

rgs,
sriram
