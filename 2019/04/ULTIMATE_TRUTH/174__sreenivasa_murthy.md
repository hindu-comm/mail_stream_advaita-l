Dear friends,
Sri Rupert Spira says : "Just as the screen is intimately one 
with all images and, at the same time, 
free of them, so "I", the light of 
pure Knowing, am one with all 
experiences and yet at the same 
time inherently free of them."
Is not this teaching same as that of 
Bruhadaranyaka Upanishad "asaMgO hi ayaM purushaH" 
and Sri Shankara's statement " AtmA sarvagatatvAt 
sarvAnanyatvAcca"?
The reader may kindly note that Sri Rupert Spira, 
an Englishman, has not studied any vedanta texts 
nor has read Sri Shankara's commentaries. 
Yet his statements are nothing but the teachings 
of Upanishads and Sri Shankara. How to account for this?This clearly shows that Atmajnana is universal andnot the monopoly of a country, sect or any Matha.

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
