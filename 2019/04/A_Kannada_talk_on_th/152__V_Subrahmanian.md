Similarities and Differences between Dvaita, Advaita and Visishtadvaita

The scholar says: jivas are all 'god' (26..minutes in the video). This is
not correct as per Advaita. God is not Brahman in the expression 'jivo
brahmaiva naaparah.' God is Ishwara in Advaita, sarvajna, sarvashakta,
jagat kaaranam, niyantaa. jiva is not Ishwara. The scholar seems to be
unaware of this distinction. He also says Buddhism also says this. But do
Buddhists say 'jiva is Brahman?'
