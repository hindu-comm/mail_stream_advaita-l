Yes, these examples are persuasive as to Sankara's overall view. But in the
Aitaraya excerpts *specifically* he seems to be saying something different.
He poses no exceptions and does not soften his language. He does not say
it's merely *beneficial* to take sannyasa; he says in no other station is
sadhana *possible*.

It's also says -- and this is very interesting -- that a jnani, whatever
his ashrama was before, *always* becomes a sannyasi, because to stay a
householder requires desire that is no longer present post-jnana.

Again, these are very cut-and-dry, definitive statements.

You can certainly and correctly bring up counterexamples -- no doubt -- but
this particular text seems quite rigid, that's all I'm saying. So perhaps
bhAshyakAra is a touch inconsistent.
