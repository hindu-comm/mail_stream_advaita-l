Hari Om Bhaskar ji,

Bhashyakara says in Gita Bhashya, "मुमुक्षो: सर्वकर्मसंन्यासविधानात्" -- So
first thing first, Bhashyakara has clearly and unequivocally stated that
sks is a vidhana for Mumukshu. It is an injunction. A vidhi. And it is for
one and all who is yet not 'attained' Moksha, there are no exceptions. Your
reliance on Vamdeva etc to infer the dispensability of sks is direct
contradiction with this statement of Bhashyakara. So, there has to other
interpretation of Vamdeva etc.

Regards
Sudhanshu.
