Hari Om Bhaskar ji,

1. Vidhana and Vidhi are one and the same.

2. Please see Chhandogya 2.23.1 comprehensively. This very objection that
anyone else other than a parivrajaka can have Moksha is refuted by
Bhagvatpada. I quote the following Bhashya Vakyas:-

Bhagvatpada's Answer ( I am making relevant words Bold)-

(i) ‡§∏ ‡§ö ‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§• ‡§â‡§ö‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ; ‡§∏ ‡§ö *‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§°‡•á‡§µ*, *‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç
- Only Parivrajaka, for this is impossible for anyone else.*

(ii) To set aside any confusion on the meaning of the word Parivrajaka,
Acharya says - ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç *‡§≠‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Å‡§∞‡•á‡§ï ‡§è‡§µ ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ü‡•ç , ‡§®
‡§ó‡•É‡§π‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø‡§É - So reading the above two together, Bhikshu alone can be
Brahma-Samstha and none else. Please keep the opponent's word that there is
no mention in Shastra that Parivrajaka alone can have Moksha and none else.
Acharya is repudiating that.*

*(iii) *‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§Ç ‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ *‡§≠‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Å‡§ï ‡§è‡§µ ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§•* ‡§á‡§§‡§ø -
Therefore it is proved that Bhikshuka *ALONE is Brahma-samstha.*

*(iv) *‡§ï‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ? *‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§ï‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§µ *‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§≠‡•á‡§¶‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§•
*‡§§‡§æ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç* - note the emphasis by way of 'EVA'.

(v) ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§£‡§ú‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡•à‡§ï‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡§µ‡§§ ‡§è‡§µ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§≤‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§£‡§Ç

Your reliance on "‡§è‡§§‡•á‡§® ‡§ó‡•É‡§π‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§ï‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§Æ‡•ç"
to infer that grihastha can also have Moksha without sks is misplaced.
There is a time lag between jnana-prapti and Moksha as has been repeated
several times by Bhashyakara in Prasthantrayibhashya (PTB). The sequence is
mentioned in Gita Bhashya 5.12 -
karma-yoga--sattva-shuddhi--jnana-prapti---sarva-karma-sanyasa---jnana-nishtha---Moksha.
You may also note that as explained in Gita Bhashya 5th chapter, there is
an option between karma-yoga and karma-sanyasa (not sarva-karma-sanyasa.
SKS is mandatory, ks is optional). Therefore, it boils down that
"jnana-prapti" can be there for grihastha and in fact of all varna and
ashrama but not Moksha. Moksha is ONLY through sarva-karma-sanyasa and sks
(ks too) is only for Brahmana. //‡§è‡§§‡•á‡§® ‡§ó‡•É‡§π‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§ï‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡§§‡§ø

event of advent of ekatva-vijnana, he has to resort to parivrajyam.

This is the unambiguous clear cut import of Bhashya-vakyas wherein Acharya
has unambiguously stated that only Parivrajaka, who is a Bhikshu and NOT a
grihastha, can have Moksha.

Therefore, the reliance on Vamdeva, Janaka etc to infer that
non-parivrajaka can have Moksha is misplaced. Those need to be understood
in other manner.

Regards,
Sudhanshu.
