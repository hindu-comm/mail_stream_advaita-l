Sankara does not accept Vidura and Janaka as *muktas*, only as GYAnIs;
as sannyAsa is a requirement for mukti (or mokSha), not GYAna.

There is absolutely no contradiction here:

 Vidura, Janaka: gRRihasthas and GYAnimAtras (NOT jIvanmuktas)
 yAGyavalkya: vidvat-sannyAsin and sthitapraGYa (jIvanmukta)
