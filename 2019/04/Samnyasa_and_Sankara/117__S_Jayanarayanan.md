Where in the above quoted BU passage, or Sankara's commentary thereon, does it say that
Janaka or yAGYavalkya were *muktas*? They were GYAnIs, but not jIvanmuktas - at least
not until yAGYavalkya took up vidvat-sannyAsa.
I thought you were aware of the differences between a GYAnimAtra and the sthitapraGYa:

GYAnimAtra: BrahmaGYAna is aparokSha (Direct) and saMyak (Perfect), but asthitaM (*Unsteady*).
sthitapraGYa: BrahmaGYAna is aparokSha (Direct) and saMyak (Perfect), AND sthitaM (*Steady*).
