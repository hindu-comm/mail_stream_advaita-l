Namaste Chandramouliji,

I think by this last passage he just means to say that the example of
householder sages can never show that the doing of rites or a sense of
doership ever *combine* with knowledge to cause liberation. That does not
mean these individuals were not fully liberated, nor that the householder
mode of life prohibits the acquisition of brahma jnana. Knowledge alone
liberates, not karma, but that does not mean ashrama sannyasa required for
the highest knowledge.

In the commentary at the end of Mundaka at 3.2.11, Sankara says of
"parama-rsibhyah" -- "those great seers, starting with Brahma, through whom
that knowledge was successively handed down..." which clearly includes
householders, that they in fact "directly saw and realized Brahman."
