Namaste Bhaskarji,

May I ask how you would interpret the Aitareya introduction excerpts that I
posted? I would be quite interested to know. Particularly these quotes:

*Not so... the constant habit of resorting to any particular house of one's
own is prompted by desire. When there is no clinging to any particular
house of one's own, there follows begging alone, as a matter of course...*

and

*From the fact that a fresh injunction of renunciation, despite its
emergence as a matter of course (as in the case of a man of illumination),
is met with [footnote: In Br. Up. III v. I. etc. -- 'Knowing this very
Self, the Brahmanas renounce...and lead a mendicant life."] ,it becomes
evident that it is obligatory for the man of illumination. And monasticism
is obligatory even for the unillumined soul that hankers after
emancipation. ... Besides, such means for the realization of the Self as
physical and mental control etc. are incompatible with other stages of
life."*

It seems that Sankara is saying that both jnanis and seekers -- the jnanis
because they lack desire and it will be automatic; the second because
physical/mental control are not otherwise possible -- must undertake
sannyasa. No?
