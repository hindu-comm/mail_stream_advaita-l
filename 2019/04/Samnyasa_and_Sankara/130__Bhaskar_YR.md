How about karma phala tyAga done by gruhastha which lord depicts in 4th chapter ??  

Yasya sarve samAraMbhAH kAma saMkalpa varjitAH, jnAnAgnidagdha karmANaMtamAhuH paNditaM budhAH and we can take the reference of next verse as well : tyaktvA karmaphalAsaMgaM, nitya truptO nirAshrayaH karmaNyabhipravruttOpi naiva kiMchitkarOti saH...And we can take next couple of verses meant for sanyasi-s üòä  bhAshya on these verses would be a sound reference to understand jnAni-s from different Ashrama-s üòä 

Lot to discuss but no time at office, shall see if possible tomorrow üòä 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

Namaste Venkataraghavan ji,

The apt example for such grihastha would be :

 Namaste Sriram
 ji,I know it is said in a lighter vein, but isn't  the real sannyAsa to contemplate upon the question - who is  the one getting pestered, by whom?
 Taking up sannyAsa to avoid getting
 pestered is an exercise in futility, because even if one  takes sannyAsa from grihasthAshrama, the one taking such a  sannyAsa - the body and the mind - cannot take sannyAsa from  prArabdha. That will continue to affect the body and mind  even after.
 Therefore, the only true sannyAsa is
 the sannyAsa from body identification, and there is nothing  to stop that even now. May we have the strength and  perseverance to train our mind to think on those  lines.
 As long as the
 body is in grihasthAshrama, let it serve those that are  dependent upon it. When they have no use for it, let it seek  their permission to drop the relations and take up  sannyAsa.

 Kind
 regards,Venkatraghavan

 Namaste Praveenji,



 On a lighter vein :



 ....................

 The pUrvapakSha is also very straightforward in terms of  gRhasta

 continuing to stay at home after jnAna

 ................



 Even if you want to stay at home after jnAna, your wife  & children wont

 let you stay ....wife will pester for vegetables, milk  packets, curd and groceries

 and your kids would pester for outing :)



 Hence, better to take vidwat-sanyAsa post jnAna for  jnAna-niSTa ...



 rgs,

 sriram
