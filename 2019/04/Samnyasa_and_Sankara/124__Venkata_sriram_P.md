Namaste Praveenji,

On a lighter vein :

....................
The pUrvapakSha is also very straightforward in terms of gRhasta
continuing to stay at home after jnAna
................

Even if you want to stay at home after jnAna, your wife & children wont 
let you stay ....wife will pester for vegetables, milk packets, curd and groceries
and your kids would pester for outing :)

Hence, better to take vidwat-sanyAsa post jnAna for jnAna-niSTa ...

rgs,
sriram
