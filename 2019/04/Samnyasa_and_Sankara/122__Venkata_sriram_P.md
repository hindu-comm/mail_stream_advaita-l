Namaste,

........................
Globalization and Materialism is killing all cultures and philosophies. 
Everybody or 99.9999% people will become Materialist only or Pracchanna Materialist.
...................

Studying philosophy is one part and putting it into practice is another part.

Having BMW A/c car for sanchAra; personal attendants carrying portable 
table fans that accompany like daNDa & kamaNDala; the riches around ;
VIP treatments to ministers, goondaas having political clout etc. stand to 
the testimony that even sanyAsis are under the sway of kali-prabhAva.  

Now, where exactly the BG shloka fits in :

मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदुःखदाः।
आगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत।।2.14।।

When the sanyasis themselves can't practice the forbearance (तितिक्षा), 
where is the sanctity of ashrama-dharma which are getting 
diluted day by day. 

Considering the present circumstances, being a 'gruhastha' is the
safest one given the freedom of enjoying family life yoked to dharma;
doing anuSTAna with bhakti & prapatti. 

rgs,
sriram
