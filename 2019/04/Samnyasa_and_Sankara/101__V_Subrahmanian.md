The shruti passage quoted above has been interpreted differently by two
authorities:

In the Jivanmukti viveka, Sri Vidyaranya takes this passage as authority
for vidvat sannyasa.  In the gloss to the Brihadaranyaka Bhashya for this
passage, Sri Anandagiri says 'this is a reference to paroksha jnana.'  I
had pointed out this remark by Anandagiri ( I think in two places) to
renowned scholars some years back. Members here may please verify the above
and give their opinion.
