Namaste

Nice article. But there is one thing to think deeply in this sentence -
>Adherents of all creeds, except the materialists, who believe
  in liberation are not able to disagree with the activities of
  a Yogi. Globalization and Materialism is killing all cultures and
philosophies. Everybody or 99.9999% people will become Materialist only or
Pracchanna Materialist. A man will outwardly be Advaiti, Dvaiti, Jaina,
Buddhist and so on but inside he will be Materialist 100%. The Mathas and
Temples are also Materialist. If you give money you can have any Darshan
like Swamiji or God fast. No money means you wait in long que or No
Darshan. Everything is running on Money, Money and Money. If Swami
Vidyaranya was alive today he would give different advice - how to not
become a Materialist and become Astika. He will not talk about Jnani and
Sanyasa. This is the basic step. Turn away from Materialism. But it is very
very very very very difficult for 99.9999999% people today. Parents are
responsible for spoiling children and making them Materialists. In
childhood they put pressure to get high marks in school, then to join
lucrative job. What is all this? Money is the most important thing. With
Money enjoy life. Therefore kindly answer - How to become Astika and not a
Materialist? People are very very far from becoming even Astikas. Then they
have to become Jnani Matra. Then they have to take Sanyasa. The journey is
very long.
