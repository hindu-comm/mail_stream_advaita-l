Namaste,

Incidentally, I began studying Aitareya a while back and these very
sentences grasped me as well, as being extremely clear on the subject
matter. The pUrvapakSha is also very straightforward in terms of gRhasta
continuing to stay at home after jnAna and is undoubtedly refuted by
Bhagavan Bhashyakara. Sannyasa is also said to be a natural result of
jnAna.

I wanted to reply earlier but I'm traveling even now and can't quote
anything.
