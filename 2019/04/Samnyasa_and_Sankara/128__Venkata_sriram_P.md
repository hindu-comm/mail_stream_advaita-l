Namaste,

True...

In whatever Ashrama you are, these two are the crux viz., मत्परः &  मच्चित्तः 

चेतसा सर्वकर्माणि मयि संन्यस्य मत्परः।
बुद्धियोगमुपाश्रित्य मच्चित्तः सततं भव ।।

When you have the above two, then whatever karma you do, it comes in the purview of 'a-karma' only.

कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः।
स बुद्धिमान् मनुष्येषु स युक्तः कृत्स्नकर्मकृत्।।

But the problem is that sort of चित्तदार्ढ्यं is extremely difficult for grihasthAs with various obligations 
related to ashrama-dharma.

rgs,
sriram

 Namaste Sriram
 ji,I know it is said in a lighter vein, but isn't
 the real sannyAsa to contemplate upon the question - who is
 the one getting pestered, by whom?
 Taking up sannyAsa to avoid getting
 pestered is an exercise in futility, because even if one
 takes sannyAsa from grihasthAshrama, the one taking such a
 sannyAsa - the body and the mind - cannot take sannyAsa from
 prArabdha. That will continue to affect the body and mind
 even after.
 Therefore, the only true sannyAsa is
 the sannyAsa from body identification, and there is nothing
 to stop that even now. May we have the strength and
 perseverance to train our mind to think on those
 lines.
 As long as the
 body is in grihasthAshrama, let it serve those that are
 dependent upon it. When they have no use for it, let it seek
 their permission to drop the relations and take up
 sannyAsa.

 Kind
 regards,Venkatraghavan

 Namaste Praveenji,



 On a lighter vein :



 ....................

 The pUrvapakSha is also very straightforward in terms of
 gRhasta

 continuing to stay at home after jnAna

 ................



 Even if you want to stay at home after jnAna, your wife
 & children wont 

 let you stay ....wife will pester for vegetables, milk
 packets, curd and groceries

 and your kids would pester for outing :)



 Hence, better to take vidwat-sanyAsa post jnAna for
 jnAna-niSTa ...



 rgs,

 sriram
