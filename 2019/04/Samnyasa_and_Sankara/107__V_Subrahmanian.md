The bhashya for the specific part of Br.Up.3.5.1 is:

तद्बलेन हि व्युत्थानम् , ‘एतं वै तमात्मानं विदित्वा’ (बृ. उ. ३ । ५ । १)
<http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/display/bhashya/Brha?page=3&id=BR_C03_S05_V01&hl=%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%82%20%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%88%20%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%82%20%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE>
इति
विशेषवचनात् । तस्मात् त्रिभ्योऽप्येतेभ्यः अनात्मलोकप्राप्तिसाधनेभ्यः
एषणाविषयेभ्यो व्युत्थाय —

For the above, Sri Anandagiri says:  इतश्च ब्रह्मविद्या
दैवाद्वित्ताद्बहिरेवेत्याह - तद्बलेनेति |  प्रागेव वेदनं सिद्धं चेत्किं
पुनर्व्युत्थानेनेत्याशङ्क्य   प्रयोजकज्ञानं तत्प्रयोजकमुद्देश्यं तु
तत्त्वसाक्षात्करणमिति विवक्षित्वा आह - तस्मादिति | प्रयोजकज्ञानं
पञ्चम्यर्थः | व्युत्थाय भिक्षाचर्यं चरन्तीत्यर्थः |

The meaning of the above gloss is: For this reason too, Brahmavidyaa is
outside the realm of daiva vitta (upasana). If knowledge is firm/attained
already (before itself), what is the purpose/use of renouncing? To this
question / doubt / objection, the Bhashyakara replies -
[therefore/thereafter] this knowledge that they have at present is
something that will result in a yet to be attained result (prayojaka
jnaanam). That result (prayojyam/uddeshyam) that is intended to be attained
is: tattva saakshaatkaaram. With this purport in mind the Bhashyakaara says
tasmaat, thereafter/thence.  prayojaka jnaanam is the subject matter of
this panchami word 'tasmaat'.

From the gloss of Anandagiri it is clear that the 'Knowing' is not the
direct realization of the Self but something, a knowledge that is yet to
result in direct realization. That pre-realization knowledge is the one
that triggers the renouncing of the means to attain this and other worldly
goals.
