Namaste Bhaskar ji,

The Vishnu Purana has not denied Brahman that is beyond the Trimurti-s. It
only says that the Trimurti-s are non-different from Brahman.  This is
quite in order. Bhakti is done towards that entity, by whatever name it is
called, that is Para Brahman, which is free from vastu-pariccheda.
Shankara, in the very beginning of his bhashya to the Vishnu Sahasra Nama
says for the mangala shloka:

jagatprabhum devadevam anantham purushottamam.....that anantam is trividha
pariccheda shunyam.  Thereby he is making clear that the subject matter of
the VSN is Brahman of this description and not any paricchinna entity
called Vishnu that is different from Brahmaa and Rudra.

So, there is ample room for bhakti towards Brahman through whatever
name/form one might find attractive. Hence it is not atheism.

regards
subbu
