 Dear friends,Quote:2. The  Trimurtis are mere names such as Brahma, Vishnu, etc.
4. There are no real entities such as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, and others too.
8. Even Vishnu of the Trimurtis is only kalpita name/form/sattva guna Unquote.
The  above  teaching  is  meant  only  for  mumukshus whose goal  is  paramArthasatya alone and want  to  be  Atmavit .It is not  meant  for  all the  students  of  Vedanta or general public. They should  not  be  given  from  a  public platform. It  should  be  shared  in  person  depending  onthe  competency  of  the  student.
Thus taught  my Revered  Guru.

IMO, even jnana mArga mOkshArthi-s should not think that all deva-devata-s are mere imaginary characters and not real entities.  Otherwise they will become nereeshwara vAdins and dry philosophers.  Even to get Advaita vAsana we should have IshvarAnugraha says gaudapAda.  Ofcourse, krishna says he is the giver of fruits to both jnAni and yOgi.  Ishwara praNidAna / sharaNAgati, saguNOPAsana, parAbhakti  etc.  has its own significance in jnana mArga as well.  Hence Sri SSS says somewhere,  shankara bhagavatpAda considered as saint not a dry philosopher or mere logician.  How can we forget bhAshyakAra's assurance :  IshwavarAnugraha hetukenaiva cha vijnAnena mOkshasiddhIrbhavitumarhati in sUtra bhAshya ??  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
