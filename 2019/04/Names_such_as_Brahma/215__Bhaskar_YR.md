2. The  Trimurtis are mere names such as Brahma, Vishnu, etc.
4. There are no real entities such as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, and others too.
8. Even Vishnu of the Trimurtis is only kalpita name/form/sattva guna

Not for any debates, just curious to know, how the interpretations like above are anything different from nireeshwara vAda of sAnkhya ??  Donâ€™t you think by reading the statements like above the neophyte in advaita will come to the wrong conclusion that there is no place for bhakti, upAsana of  Ishwara (saguNa / sOpAdhika brahma) in Advaita and the all deva / devata-s are mere imagination of ??? ( I donâ€™t know in whose imagination)  atheism is what Advaita propagating here??  Ofcourse, Shruti says : atra deva adevAH etc.  this holds good only and only if there is absolute realization of abedha ( kshetrajna and ishwara abedha)  even in that realization also the 'tattva' behind it is realized by accepting the upAdhi vishesha of Ishwara.  By saying all these are mere imagination, we are belittling and doubting  the importance of bhakti, upAsana, saguNOpAsana, archana, krama mukti etc.  

I take your words in reply as your final stand with regard to kalpita trimurthy-s / deva-s in Advaita ðŸ˜Š

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
