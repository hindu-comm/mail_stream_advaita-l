Please see the text from Kena Upanishad quoted by Raghavji. The analogy
used in Kena is that of master-servant. Just as service rendered to a
master by a servant creates an impression in the  mind of the master, who
then rewards the servant accordingly, a yajna/karma performed creates a
mental impression in Ishvara, who then bestows the doer of the karma with
the appropriate result. It should be clear that we are talking about
Ishvara as the giver of results of karma, and also witnessing the actions
of all. Hence, there is no need to speculate otherwise.
