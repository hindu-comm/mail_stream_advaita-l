You say: >> It is not extended by Sri Bhagavatpada  to say
that Ishvara indeed is  ** impressed ** by the same.
>>
and
>>
There is nothing like ** Ishvara’s
samskAra ** intended by Sri Bhagavatpada. >>

I think you are nitpicking without getting the gist, us usual. What I said
is reproduced here:

"Just as service rendered to a master by a servant creates an impression in
the  mind of the master, who then rewards the servant accordingly, a
yajna/karma performed creates a mental impression in Ishvara, who then
bestows the doer of the karma with the appropriate result."

This is not my imagination but based on the following statement from the
Kena vAkyabhAShya:
सेव्यबुद्धिवत्सेवकेन सर्वज्ञेश्वरबुद्धौ तु संस्कृतायां यागादिकर्मणा
विनष्टेऽपि कर्मणि सेव्यादिवेश्वरात्फलं कर्तुर्भवतीति युक्तम् ।  Note the
words used here are सर्वज्ञेश्वरबुद्धौ and संस्कृतायां. There is nothing
wrong in saying the yajna/karma creates an impression in the mind of
Ishvara. By the word "impression" is meant a mental seed-like construct
(saMskAra), not necessarily good or bad. Whatever the impression is, there
will be a fruit according to that impression.

So I urge everyone concerned to read the Kena-vAkyabhAShya on 3-12 in its
entirety before jumping to conclusions.

Anand
