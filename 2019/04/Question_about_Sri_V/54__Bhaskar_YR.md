if they differ, what is the subtle difference, pls explain.

praNAms Sri Kameshwara Rao prabhuji

Prior to jnana jnAniâ€™s personal belongings can easily be acceptable to  both jnAni and ajnAni whereas post jnana period jnAni realizes his own svarUpa is brahman / Atman and ashareeratvaM is his svabhAvika dharma.  (a) is pre jnana period and (b) is post jnana period ðŸ˜Š  Hope you would understand what I am trying to say here.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Dear Bhaskar Ji,
                           The discussions are going so nicely as people are putting deeper thoughts in knowing the self.


Quote  "When a new sharIra is takenup due to prArabdha, it is along with samskAras/vAsanAs. This has been stated elsewhere in the vArtika. I am unable to give exact reference offhand ".

I need reference for this and which vArtika it was stated?? pls provide


There is no difference here.

I reckon there is subtle ( but the significant one) difference in saying
(a) prArabdha carries vAsana & saMskAra in jnAni's BMI will last till the death of physical body and
(b) due to prArabda and avidyA lesha there would be a chances of getting 'fresh' vAsana / saMskAra in the form of rAga-dvesha during the post realization period.
I will say both a &b are same, may different paths reaching the same destination

if they differ, what is the subtle difference, pls explain.


Sri Guru Padaravindarpana Mastu
