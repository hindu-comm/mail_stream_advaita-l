You write  << Thus prarabdha, when it begins its work, is not without inducing the appropriate samskara/vasana in the person >>.

 This is exactly what I also meant in my earlier post.

Quote  <<  When a new sharIra is takenup due to prArabdha, it is along with samskAras/vAsanAs. This has been stated elsewhere in the vArtika. I am unable to give exact reference offhand >>.

There is no difference here.

I reckon there is subtle ( but the significant one) difference in saying 
(a) prArabdha carries vAsana & saMskAra in jnAni's BMI will last till the death of physical body and  
(b) due to prArabda and avidyA lesha there would be a chances of getting 'fresh' vAsana / saMskAra in the form of rAga-dvesha during the post realization period.  

If I mis-read these two different positions my apologies in advance.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
