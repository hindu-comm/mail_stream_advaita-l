Then my question is that : How no new innate tendenciessanskaras settle in the physical body? so that it will lead to moksha.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

To get this punarjanma rahita mOksha, jnAni has to realize that he is ashareeri only as a result completely free from katrutva-bhOktrutva.  The final pramANa indeed removes the very knowership of Atman says bhagavapAda in Geeta bhAshya.  Thinking oneself as dehavAn (sashareeri) itself avidyA (dehAtma buddhi).  The paramArtha jnAni does not have this type of avidyA hence for him no more birth nor death.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
