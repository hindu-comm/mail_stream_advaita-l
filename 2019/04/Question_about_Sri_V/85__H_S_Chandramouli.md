Undoubtedly,  as suggested, the Kena text should be read. The question is ,
by whom?.

Does the Bhashya mean that Ishvara is  ** impressed  ** by the yajna/karma
performed by a doer?? I don’t think so. Just as in the illustration, a
servant does a job to impress the master who in turn is impressed, even so
a doer performs a yajna/karma  thinking that he will impress Ishvara who
 then, having been  **impressed**, will bestow favours on him. The scope of
the illustration ends there. It is not extended by Sri Bhagavatpada  to say
that Ishvara indeed is  ** impressed ** by the same. Ishvara is
specifically  stated to be a  **sAkshi** for the yajna/karma. SAkshi is not
one who is  **impressed**. He is nirvikAri. As per mImAmsakAs, the karma
itself bestows the intended benefits to the doer via the generation of
apUrva. As per advaita sidhAnta, karma or karmaphala does not by itself
bestow the benefits because it is inert, but the benefits of the karmaphala
are bestowed  on the doer through an ** Intelligent ** entity, namely
Ishvara. In fact in the Kena context, this is presented as shruti pramANa
for  ** Existence ** of Ishvara.  There is nothing like ** Ishvara’s
 samskAra ** intended by Sri Bhagavatpada.  Ishvara  as a sAkshi /
antaryAmi ( Kena bhashya cites the relevant shruti vAkya in this regard )
ensures that the benefits of the yajna/karma indeed are made available to
the doer at the appropriate time.

Then the question arises where is this info stored till fruition?.That is
the question I had addressed.

 Reg << Hence, there is no need to speculate otherwise >>,

Needless speculation??  Well  it is your prerogative to judge.  If it helps
anyone else, purpose is served.
