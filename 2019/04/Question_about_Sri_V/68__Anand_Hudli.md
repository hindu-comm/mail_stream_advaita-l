Then you have to admit at least such existence of prArabdha is outside the
scope of avidya kalpita jagat. Otherwise it also should have destroyed when
jnAna is realized.  This leads to advaita hAni. All arguments using arrow
(already left from the bow) or inertia of potter's wheel, are all useless
as the causes of such things are not related to each other.

No use arguing with you. This has been my experience in the past. The
problem is that you seem to be neither a sincere seeker of advaita
information, nor a well read dvaitin. So I am not interested in arguing
with you. This will be my last message to you in this forum. Any further
objections from you will go unanswered by me.

My answer to the objection above: No, there is no advaitahAni. All
discussion of jIvanmukti is at the vyAvahArika level, since in reality,
there is no seeker, no bondage, and no liberation. Since we are talking now
at the vyAvahArika level, there will be duality, i.e. avidyA, avidyAlesha,
prArabdha, etc. Nothing wrong here.
