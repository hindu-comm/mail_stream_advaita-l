Thanks for the clarification. We have in the Panchadashi Chapter 6, the
above analogy, in the same context:

तादात्म्याध्यास एवात्र पूर्वोक्ताविद्यया कृतः ।
अविद्यायां निवृत्तायां तत्कार्यं विनिवर्तते ॥ ५२॥

अविद्यावृतितादात्म्ये विद्ययैव विनश्यतः ।
विक्षेपस्य स्वरूपं तु प्रारब्धक्षयमीक्ष्यते ॥ ५३॥

उपादाने विनष्टेऽपि क्षणं कार्यं प्रतीक्ष्यते ।
इत्याहुस्तार्किकास्तद्वदस्माकं किं न सम्भवेत् ॥ ५४॥

तन्तूनां दिनसंख्यानां तैस्तादृक्क्षण ईरितः ।

भ्रमस्यासंख्यकल्पस्य योग्यः क्षण इहेष्यताम् ॥ ५५॥


I think the Ratnaprabha gloss on the Brahma sutra bhashya has said that
samskara is also referred as avidyalesha.
