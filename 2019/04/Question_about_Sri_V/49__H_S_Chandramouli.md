Namaste Sri Subrahmanian Ji,

 A small difference in my understanding. Prarabdha is different from
samskAra/vAsanas. When a new sharIra is takenup due to prArabdha, it is
along with samskAras/vAsanAs. This has been stated elsewhere in the
vArtika. I am unable to give exact reference offhand. SharIra lasts as long
as dictated by prArabdha. SamskArAs/vAsanAs continue during this period but
as modified due to sAdhanAs undertaken in the current birth prior to jnAna.
But they can be overcome through sAdhanAs post jnAna also. This is what is
undertaken in vidvat sanyAsa post attainment of jnAna. And can lead to
jIvanmukti. All the same, even without such specific sAdhanAs or vidvat
sanyAsa, the jnAni is assured of escape rom rebirth after the current
sharIra is givenup.

Regards
