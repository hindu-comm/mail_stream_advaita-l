This is really a good question. Can MS just debate with dvaitins without really based on siddhAnta of Advaita? If yes, then all advaitin should drop the notion and pride that Advaitasidhhi has refuted Nyayamrita and rescued Advaita.

Very smart way of twisting the statement ðŸ˜Š I only said, if Sri MS said like that just to debate with dvaitins, then he might not be following what shankara said.  It does not mean he is not following Advaita. At the best you can claim he is not following methodology as presented by shankara.  If Sri MSâ€™s methodology ( prakriya ) is more than enough to refute the objections of dvaitins, the purpose is already served ðŸ˜Š   Sri Jay prabhuji used to say in vAdAvaLi, you bring anything in the name of â€˜advaitaâ€™ invariably  I will show you how it is wrong.  Likewise, I would like to say, bring any objection in the name of dvaita, any prakriya in Advaita would good enough to refute its objection and establish Advaita siddhAnta ðŸ˜Š

You know, we, the advaitins, may have many internal debates, but when it comes to its defense in front of other schools of thought (especially dvaitins ) we are all ONE and the SAME, ofcourse you know ultimately we are, the advaitins, all  Atmaikatva vAdins and donâ€™t allow others to intrude and divide us ðŸ˜Š

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

If this is what Sri MS is saying not just to debate with dvaitins but presenting it as ultimate siddhAnta of Advaita, then I could understand  why there is a statement that says Sri MS is not completely following Sri bhagavatpAda and differs from him in some aspects of Advaita.
