"Just as service rendered to a master by a servant creates an impression in the  mind of the master, who then rewards the servant accordingly, a yajna/karma performed creates a mental impression in Ishvara, who then bestows the doer of the karma with the appropriate result."

This is not my imagination but based on the following statement from the Kena vAkyabhAShya:
सेव्यबुद्धिवत्सेवकेन सर्वज्ञेश्वरबुद्धौ तु संस्कृतायां यागादिकर्मणा विनष्टेऽपि कर्मणि सेव्यादिवेश्वरात्फलं कर्तुर्भवतीति युक्तम् ।  Note the words used here are सर्वज्ञेश्वरबुद्धौ and संस्कृतायां. There is nothing wrong in saying the yajna/karma creates an impression in the mind of Ishvara. By the word "impression" is meant a mental seed-like construct (saMskAra), not necessarily good or bad. Whatever the impression is, there will be a fruit according to that impression.

>  Frankly I donot know what exactly is the problem in accepting Ishwara is karma phala dAta.  When Ishwara is upAsya brahma, he has the upAdhi vishesha so, accordingly phala also differs says bhAshyakAra.  We should get confused Ishwara here in this context as nirvikAri parabrahma, it is upAsya brahma who can be propitiated through yagna, dhyAna, upAsana etc.  He is the bestower of karma phala to jeeva-s.  He has the power of srushti which jeeva-s donot have.  He is the jagat kAraNa, he is bhArUpa, manOmaya, he can even instruct some of the mukta jeeva-s to reincarnate to do dharma prachAra.  He is the controller of both karma phala and jnana phala, madadheenaM karmiNAM karma phalaM, jnAninAM cha jnana phalaM says bhagavAn in Geeta.  The question is are we good enough to demand that brahman is nirvikAri and he has to be always like that when we ourselves 'vikAri' due to our identification with upAdhi??  I don’t think so.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
