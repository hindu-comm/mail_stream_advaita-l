Sri Sureswaracharya, in his vArtika BUBV 1-4-1529 (and other verses around)
(TIka of Sri Anandagiri AchArya also refers)  observes that the locus for
prArabdha and associated samskAra/vAsanAs etc  is the sharIra which is the
product of prArabdha.The locus for sanchita and AgAmi karmas is avidya.
Hence on attaining jnAna, when avidya  located in Brahman is destroyed,
these  sanchita and AgAmi karmas located in avidya are destroyed, but not
the prArabdha and associated samskAras and vAsanas which are located in the
sharIra. But the continuance of these are no hindrance to the jnani .

Only one most relevant verse from this portion of the vArtika is copied
here for ready reference

<< आरब्धफलशेषैकहेतुत्वाद्देहसंस्थितेः ॥

रागादिप्रत्ययोद्भूतिरिषुचक्रादिवेगवत् ॥ >>

<< ArabdhaphalasheShaikahetutvAddehasaMsthiteH ||

rAgAdipratyayodbhUtiriShuchakrAdivegavat || >>.

The corresponding Bhashya portion , BUB 1-4-10

 << यत्तूक्तं विपरीतप्रत्ययतत्कार्ययोश्च दर्शनादिति, न,
तच्छेषस्थितिहेतुत्वात् — येन कर्मणा शरीरमारब्धं तत् ,
