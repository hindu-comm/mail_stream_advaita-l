Namaste Bhaskarji

You wrote something interesting...
I reckon there is subtle ( but the significant one) difference in saying
(a) prArabdha carries vAsana & saMskAra in jnAni's BMI will last till the
death of physical body and
(b) due to prArabda and avidyA lesha there would be a chances of getting
'fresh' vAsana / saMskAra in the form of rAga-dvesha during the post
realization period.

Are you saying that you misread the traditional position until now to be
what is titled (b)  ?

Om
