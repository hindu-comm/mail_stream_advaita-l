Your view, holds that negation of the jagat as contemplated by "mithyAtva"
is from pAramarhika point-of-view, or officially what is coined
as "pAramArthikatvAkAreNa niShEdhaH".  This view is held by some old
advaitins and many neo-vEdAntins.

Sri.Vyasa Tirtha refutes this position in His nyAyAmruta on the grounds of
anyOnyAshrya involved. pAramArthikatva, as defined, is
marked by characteristic of uncontradictedness  or abAdhyatvam. It is only
when one has proper understanding of pAramArthatvam as not
liable to contradiction, can one will understand the concept of
"mithyAtvam" as bAdhyatvam.  On the other hand,  unless when one has
prior understanding of mithyatva as something subjected to negation or
liquidation, one can not able to understand pAramArthikatvam as
something which is not being subjected to contradiction.

Madhusudhana recognizes and accepts this anyOnyAshrya dOSha as pointed out
by nyAmritakAra, and thus argues for svarUpENaiva niShEdha doctrine for
this mithya jagat. Please see my earlier quote on this. If so, the very
prArabdha-karma being so part and parcel of this vyavahAra jagat, cannot be
said to still exist even after jnyAna realization.

If you try to avoid advaitahAni dOSha you will end up with anyOnyAshrya
dOSha in your position. Back to square one!
