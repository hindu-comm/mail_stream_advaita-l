Namaste Bhaskar Ji,

Sorry for the delayed response. My Net connection was down.

I think we have discussed this topic as between us too many times. No point
in going over the same discussions over and over again. When posts by other
members on the topic call for a response, let us do so separately and put
forth our respective views as deemed fit. It is upto them to take a view.
We can avoid discussions as between us.

Regards
