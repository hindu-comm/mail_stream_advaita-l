Nice equations. More equations

Jeeva = Brahman + Alpajnatva Adi Upadhis
Ishwara = Brahman + Sarvjanatva Adi Upadhis
Jeeva - Upadhis = Brahman
Ishwara - Upadhis = Brahman
Therefore Jeeva - Upadhis = Ishwara - Upadhis = Brahman
This is the great Mahavakya Tat Tvam Asi saying. Jeeva has to realize this.
Jagat = Brahman + Adhyasta Avidya and its Karyas
Jagat - Avidya = Brahman
But Jagat cannot realize this. It is not a Chetana Vastu like Jeeva to
realize this.
This is the difference. The Jeeva can realize he is Brahman. But Jagat
cannot realize itself is Brahman. Jeeva can realize Avidya Kalpita Jagat is
Mithya. Jagat cannot realize the Avidya Kalpita Upadhis of Jeeva are
Mithya. Therefore both Jeeva and Jagat cannot be similar. One is realizing
as Brahman. The other is not realizing anything.
