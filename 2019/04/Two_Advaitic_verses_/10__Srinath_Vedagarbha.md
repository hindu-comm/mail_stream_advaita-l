You are confusing between actual kAraNa and the potentiality (a guNa) of
being kAraNa. mRt may or may not have been already a kAraNa for a ghaTa,
but you cannot deny its guNa of being one (anytime in future). Your example
of ghaTa and its material kAraNa mRt is invalid.

How do you deny guNa in Brahman? Unless you say this jagat is adhyArOpa on
Brhamn (hence mithya) you cannot deny guNa in Brahman. On the other hand,
unless you start with Brhamn being nirguNa, you cannot hold jagat is
mithya. Which comes first? That is the interdependence we are talking here.

If you say there is no anyonyAshraya , remember you are going against MS's
own acceptance and causing your own dOSha of apasiddhAnta !

Where did I say MS other dOSha is refuted? I did not even touch Tarangini.
I just quoted svarUpENa-niShEda in context of other member's conversation.

Then, please tell me how do you distinguish Brahman from vandyAputra?  Your
assumption that  visheShaNa is need only between sajAtIya vastus, quite
baseless assumtion.

Glad you mentioned Tai. Up.  This is not useful for you here. Do not forget
"satyaM" is interpreted as not as sat directly but as "not-asat". Do not
forget Brahman in your school is na-iti na-iti, which definitely includes
your characterization of Brhaman as as "sadbrhamn". Another instance of
apasiddhAnta?
