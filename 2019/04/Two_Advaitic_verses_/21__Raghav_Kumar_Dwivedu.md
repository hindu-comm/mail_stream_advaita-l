When the word rajata is used to
refer to 'a precious metal', then, most certainly svarUpeNaiva niShedhah of
rajata is *necessary* for correct knowledge of shukti which is it's
adhiSThAnam


It is the other way around in fact.  According to siddhAnta, it is
knowledge of the substratum which leads to the sublation of the
superimposed object. So it is the iyam shukti jnAna which is the cause of
the bAdha (svarUpeNa niShedha) of rajata. But yes, it is the svarUpa
niShedha of rajata that occurs.

Yes certainly. Please read my words as "svarUpeNaiva niShedhah of
rajata *necessarily occurs* with correct knowledge of shukti which is it's
adhiSThAnam. Thanks for pointing it out.

Om
Raghav
