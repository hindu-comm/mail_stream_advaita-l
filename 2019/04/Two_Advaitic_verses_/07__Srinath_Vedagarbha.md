How can it be? When you negate rajata, you are negating very svarUpa of
rajata, meaning the material silver is negated along with all its rUpa.

Thank you for agreeing svarUpa of this jagat = Brahman. When MS denies the
very svarUpa of this jagat, it is equivalent to denying Brahman.

Again, when you negate very svarUpa of rajata, you are negating material
existence of silver along with all its nature (such as shining-ness etc.) .
You cannot say only nature is changing but existence does not change.
Remember the 'sva' in the term svarUpa indicates which is self-same nature.
If you hold svarUpa can change without existence not necessarily being
changed,  then you are diluting the notion of 'sva'.

Unless you hold brahman is nirguNa you cannot say kAraNatva of brahman is
also mithyA. Unless you negate this jagat (by negating kAraNatva of brahman
and its kArya jagat) you cannot say Brahman is nirguNa. That is the very
issue of anyOnyAshrya pointed out in nyayAmrita my friend.

In that case your Brahman is sadrUpa-brahman. Do not call nirviShESha
brahman. Doesn't sadrUpa is also a viShEShaNa?
