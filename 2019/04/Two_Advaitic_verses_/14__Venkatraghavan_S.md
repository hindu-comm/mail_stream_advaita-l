Namaste,

What you have quoted is not relevant to what Bhaskar ji is saying. He is
saying that the world's svarUpa as Brahman is never negated, whereas you
are quoting a passage from the Advaita Siddhi which is saying that the
nature of negation of the world is absolute.

There is a difference between the two. When the shell silver is absolutely
denied, it does not mean that the substance that is the basis for the shell
silver - the shell - is denied. It means that the existence of the shell
silver is totally denied. The avadhi, what remains, after the pAramArthika
niShedha of jagat is Brahman.

Similarly when the world's existence is totally denied, it does not mean
that the substance that is the basis for the world - Brahman - is denied. The
avadhi, what remains, after the pAramArthika niShedha of shukti rajata is
the shukti.

Thus Bhaskar ji's concern for the svarUpa of the world as Brahman is well
preserved even after the pAramArthika niShedha mentioned in the Advaita
Siddhi.

Regards
Venkatraghavan
