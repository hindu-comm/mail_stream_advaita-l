No, pls read shuktirUpeNa angikArAt, else you, not an advaitin, are a
shUnyavAdi as you will say that now the rajata is gone and so, shukti is
also not there. Else, if you say rajata is really rajata, I will give you
lot of shukti and you can give me rajata back. :-)

I wonder if you feel that I wrote something more complicated than MS! I
didn't say that at all as you can see in the next sentence itself.
Everywhere you see the word svarUpa, you can't have the same meaning.

Again, I too will give you shukti as material cause, can you give me rajata?

This is very well covered under nAsato vidyate bhAvaH nAbhAvo vidyate sataH
by Bhagavan Bhashyakara घटे विनष्टे घटबुद्दौ व्यभिचरन्त्यां सद्बुद्धिरपि
व्यभिचरतीति चेत् , न ; पटादावपि सद्बुद्धिदर्शनात्।

Not so, already answered with the example of nAmarUpAtmakaM jagat. AtmA=
svarUpa = nAmarUpa =/= (not equal to) existence.

Not at all. I can say that kAryajagat is mithyA, then since kArya is
mithyA, what are you holding onto kAraNatva for?! If there is no kArya
itself, kAraNatva is mithyA is obvious. You cannot say that there is no
ghaTa, but mRt is its kAraNa and hold on to kAraNatva for mRt! mRt remains
without the guNa of being the ghaTakAraNa. Ergo, such guNa being refuted
for brahman, brahman remains nirguNa. There is clearly no anyonyAshraya
here. In any case, anyonyAshraya has been refuted by MS with your own
acceptance by saying MS avoids it by talking of svarUpa instead. You have
also quoted MS yourself to say that the other doSha also stands refuted.

I don't want to use your rUpa here, else you will imagine more doShas
thinking that I accept whatever rUpa means for you; lets agree that its
sadbrahman. We will call it exactly nirvisheSha, nirguNa, as per Shruti.
Now sattA is guNa for you as a visheShaNa not for an advaitin...

> Doesn't sadrUpa is also a viShEShaNa?

No no, sat is lakShaNA. This kind of visheShaNa you think it is, is needed
only when separating one from other. We don't have any notion of additional
brahman or any thing other than brahman, so we don't need any vyAvartaka.
Anywhere there is sat, that sat is brahma alone. For you, if jagat is sat,
we will take away sat from it as it is brahman and then you will be left
with jagat which you can no longer call sat as it is only nAmarUpa then and
therefore mithyA. Refer bhAShya under Tai. Up. mantra satyaM jnAnamanantam
brahma. All this pUrvapakSha is not new to Advaitin, Bhagavan Bhashyakara
has already refuted it.
