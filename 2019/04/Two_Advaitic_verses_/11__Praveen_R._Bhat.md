Since you know you can make ghaTa out of mRt, you are free to make this
argument of potential guNa, whatever it means, but I'm saying that brahman
has no guNa because it was never, is not and will never be a kAraNa for
anything. Where is the potentiality?! If you insist it's there, I'll say
that is mithyA too. Now you may want to think of how did you get to know of
ghaTakAraNatva of mRt without ghaTa itself.

Shruti does.

Unless you say this jagat is adhyArOpa on Brhamn (hence mithya) you cannot

Already explained so.

On the other hand, unless you start with Brhamn being nirguNa, you cannot

You can start from any end and establish the other. The issue with shushka
tarka is you want to start with both together!

Which comes first?

As above. Take any.

That is the interdependence we are talking here.

The interdependence is resolved by taking refuge in Shruti.

That's your opinion. It's not even close though. There are more ways to
solve an issue. I don't see MS accept such doSha in as many words in any
case. It's your assuming that it is the reason he takes a particular route.
Even so, you yourself have to accept  both that he agreed that there can be
such a doSha and resolved it. You can't just agree with half of what MS
said and not with the resolution, any which way.

I don't need to since vandhyAputra is non-existent.

This argument of yours itself is baseless. Pls refer what visheshaNa means
in kalpadruma, etc, and then revisit lakShaNa, assuming you've studied
vyAkaraNa well. Else you may be a special case of someone who may be using
words such as nilotpala to distinguish from another such as raktaghaTa!

That's only partial understanding, worse than no understanding, of course.
Don't handpick bhAShya sentences, take that bhAshya whole.

Pls tell me what is your understanding of Advaitin's understanding of what
is iti here. I can clearly see that you don't have the slightest idea. This
is the issue of trying to jump to brihatprashthAna without prashthAnatraya,
be it as apUrvapakShi!

Another instance of apasiddhAnta?

Perhaps for yourself, yet another. As for me, you don't know enough of
siddhAnta to call out apasiddhAnta.
