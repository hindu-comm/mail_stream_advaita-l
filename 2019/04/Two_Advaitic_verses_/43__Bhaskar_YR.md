Finally, yes, both kAraNatva and kArya kAraNa ananyatva are spoken of only from a vyAvahArika viewpoint.

brahmaivedaM vishwaM says mundaka, sarvaM cha nAma rUpAdi sadAtmanaiva satyaM, to know this truth one should have bhUma vidya.  And that jnana would reside only in the brahma jnAni and he could only say this nAma rUpa jagat is sadAtmanaiva satyaM and what we are seeing as jagat is brahmameva.  How this kArya-KaraNa saMbandha appears to brahma vAdins??  He has the relationship with tAdAtmya lakshaNa...kArya-kAraNa sambandhaH brahmavAdinaH kathaM iti chet??  Tasya tAdAtmyalakshaNasambandhOpapatteH clarifies bhAshyakAra in sUtra bhAshya.  Now the question, is this brahma vAdi saying this only from the vyAvahArika drushti or Atmaikatva paramArtha drushti??  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
