Namaste,
Apologies about having to resend this, but I noticed that all the
formatting was lost in the previous email, so I am appending the identity
of the speaker for each statement here.

Srinath:

We are not talking of niShedha of the niShedha here. When you do the
niShedha of this jagat, you may do another niShedha of this
"jagat-niShedha" itself no problem, but from where that outer niShedha
made? It can't be from vyavahAra as you agreed it will be negated. So, it
has to be from pAramArtha only as I am saying.


Venkatraghavan:
It does not have to be pAramArthika. That is the argument being made - even
if the niShedha is prAtibhAsika like a dream negation of a dream object, it
can still do a bAdha. What remains after the niShedha is pAramArthika
advaita, because the niShedha negates all dvaita, including itself.

Srinath:

It is not correct. When the pot is destroyed, its pradhvamAbhAva is
affirmed. Your example is based on wrong argument because atyantAbhAva  is
negated in both the cases -- when pot was there and when pot was destroyed.
There is no specialty to be used as hEtu in instances of pot destruction.
Such usage suffers from ativyApti flaw.


Venkatraghavan:
That is why two examples were given. The first example is to show that with
the same niShedhyatA avacChedaka dharma it is possible to negate every
non-elephant attribute. The second example is to show that the niShedha
does not have to be only of bhAva rUpa padArtha alone, even abhAva padArtha
can be negated. Now, you seem to think that atyantAbhAva is negated when
the pratiyogi is present. That is not correct.

In nyAya, it is very much possible to say that a pot and its atyantAbhAva
are present in the same locus. In the cognition "the pot is on the ground",
bhUtale ghaTa:, the naiyyAyika will argue that bhUtale samavAya sambandhena
ghaTasya atyAntAbhava: asti - the atyantAbhAva of the pot with a samavAya
sambandha with the ground is present. Now, both the pot and pot
atyantAbhAva exist in the same locus. When ghaTa dhvamsa occurs, it is
possible for me to argue that the very dhvamsa is the hetu for the niShedha
for both the pot and its atyantAbhAva.

Srinath:

But that outer negation (negation of dream objects) has to be other
(higher) state than the state itself being subject of negation. I am saying
the same, negation of objects seen in  vyavahArika  and negation of
vyavahArika itself is only from (higher) state of pAramArthika. MS's
arguments are no arguments.

Venkatraghavan:
The last statement is uncalled for and rude. Anyway, ignoring that, there
is no rule that says that the niShedha of niShedha requires that the outer
one, as you call it, has to have a higher order of reality than the second.
The sublatability of the outer negation has no bearing on its sublation of
the former. A rope can be mistaken for a snake. If there is a subsequent
illusion that it is a crack in the ground, that can still negate the snake
illusion. However, both the crack in the ground and the snake are equally
illusory.

One may argue that such a negation is not bAdha, or Atyantika nivRtti. For
a jnAna to qualify as bAdhaka jnAna, it must be a vyAvrittAkAra jnAna
revealing the adhiShThAna of the bhrama. Brahman is the adhiShThAna of
everything - including both the jagat and brahma jnAna, thus by that one
brahma jnAna, both the jagat and brahmajnAna itself are sublated.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
