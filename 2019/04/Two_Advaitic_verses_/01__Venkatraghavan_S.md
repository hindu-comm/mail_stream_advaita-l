Namaste Raghav ji,

One difference between the two statements is that the former is aikya
sAmAnAdhikaraNya, whereas the latter is bAdha sAmAnAdhikaraNya. In both
cases, there is only one entity after the sAmAnAdhikaraNya - Brahman - but
the sAmAnAdhikaraNya involved is different. The former is identity, the
latter is sublation.

If the intended meaning of the sentences are slightly different from the
above, one can say that the former statement is one of identity, whereas
the latter statement is one of non-difference. There is a difference
between the two - only one entity is possible for identity, whereas two
entities are involved in the non-difference in question. To explain:

The first statement is of identity  - the jIva is absolutely identical with
Brahman. As a relationship requires two entities, there can be no
relationship between jIva and Brahman. This is like saying A=A.

The second statement is of non-difference. The world is non-different from
its cause, Brahman. The relationship is one of AdhyAsika tAdAtmya - the
existence that is Brahman, is superimposed onto the world, and vice versa -
the world is superimposed upon Brahman. This is like saying A=B. A and B
are two entities which are being equated in one respect.

As Madhusudana Sarasvati argues in the advaita siddhi - अभेदे
कार्यकारणभावव्याहत्या कथंचिदपि भेदस्यावश्याभ्युपेयत्वात् | नच
'तदनन्यत्वमारम्भणशब्दादिभ्य' इत्यधिकरणविरोध: ; उपादानव्यतिरेकेनोपदेयं
नास्तीत्यस्यैव तदर्थत्वात् | - As identity would mean that the very notion
of cause and effect is contradicted, some difference between the two must
necessarily be accepted (when speaking of the non-difference of the effect
from the cause). Nor does it contradict the section "There is
non-difference, on account of texts that speak of origin etc" (from the
brahma sUtra), for the meaning of that section is only to teach that the
effect is non-existent apart from / in the absence of the cause.

Thus ananyatvam does not mean identity, it means the non-existence of the
effect independent of the cause (mithyAtva).

Finally, yes, both kAraNatva and kArya kAraNa ananyatva are spoken of only
from a vyAvahArika viewpoint.

Kind regards,
Venkatraghavan
