Hope you will excuse me for intruding. Whenever jIva is stated as Brahman
alone, reference is to the Consciousness/Sentience/Intelligence  aspect.
Jiva is Brahman is an advaitic declaration (pratignya).  You are no doubt
aware that practically all nonadvaitic schools consider sentient entities
to be infinite in number. It is only advaita sidhanta which holds that  “
Sentient “ entity is only one. And that is Brahman.

Jagat refers to the nonsentient entities in Creation. It is never stated as
Brahman. It is always referred to as mithya. In those contexts where jIva
specifically includes the BMI, then jIva is also considered as mithya.

Pardon the intrusion.

 Regards
