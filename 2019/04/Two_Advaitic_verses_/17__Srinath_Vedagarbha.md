I do not think so. Please re-read Sri.Bhaskar-ji's mail. Let me quote here
again for the clarity;

I am sorry, I donâ€™t think so. ' Jagat never stated as braman'  is really a
sweeping statement which denies the very existence of jagat in its
svarUpa.  When Shruti categorically declaring brahmaivedaM amrutaM
purastAt, idaM sarvaM yadayamAtmA, sarvaM khalvidaM brahma, yenAshrutaM
shrutaM bhavatyamataM mataM avijnAtaM vijnAtaM, brahman is left, right,
top, bottom etc. etc., I am afraid conclusions like this especially when
jagat is accessible to both jnAni and ajnAni in samAna rUpa through
pratyakshAdi prAmaNa, would bring the Shruti hAni.  IMHO, jagat in its
svarUpa never ever been negated as  it is pariNAmi nitya and trishu kAleshu
one with brahman.  And as per the popular trend, even for the jnAni is
jagat would continue to exist and it is because of this only due to
prArabdha his BMI (vAng, manaH, kAya) would continue to engage in
pravrutti.  samyakjnAnAprAptAvapi avashyaM bhAvinI pravruttiH vAngmanaH
kAyAnAM.  When there is an admission of existence of BMI how can we deny
the existence of jagat, is this upAdhi of jnAni not paNchabhUtAtmaka ??

If you notice it is been said that -- jagat  in its ***svarUpa*** (a key
word) never ever been negated as  it is pariNAmi nitya and trishu kAleshu
***one with brahman*** (another keyword). The text does not indicate
adhisTAna  is meant  for svarUpa as you are defending now. Even if we
assume he meant so (that svarUpa=adhisTAna), I am fair in my own stand that
since MS distinguishes between those two terms (svarUpa vs
adhisTAna)(otherwise why he is doing niShEda?)  I took Sri.Bhaskara-ji also
meant the same.

On the philosophical note -- why svarUpa is equated with adhisTAna in the
school?  To the question what is the svarUpa of silver in the illusion? If
you deny reality to it, then you are denying reality to adhisTAna shell. On
the other hand, if you assert  reality for the svarUpa of silver (just
because you want to preserve reality to adhisTAna shell), you are asserting
reality to silver as it is presented.
