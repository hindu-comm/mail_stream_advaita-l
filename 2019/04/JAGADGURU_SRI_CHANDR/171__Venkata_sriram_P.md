Namaste,

........................................................................

1) O Child, if you have the desire to cross
the ocean of transmigratory existence, listen to
what I am saying. It is in consonance with the
Upanishads and would be helpful to you later. 

2) Have your head shaven. Throw away your
sacred thread donned for performing sacrifices.
Become a sannyasi. Be a steadfast
adherent of sadhana chatustaya.

...............................................................

Though directed towards Shri.Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal,
I see that it is aptly put here when discussion on 'sanyAsa' is underway.

rgs,
sriram
