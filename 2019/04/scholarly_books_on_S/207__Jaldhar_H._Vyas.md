Some recent scholarship has updated some of the theories expressed in this 
book but it is still a good introduction in one volume.

I would recommend this one.  Volume 11 also covers Advaita Vedanta from 
800 AD - 1200 AD but at this point the controversies were mostly internal 
(i.e Bhamati vs Vivarana) or with other types of Vedanta rather than other 
darshanas.

A third volume will cover 1200AD - the present but I don't think it has 
been published yet.

The problem with Dasguptas work is simply that it is old and there has 
been more scholarship since then.  However it is still often cited by 
academics.


"The Essential Vedanta: A New Source Book of Advaita Vedanta" by Eliot 
Deutsch and Rohit Dalvi (2004, World Wisdom Inc.) is primarily as the name 
suggests a sourcebook of excerpts from Advaitic works of all phases of its 
history but it does also include interpretations of the historical and 
philosophical context.
