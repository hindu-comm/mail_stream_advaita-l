https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manasollasa

//The *Mānasollāsa*, also known as *Abhilashitartha Chintamani*, is an
early 12th-century Sanskrit text composed by the Kalyani Chalukya
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalyani_Chalukya_dynasty> king Someshvara III
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Someshvara_III>, who ruled in present-day South
India <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India>. It is an encyclopedic
work covering topics such as polity, governance, ethics, economics,
astronomy, astrology, rhetoric, veterinary medicine, horticulture,
perfumes, food, architecture, sports, painting, poetry and music. The text
is a valuable source of socio-cultural information on 11th- and
