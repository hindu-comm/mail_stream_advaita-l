Namaste,

om namaH caNDikAyai ||

Sadguru Shri Aniruddha Joshi (whom I follow), published the complete caritra of Adi mAtA in 2009.
The original publication was in Marathi. The same text is now available in English on Amazon as a
e-book.

https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07YG8L1VG/ref=rdr_kindle_ext_tmb

The text describes three manifestations ofAdi mAtA:
1. gAyatrI (Part-1 of text)
2. mahishasuramardini (Part-2 of text)
3. anasuyA (Part-3 of text)

The well known durgA saptashati is included in Part-2.

The presentation is in form of a dialogue between Shri parashurama and Shri dattatreya.
The terminology is somewhat different from what many people here may be used to.
There will also be sAmpradAya differences in view point - so take what you like, leave out
what does not appeal to you. I personally have been able to reconcile everything in there
with veda-s, bhAgavatam, gitA, upanishad-s.

Hari om.

Regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari
