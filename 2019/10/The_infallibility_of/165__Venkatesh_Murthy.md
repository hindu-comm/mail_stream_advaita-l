Namaste

Allasani Peddanna’s *Manucharitramu *says, “the Gods who have gotten over
the everyday problem of satiating hunger and thirst by drinking *Amruta*,
too, need enormous feasts to satisfy the craving of their taste buds.”

The residents of heaven have every facility available for satisfying every
sense organ. They are always enjoying something. Therefore it is very
difficult for them to think of Brahman and Vidya. That is why we hear
stories of Indra doing bad acts like going to Ahalya without being
satisfied with his own wife Sachi Devi.
