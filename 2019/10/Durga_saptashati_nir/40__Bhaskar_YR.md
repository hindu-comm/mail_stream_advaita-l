Sringeri publication too published the durgA saptashati with a small booklet with regard hOma vidhAna and anvAdAna, sumangali pooja, bali etc.  in Sanskrit.  Most of the South Indian priests would follow this.  And it has Kannada version as well. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Namaste
I have heard that the Nirnaya Sagar edition of the Durga Saptashati is well-edited and used in Homans etc, rather than the Gita press or other editions wherein the number of shlokas and their break-up tends to deviate from the traditional Chandi homam sequence.

I could get the online copy but wish to know if the Nirnaya Sagar edition of the Durga Saptashati is readily available as a hard copy.

Any information regarding this is appreciated.

Thank you
Om
Raghav
