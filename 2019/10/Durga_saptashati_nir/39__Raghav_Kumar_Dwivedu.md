Namaste
I have heard that the Nirnaya Sagar edition of the Durga Saptashati is
well-edited and used in Homans etc, rather than the Gita press or other
editions wherein the number of shlokas and their break-up tends to deviate
from the traditional Chandi homam sequence.

I could get the online copy but wish to know if the Nirnaya Sagar edition
of the Durga Saptashati is readily available as a hard copy.

Any information regarding this is appreciated.

Thank you
Om
Raghav
