Raam Raam
Sri Maha Periyava Charanam.

In South India there are different versions are followed.
I can't say about KA region, But regarding KL and TN region there are three
different prayoga vidhi I have come across.

1) Kumbakonam edition -> Published in long time back in the year 1930's in
grantha script. (Many Chandi upasakas from the Tanjore, Rameshvaram,
Kumbakonam and even few upasakas from Chennai follows this).
2) RS Vadhyar's Palghat edition -> Published in devanagari mostly available
in internet as well. (Many KL Chandi upasakas and most of the upasakas in
south of TN follows this)
3) Gita-Press Edition -> Published in devanagari available in internet as
well. (Most of the people follows this prayoga vidhi)

Thanks
C.R.Bala
Sri Guru Padha renu
