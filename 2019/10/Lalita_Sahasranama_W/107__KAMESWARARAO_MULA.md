Dear Members,
In Ashwin month Todays full moon day is celebrated as Sharad Purnima, which is also known as Kumara Purnima, Kojagiri Purnima, Navanna Purnima, or Kaumudi Purnima in different parts of India. The day marks a harvest festival, celebrating the end of the monsoon season. It is popularly believed that Sharad Purnima is the only day in the year when the moon comes out with all sixteen Kala(s). i.e 16 NITYAS of the Godess LALITA Maha Tripura Sundari.


Each human quality is associated with certain Kala and it is believed that the combination of sixteen different Kala(s) creates a perfect human personality. It is said that Lord Krishna was born with all sixteen Kala(s) and was the complete incarnation of Lord Vishnu. On the other hand, lord Rama was born with only twelve Kala(s)
Significance:It is believed that the Moon shines with all sixteen Kala(s). In addition, its rays have certain healing properties on the day, which nourish the body and the soul. The moon rays are said to drip nectar, therefore, people keep rice-kheer in the moonlight for the whole night. In the morning, the Rice-Kheer is distributed as Prasad in family members. RSS people does this activity with lot of exersizes, patrioitc stories towards the protection of Rashtra (mother land) and do very interesting sport inthe moon light which I witnessed a decade back at the University Campus.
In the Brij region, Sharad Purnima is also known as Raas Purnima, when Lord Krishna performed Maha-Raas, the dance of divine love.
In other parts of India, Lakshmi, the Hindu Goddess of Wealth as it is known as her birthday. It is said in certain Puranas that Goddess Lakshmi takes rounds of the earth to watch the actions of human beings during this night.


Saradpournima is the Brightest Porunimas of all the Full Moons
