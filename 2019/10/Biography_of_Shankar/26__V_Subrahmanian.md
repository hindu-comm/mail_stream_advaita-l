*Setu Foundation* is publishing on the auspicious day of Shankara Jayanti a
video series on his biography and teachings. Shri Swami Satchidanandendra
Saraswati of Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya has done yeoman service to
Shankaracharya and his philosophy. Based on his works Swami
Prakashanandendra Saraswati has tried to put together those parts of his
life which are acceptable to both Historians and Traditionalists. He has
also tried to sum up very important contributions of Shankaracharya in the
second part of the video. The plan is to make more videos which will shed
more light on Acharya and remove misconceptions about his life and
teachings.
