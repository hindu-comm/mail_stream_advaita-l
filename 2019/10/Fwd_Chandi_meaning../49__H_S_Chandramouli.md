Namaste.

I had no problem downloading the document. Thanks.

Swami Tapasyananda has translated Sri Lalia Sahasranama which can be
accessed at following link

<<
https://estudantedavedanta.net/Sri-Lalita%20Sahasranama-Ramakrishna-Mission.pdf
 >>

It has an Introduction by Prof DS Sharma. There is a comparison of Sri
Lalita Sahasranama with Durga Saptashati. It is very informative and
interesting. You may like to have a look, if not already done so.

Regards
