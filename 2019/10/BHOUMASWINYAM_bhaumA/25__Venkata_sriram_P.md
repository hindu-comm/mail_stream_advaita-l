Namaste,

While giving out the vedic mantra-s and bija-s, one should be careful enough 
to see whether wrong messages are being conveyed or not.  नीर-क्षीर न्यायः 
should be followed very meticulously. 

What is the use of copying & pasting the mantra-s , shaktha-siddhAnta 
from wikipedia & speaking tree.  

First of all, the information from those sources are not authentically presented 
with valid references and commentaries which is 
अशुद्ध  and and copying from those adds to another दोषः.  

BTW, सायणाचार्यः comments for अहम् राष्ट्रि as 'सर्वस्य जगदीश्वरी'.  

rgs,
sriram
