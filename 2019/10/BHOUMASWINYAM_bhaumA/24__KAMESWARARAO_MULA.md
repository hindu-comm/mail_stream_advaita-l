In which part of the veda it is from?? With a slightly different sentence we have the Rigveda devi sUkta or ambhruNi sUkta which we recite during chandi pArAyaNa : ahaM suve pitaramasya mUrdhanmama yOnirapsvaantaH Samudre and ahaM rAshtree saMgamani vasUnAm chikitushi PrathamA yajniyAnAM...I don’t know how to put swara-s here but since it is a veda mantra plain chanting not advisable and after learning the same from guru needs to be chanted with svara-s. 

Bhaskarji,        I thought to write this while posting this 'Bhoumasinyam' , I was in hurry and I thought it may be overlooked, but you catch the crux of the thing, Here is my explanation. I will try to answer in the way I want to, may be you can phrapharaise it latter. Yes you are right in the same swara which to be chanted as of the Devi-sukta of the Durga Sapta Sati. When ever there is mention of "RASHTRA" (in the form of welfare/kalyanam/protection) , theslouch's are derived from Atharvana Veda which is the heart of Mantra Sastra.https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/devi.html?lang=iast

How ever the DEVI UPANISHAD is derived from the both the Atharavan veda & Rigveda.It is one of the 19 Upanishads derived from theAtharva vedaand is classified as one of the eight ShaktaUpanishads. It is, as an Upanishad, a part of the corpus of Vedantaliterature collection also (Source: Wikipedia)The Upanishad states that the Mother Godessis the BRAHMAN(ultimate metaphysicalReality), and from her arise Prakṛti (matter) and Purusha (consciousness). She is bliss and non-bliss, the VEDASand what is different from it, the born and the unborn, and all of the universe.

The Devi Upanishad is part of the five Atharva Shiras Upanishads, each of which are named after the five main deities or shrines (panchayatanan) of Ganapathi , Vishnu, Ruda, Surya, mother godess. It is also menioned as Devi Aharvana Seersha.

Thencoming to the Rig vedic verses, any mother godess (praising/existance/worshipping chantings) are all derived from Rig veda only. So i think some of the rig vedicsloka arealsomentioned in the devi-upanishad just like atharvaseersha chanting, It should with the Anudatta/udatta swara only, then onlymeaning can bederived.
I tired to put my views, how ever, I would like to see your comments as well in this.
