Hari Om!Sadananda-----------------------Journey Beyond: A Non-Dual Approach
Everyone is searching for happinessthat is everlasting. Yet, none can find it by any pursuit; at the same time, none can stop the pursuit. This seems to be the tragedy of human life; nay thelife of every being. Every pursuit is limited: space-wise, time-wise andobject-wise. Any pursuit that is limited cannot give everlasting happiness.Some promise the eternal happiness after death, if one follows their path; yetnone has returned to claim that they accomplished it by following that path.One sage declares that ‘truth is a pathless land’. Vedanta ascertainsthat the truth is beyond the space-time-object wise limitations, andyou arethat truth – tat tvam asi. The ‘Journey Beyond’ space-time limitations isthe central theme of the discussions in this text.
