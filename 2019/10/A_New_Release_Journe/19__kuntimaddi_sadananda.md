Kameswararao - PraNAms
There is a famous statement by a swami.'When the seeker and the sought are one and the same, any seeking on the part of the seeker is bound to fail since in the very seeking the seeker has concluded that sought is not there where the seeker is' .The happiness that is being referred to is the ever lasting eternal happiness that one longs for as the very goal in life - the very fulfillment of the purpose of life itself. Please remember the Aanda scale discussed in the Tai. Up. One is 100 times more happy than the fellow down in the Ananda scale. The highest ananda is Brahmaji who is 10 power of 26 times the ananda of a human being how owns the whole world. Even his ananda is finite and not infinite.

 Dear Dr. Sadananda Garu,
                        Thank you for the information and web link & I will get that book , go through it and debate with you for any apprehensions/doubts in the concepts for the Journey beyond: A non-dual approach.

"Everyone is searching for happiness that is everlasting. Yet, none can find it by any pursuit; at the same time, none can stop the pursuit. This seems to be the tragedy of human life; nay the life of every being. Every pursuit is limited: space-wise, time-wise and object-wise. Any pursuit that is limited cannot give everlasting happiness.Some promise the eternal happiness after death, if one follows their path; yet none has returned to claim that they accomplished it by following that path.One sage declares that ‘truth is a pathless land’. 

My research experience & advaitic research cames to a conclusion that Happiness can be easily get or searched using the Dvaitic way (or Dual approach only) . Although it may lead to grabbing, greedyness if some one doesn't have a control on the senses. How ever, if some one makes himself or programmed with desire less ness and ready to take whatever is presented or existing for that day , then i feel one can happy with dvaitic approach also. Caution is that this is for that DAY.

"Vedanta ascertainsthat the truth is beyond the space-time-object wise limitations, and you arethat truth – tat tvam asi. The ‘Journey Beyond’ space-time limitations isthe central theme of the discussions in this text."

We all need you help & Guidance in Vedantic ascertains to overcome the mind-body-space-time limitations and we would like to listen and learn from you more in this aspects and hope you might have addressed these details in the recent book..
How ever, i am going to contradict or may arise questions on any aspects which do not agreed by Tarka/mimansa and request you for a constructive knowledge based arguments in the due course of time. 

Sri Guru Padaravindarpana Mastu
