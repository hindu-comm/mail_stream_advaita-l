Dear Dr. Sadananda Garu,
                                                 Thank you for the information and web link & I will get that book , go through it and debate with you for any apprehensions/doubts in the concepts for the Journey beyond: A non-dual approach.

"Everyone is searching for happiness that is everlasting. Yet, none can find it by any pursuit; at the same time, none can stop the pursuit. This seems to be the tragedy of human life; nay the life of every being. Every pursuit is limited: space-wise, time-wise and object-wise. Any pursuit that is limited cannot give everlasting happiness.Some promise the eternal happiness after death, if one follows their path; yet none has returned to claim that they accomplished it by following that path.One sage declares that ‘truth is a pathless land’. 

My research experience & advaitic research cames to a conclusion that Happiness can be easily get or searched using the Dvaitic way (or Dual approach only) . Although it may lead to grabbing, greedyness if some one doesn't have a control on the senses. How ever, if some one makes himself or programmed with desire less ness and ready to take whatever is presented or existing for that day , then i feel one can happy with dvaitic approach also. Caution is that this is for that DAY.

"Vedanta ascertainsthat the truth is beyond the space-time-object wise limitations, and you arethat truth – tat tvam asi. The ‘Journey Beyond’ space-time limitations isthe central theme of the discussions in this text."

We all need you help & Guidance in Vedantic ascertains to overcome the mind-body-space-time limitations and we would like to listen and learn from you more in this aspects and hope you might have addressed these details in the recent book..
How ever, i am going to contradict or may arise questions on any aspects which do not agreed by Tarka/mimansa  and request you for a constructive knowledge based arguments in the due course of time.
