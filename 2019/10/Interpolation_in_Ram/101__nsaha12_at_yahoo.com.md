Dear list,

Namaste!
Please see if you could respond to Professor Bhattacharya's query below (who I've marked a copy to).
''Do you know any Sanskritist well versed in the tenets of textual criticism? My question is: Are the long Additional Passages in the critical editions of the Harivamza, Mahabharata, RamayaNa, etc. to be treatedas interpolations or not''.



With regards,Sincerely yours,Niranjan Saha, PhD (London), PhD (ABD), Madras; FRAS
