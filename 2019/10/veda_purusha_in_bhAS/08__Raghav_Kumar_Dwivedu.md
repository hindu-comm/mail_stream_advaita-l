Namaste
There was a reference somewhere in upsniShad-bhAShya to the glory of a
GYAnI being almost like the  'Veda purusha' i.e., Ishvara himself.

A search online did not get me any results. I recollect it was in one of
the 8 smaller Upanishad bhAshyas and in the introduction or sambandha to
one of the adhyayas.

If anyone recollects something similar, I request you to share it.

Om

Raghav
