Raghav ji,

It is in the Paramahamsopanishad:

https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/parama.html?lang=en-IN

 स एव  वेदपुरुषो महापुरुषो यस्तच्चित्तं मय्येवावतिष्ठते ।

This is cited almost at the end of the last chapter of the 'Jivanmukti
viveka' of Swami Vidyaranya.

*I did not get a ref. for this term in the prasthana traya bhashya. Maybe
the Vartika or Anandagiri or any other commentary has it. *

warm regards
subbu
