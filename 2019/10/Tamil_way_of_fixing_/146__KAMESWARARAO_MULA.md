Dear sir,         it would have been 8 October 2019 (Ashwayuja Shukla
dashami) for Telugus and also the rest of India.

 I think it will be same if you follow the  lunar calendar rather than the solar calendar. Thats how mostpeople have been practicing. In the event they have missed the lunar tithi only then the following tithi that corresponds with solar month is taken.

try this sir, if it worksI might not have answered your query correctly but got the question.

 Namaste
I observed that to fix the annual Shraddha date, the Tamil procedure is to
note the thithi of death and note the solar month (saMkramaNAnta mAsa) and
then the next year the same *sankramaNa-anta* month is first chosen and
then the same paxa and thithi are looked for to fix the annual ceremony for
the departed. They don't use the amAvAsyAnta mAsa to reference the D.o.D.


For example some one who passed away on 19 October 2018 (shukla paxa
dashami of lunar month Ashwayuja or solar month 'aipasi') will have the
annual Shraddha on 6 November 2019 (aipasi Shukla dashami) according to
Tamil procedure while it would have been 8 October 2019 (Ashwayuja Shukla
dashami) for Telugus and also the rest of India.

I request learned members to clarify if what I wrote above is correct.

Om
Raghav
