Dear Members,

STORY FROM CHAPTER4:

Suta Puranikcontinues the story: The releasedfrom the custody the merchants were returning home. They reached the outskirtsof their town in their ship. The Lord in order to test them again comes in theform of an old Sanyasi and inquires as to what the load in the ship is. Themerchant bluffs and says that it contains dried leaves. The sanyasi says"Tathasthu". When the merchant returns to the ship he finds that itdoes contain now dried leaves only. He swoons and when he regains hisconsciousness he realizes that these are doings of the Sanyasi whom he hadcursorily dismissed earlier. He seeks him out and begs for forgiveness. Theever-merciful Lord again forgives him. Now that the merchant was near the town,he sends a messenger in advance to Lilavathi to let her know that they are ontheir way home. Lilavathi tells her daughter to complete the Satyanarayanapoola they were performing and goes ahead to meet her husband. Kalavathi doesthe pooja, but in a hurry to meet her husband, she neglects to take the prasad, and when she nears the Qanchorage, she does not find the ship nor her husband!It looked to her that they both sank/drowned. She swoons and now she decides todie. The merchant thinks that this must be on account of some fault on theirpart in ignoring the Lord and then and there he decides to do the pooja as apart of expiation from his side for mistakes of omission or commission. TheLord now pleased makes him realize that it is the daughter’s oversight in notaccepting the prasad that has created this problem and now if she goes andtakes the prasad, everything would be all right. Kalavathi returned to thealtar and took prasad with all faith and reverence. And her husband returnedand from then onwards, they all performed Sri Sathyanarayana Pooja regularlytill the end of their life and finally after death, they reached Satyaloka.
I learnt from my elder that this vratam is very auspicious whendoes on any day of Kartik masa , especially on Devotthani Ekadasi or Kartika Pournami.In Kartika Masa Bholenath exisists as "KARTIK DAMODARA" i.e
Shivaaya Vishnu Roopaaya, Shiva Roopaaya Vishanave |
Shivasya Hrudayam Vishnur, Vishnuscha Hrudayam Shivaha ||
Yatha Shivamayo Vishnuhu, Yevam Vishnu Mayaha Shivaha |
Yathaantharam Na Paschyaami, Thatha Me Swasthi Ra Yushi ||

“As is if you find Shiva , you have found Vishnu. They are one and the same. Until a person dont find any difference between these two, he will be safe and long living"

“yo vishnu bhakthivyajena, shiva bhakthichhalena vaa |
dvestinaa shankaram vishnum, tham gruhnidvam mamanthikam ||
~~ AGNI PURANA!

“Bring them to me "people who hates vishnu in the name of shiva and people who hates shiva in the name of vishnu" said yama.
Om Namo Narayana ~ Om Namah Shivaya
HINDU is not a religion, it is a way of life with ethics i.e DHARMA.He who lives through out the life and makes others (gives space) to live.All the festivals of this Karmic land Bharat was mentioned in the scriptures as per the 'Kala Chakra' and exists to protect the Dharma and I strongly believe that there exsists people, who may be in silence most of the times but protectors of the sampradaya, achara & ethics.
Aswiyuja Krishna Amavasya (Deepvali)Wish you all a Happy, Prosperous and Green Diwali
Sri Guru Padaravindarpana Mastu
