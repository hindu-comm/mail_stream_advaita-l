praNAms Sri Sriram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

My teacher told me that advaita sampradaya considers both to be equal here.

>  Yes both are equal since tattva is one and the same one is jneya brahma and other is upAsya brahma for krama mukti.  When Ishwara viewed with parichinna drushti i.e. upAdhi vishesha drushti he is avidyAkruta from tattva drushti as he does not have any limitations due to his association with upAdhi-s.  The vAsudeva tattvaM is nothing but jeeva tattvaM ( svarUpa of jeeva) hence from the tattva drushti jeeva, saguNa brahman and jagat etc. are brahman only for the jnAni lord clarifies this by saying 'sarva bhAvena bhArata'.  And as a matter of fact even for the krama mukta jeeva-s the capability of doing the srushti is not there, it is an exclusive right of Ishwara only.  Hence bhAshyakAra says all veda-s would talk about srushti citing  the Ishwara as the cause.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
