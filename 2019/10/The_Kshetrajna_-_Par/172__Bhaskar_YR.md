I have always wondered on the conspicuous usage by BhashyakAra regarding kshetrajna-Ishwara-ekatva. He never used kshetrajna-Brahman-ekatva.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

While talking about phala of shAstra janita jnana bhAshyakAra clarifies in Geeta bhAshya itself that (in the second chapter I think) the shAstra as the final pramANa would remove the very 'knowership' (jnAtrutvaM) of Atman.  It is quite obvious that jnAtru, jneya and jnana is only in vyavahAra where duality holds sway.  Since Atman is na antaH prajna nor bahirprajnA he is not the knower of something else apart from HIM.  For the brahma jnAni both kshetra and kshetrajna are one and the same.  BruhadAraNyaka explains this when one becomes / realizes that all is One (sarvAtman)  what he could see and through what !!?? 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
