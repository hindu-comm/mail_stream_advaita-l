Pranams Sada ji,

Very nicely stated. Shankara says in the Brahma sutra bhashya 2.2.44:

Not just the four (Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, the
entire universe from Brahmaa to the smallest creature, is the vyuuha,
manifestation, of Brahman as per the Veda.

न चैते भगवद्व्यूहाश्चतुःसंख्यायामेवावतिष्ठेरन् , ब्रह्मादिस्तम्बपर्यन्तस्य
समस्तस्यैव जगतो भगवद्व्यूहत्वावगमात् ॥ ४४ ॥

warm regards
