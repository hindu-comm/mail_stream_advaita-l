Here is an article in Kannada on the topic:

https://www.facebook.com/groups/vedaonline/permalink/2439269613009302/

One feature of the article is: It shows how Buddhists themselves do not
subscribe to the idea of Vishnu's Avatara.   It is akin to saying 'Ramanuja
and Madhva themselves did not acknowledge Shankara as a vaishnava.'

A very interesting article and I hope the author or someone would translate
it to English for wider reach.
