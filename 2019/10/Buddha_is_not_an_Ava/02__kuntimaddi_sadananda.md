Subbuji - PraNAms
Everybody is an avatar of Vishnu - the very first name in the Vishnusahasranaamaavali is - viswam. The whole universe is Vishnu. And the second name is Vishnu - vyaapakatvaat - who pervades the whole universe as the very substratum. However, we revere those avatars who devoted themselves not only to realize the above truth but to try to uplift the society at large. We do not follow the teachings of Buddha since some of the teachings are not in-tune with Vedanta.
Hari Om!Sadananda

 Here is an article in Kannada on the topic:

One feature of the article is: It shows how Buddhists themselves do not
subscribe to the idea of Vishnu's Avatara. It is akin to saying 'Ramanuja
and Madhva themselves did not acknowledge Shankara as a vaishnava.'

A very interesting article and I hope the author or someone would translate
it to English for wider reach.

regards
subbu
