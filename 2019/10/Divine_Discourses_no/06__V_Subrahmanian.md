On the holy occasion of the 102nd Jayanti of the 35th Acharya of the
Peetham, Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji, Sri Vidyatheertha
Foundation is pleased to offer the e-book, ‘Divine Discourses’ for free
download.

The e-book, ‘Divine Discourses’, contains the English translations of 11
benedictory discourses of the Jagadguru delivered extempore in the period
1986-1989. Nine of these sacred discourses were in Kannada and two in
Tamil. A special feature of this book is the inclusion of the six holy
speeches delivered by His Holiness that provide the most authoritative
account of His Guru’s (Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamiji)
life and achievements.

They also give a thorough account of the nature and role of a Sadguru, a
knower of the Truth; all that a spiritual aspirant needs to know about a
Sadguru is contained in the book. Download the book at
