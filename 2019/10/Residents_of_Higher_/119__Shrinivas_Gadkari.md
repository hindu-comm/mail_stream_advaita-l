Namaste,

Residents of higher loka-s are masters of yoga, and veda-s. They have
achieved perfection in multiple vidyA-s. Indra has mastered brahma vidyA(s)
long time ago, and very possible shAstra too. He is an advanced yogi and bhakta.

They may have not achieved ultimate perfection - but they are very ahead in the
journey.

Regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari
