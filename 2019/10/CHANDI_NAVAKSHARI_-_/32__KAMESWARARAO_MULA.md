MADHYAMA CHARITA (RAJO GUNA OF JIVA – KRIYA AND VAIRAGYA)


It represents the KRIYA of Rajo Guna. Tthe Kriya is the Vigorous Activity which is of Rajo Guna Swarupa. And hence, samputikarana with Maya Bija (HRIM) is performed. The presiding deity of this Madhyama Charita is Mahalakshmi, which is the Rajasika Sakti of Iswara. Para Prakriti manifests as Rajo Guna in Ishwara and Apara Prakriti manifests as Rajo Guna in the form of Vairagya (Dispassion and Detachment) for the Jiva. The Madhyama Charitra is the symbolic representation of Vishnu Granthi Bedhana where Sanchita Karma of the Jiva is reduced to ashes.

With the elimination of the tendency to experience the pleasure in manifold that are Madhu and Kaitabha in Prathama Charita (1st Phase of the Spiritual Journey), there are still some remnants of this manifold expression, the metaphysical aspects of attachments and self-regarding impulse which is the external manifestation of Rajo Guna in the form of Mahishasura. The Jiva enters into the 2nd Cycle which is the realm of Internal Manifestation of Rajo Guna with Para Vairagya. At this point, there is a constant tug-of-war between his antarmukha vikasa of Rajo Guna (Para Vairagya) and Bahirmukha Vikasa of Rajo Guna (Krodha in the form of Mahishasura) . Uproots his external manifestation of Rajo Guna (Mahishasura) with detachment and self-analysis (Antarmukha Vikasa of Rajo Guna). At the end of this 2nd phase, the aspirant starts enquiring of about his own true self. The process of self-enquiry ie., the nature of “I” starts here.Madhyama Charita and its Secret;There is a constant tug-of-war between Gods and Demons and in the process; the portfolios of the Gods are hijacked by demons. The introvert senses that are turned towards the source of individual are Gods and the extrovert senses that are turned towards the objects external of individual are Demons ie., Antarmukha Vikasa of Indriyas are Devatas and Bahirmukha Vikasa of the Indriyas are Asuras. In Madhyama Charita, Antarmukha Vikasa of Rajo Guna is Vairagya, Sama, Dama, Titiksha, Uparati etc. which is lead by Vairagya (Indra). The Bahirmukha Vikasa of Rajo Guna is Kama, Krodha, Lobha which leads by Krodha (Mahishasura) .
The demons are the manifestations of Vikshepa, Avarana, Darpa, Dambha, Bhoga Lalasa, Lobha, Moha, Krodha, Sarira Bala, Abhimana, Dosha Drishti, Akshama, Nishturata, Dvesha respectively.

The Para Prakriti manifests as Rajasika Sakti as Mahalakshmi and Apara Prakriti manifests as Antarmukha Vikasa of Rajo Guna in the Jiva as Para Vairagya. Jiva in this state of Antarmukha Vikasa of Rajo Guna annihilates the Bahirvikasa of Rajo Guna in the form of Mahishasura. This act of annihilation requires more force and violent activity to remove from one’s continuum. And hence, there should be a collected and concentrated effort of Mind (Brahma), Praana – Vital Force (Vishnu) and Jnana (Siva). This effort collectively manifests one’s latent Divine Consciousness (Durga). The Human Consciousness adhering to the path of righteousness is the Dharma. This Dharma is the Lion. The Divine Consciousness (Durga) alighted on Dharma (Lion) conquers the impulse of Rajo Guna. This elimination of Mahishasura (the Bahirmukha Vikasa of Rajo Guna) paves the way for Antarmukha Vikasa of the Jiva which is Para Vairagya.Now the Self-Enquiry starts. The Jivabegins to enquire his true self. Thus, the Jiva merges with Rajo Rupa Para Prakriti. This Charita establishes the “SAT” aspect of Chit-Sat-Ananda rupa Brahman. SAT denotes the all-pervading Existence Absolute and HRIM is the Bija for this Cycle.
