This is just a beginning for the spiritual aspirant. The spiritual aspirant has a long way to go till he merges in Absolute. Sruti says “Atma Vaare Drshtavyah, Srotavyah, Mantavyah, Nidhidhyasitvyah". The Flash of Divine Consciousness in his Intellect is the first step towards the Journey. The nature of the Consciousness has to be logically analysed with the help of scriptures and at each and every step one has to do comparative analysis between what has been said in the scriptures with his own experience. Has to be reflected upon, meditated and prepare oneself for final union with the Divine. These 3 cycles are the 3 phases of the spiritual aspirant that pave the way for Jiva-Brahma- Aikya. Annihilating the two tendencies desire to be many which is Bahu-bhava Iccha (Kaitabha) and sense of seeking pleasure by becoming manifold which is Bahutva Ananda (Madhu) in the 1st cycle, enters into the 2nd cycle which is Madhyama Charita.
Although In one of the previous e-mails, Sh.Sankaranarayanan, very senior member ofambal/advaita-list mentions once that Chandi parayana (Reciting of Druga Saptasati -700slouches), that it should be onlymentfor Parayana's/recitations &No where itwas mentioned the same to perform Havan.(idon't have reference to contradict his statement) But I disagree here. Since All actions & activities are performed for Kamyabadi (sprituality/money/profession/fame/children/health/or anymaterialistic things), soinorder to reach god/godess, it should be through fire i.e Havan only. So There is nothing wrong to perform Chandi Havan although there is no mention of its havan form in the scriptures. As for a Kamyabadiparkriyas or to full fill any desires, one can perform samputikarana i.e recite thetargeted (ichha) slokainfront of all the Chapters for the recitation to Parayana/ or Havan so that it will leads to its results. In reailty, It happens inPractically also for which I have many examples in the several people's life's.
We used toperform several Chandi Yagamsduring Navaratriauspicious days (that was the reason to post theseseries of writeups toremember those things with my understandings) in the presence of lotus feet over aperiod of time, My Master used to use 13 fruits/vegatables one for each adhyaya's whosereferences he collected using difference source by combining the attributes of thegoddess in different chapters which Imentions here.
After the completion of each chapter we used to recite: नमो देव्यै महादेव्यै शिवायै सततं नम:।नम: प्रकृत्यै भदायै नियता: प्रणता: स्मताम्।।, Sangayeyi, saparivarayei, savahanayeyi, (kali chamunda deveyei) (mahalakshmeyi/mahasaraswatyei/shkati lakshemyei/chahnes for thegoddess of that particular chapter), Nagavavalli dhalairyuta kunkumarchita sagrhutam________particular fruit, hosyami nama swaha for each chapter.
