I am student of Advaita Vedanta since the last 10 years or so. I have
studied intermittently under teachers of the Arsha Vidya Gurukulam. I would
like to participate in the mailing list to get better understanding of the
multifarious aspects of the subject.

I am an advocate practicing in the Delhi High Court and thr Supreme Court of
India. I stay in Delhi. I am 44 year of age I have been interested in
Advaita Vedanta now for more than two decades. I have read a few writings of
Swami Vivekananda, part of Gospel of Ramakrishna and some of the literature
of Ramkrishna Ashram. At the moment I am reading Tattva Bodha, Translated by
SW Sunirmalananda, a Monk of Ramakrishna Mission order. I am interested in
the talks and discussions on the Philosophy of Advaita Vedanta till I get
hooked up to the real theme behind it.
