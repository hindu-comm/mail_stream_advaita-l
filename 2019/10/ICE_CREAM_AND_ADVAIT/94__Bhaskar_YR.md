Just today I experienced this !!!  I usually all alone go for lunch to the office canteen late afternoon  so that I can avoid useless talks,  wear the earphones and listen to the vedic chants or discourses. My dept. colleagues in group who always go for lunch much earlier to me came back today to their seats, as usual, I just asked them about today’s menu.  They told ice cream and fruit salad, the special items served today apart from regular menu.  Once in a fortnight my office canteen will serve these special items.  When I went to canteen for lunch I noticed a big & unusual change in the  ice cream flavor and quantity being served in canteen.  Eversince I joined ABB, irrespective of changes in  canteen contracts, for  the past couple of decades we the employees,  invariably used to have only one flavor of ice cream that is butter scotch in  a fixed quantity 10ml cup 😊   but, to my surprise, today,  I got ice cream with vanilla flavor and comparatively in a bigger cup !!??  My colleagues are quite meticulous in noticing these conspicuous changes but today without briefing this ‘change’ they simply said ‘ice cream’.  I asked them about this after coming back to my seat, one of my colleagues said in Kannadda :  yaava flavor aadre yenu ??  yellaa ice cream taane..(no matter which flavor it is, it is only ice cream) !!??  I am still wondering the depth of  Advaita jnana of my colleagues who hardly give any attention to nAma, rUpa and ruchi vikAra and highlighting the tattva part in ice cream 😊  I reckon Advaita jnana is quite intrinsic in our very nature as we are adviteeya 😊

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
