Namaste

I went to a shop to buy some provisions. The shop keeper was chatting with
me. He said in Nandini milk we buy they mix all types of milk like cow
milk, goat milk, sheep milk, buffalo milk and dog's milk also. We drink it
as Milk. The seller thinks all types of milk are the same. He is using
Advaita Tattwa. All milk is One.
