Namaste

when we say क  we don't say first क् and then अ. It is a combined sound क.
In combining the क् and अ half Matra is lost and one Matra only remains.
Similarly for का there will be 2 Matras remaining after combining.

It is like Ardha Nareeshwara. One Siva plus One Sakti will remain One. Not
Two. Or Brahman Plus Maayaa is still One. Not Two.
