Vamshidhara’s explanation of Sridhara Swamin’s verse

At the beginning of his commentary to the Srimadbhagavatam, Sridhara
Swamin, the most eminent commentator of the text, pays obeisance to Hari
and Hara in a beautiful verse:

माधवोमाधवावीशौ सर्वसिद्धिविधायिनौ। वन्दे परस्परात्मानौ परस्परनुतिप्रियौ॥

I bow to Mādhava and Umādhava (Shiva) who are both 'Isha-s' Supreme Lords. They
are capable of bestowing all accomplishments (to their devotees). They are
both the selves of each other and both love to engage in the stuti of each
other.
Vamshidhara, the expounder of Sridhara swamin's commentary, explains this
verse with copious citations from scriptural texts. This is available in
the link below:
