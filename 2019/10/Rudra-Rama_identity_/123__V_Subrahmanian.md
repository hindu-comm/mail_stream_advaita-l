Raghav ji,

// The Nava Tirthas of the place are Chandra Pushkarani, Bilva Tirtha,
Jambu Tirtha AÅŸwatha Tirtha, Palasa Tirtha, Punnaha Tirtha, Varuna Tirtha,
Kadamba Tirtha and Amra Tirtha. //

vicinity.  Such a combination gains sanctity over time.

It could also be a specific place in Tamil Nadu/close to Lankapuri.  Some
others could give a clearer picture.

subbu
