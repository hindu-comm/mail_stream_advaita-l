Dear Members,
                         Parikshit also known as VISHNURATA as he was protected dearly by Lord Vishnu in the womb of Uttara which she conceived from Abhimanyu during the Mahabharata war.  He was the grand son of Arjuna and saved by Krishna against the Brahmmastra shooted by Aswatthama againt the pandava's. Krishna thought that Parikshit & his son Janamejeya's presence is required  to rule the Kuru kingdom in the later years and that is the reason Parikishit is very dear to Vishnu and whoomsever he mets he will see Vishnu's form in his face. 

Janamejeya is supposed to be the first ruler of Kaliyuga and Whole Mahabharat was narrated to him by Vaisampayana a disciple of Vyasya.
