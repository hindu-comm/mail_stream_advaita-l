Thanks for posting about the audio rendering.?? There is a magnum opus on 
saundaryalaharI by Sri Sri Radhakrishna SastrigaL. It has the text of 9 
different commentaries in devanAgAri?? and their thamizh translation.

Sastrigal's contribution?? to many different subjects is amazing. He has 
translated entire vaidyanAtha dIkShitIyam in thamizh. The books I have 
seen, includes the mulam.?? Most of his books are available in 
archive.org.?? (https://archive.org/details/S.V.RadhakrishnaSastriBooks)
