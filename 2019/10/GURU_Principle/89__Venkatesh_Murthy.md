Namaste

Kindly don't drag me into this discussion. I am doing very concentrated Sri
Sukta Parayana these days because of some financial issues. On Deepavali
Amavasya I have decided to do Sri Sukta Japa hundreds of times. Kindly
excuse me. I am busy.

This is not an easy talk, to walk on this path, one has to give up everything which was earned materialistically and then divine/nature/guru opens the doars automatically. To achieve this one has to submit/surrender completely to the 'Guru Principle' and there is no-half surrender in any approach.

Ultimately the Human of the guru (what ever may be reason avidya/prarabda) is also passing in his karmic time, he will have an edge biased approach on his karmic people against the disciple's interests.  There is nothing wrong in that approach? If any one exists in that place, they will also act like this. If some one goes against that approach, or wants to behave differently, he will face hell of time from his family members, there is no other way for any body in giving the prime importance to the karmic relations (whether it is son/daughter/brother/father).

The important person of the life can be known to the consciousness ONLY and varies from individual to individual. No one can put it that one paper or write that.
