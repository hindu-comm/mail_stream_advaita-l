In one of the earlier postings, I have given this reference if the enlightenment doesn't happen within one year of initiation  one can abadon his guru and the disciple can even test him,

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Very interesting.  Is that reference says enlightenment is an one year course after initiation??  ğŸ˜Š I really doubt.  We can not say to our guru, see you have initiated me one year back and today is the last day i.e. 365th day, if I donâ€™t get the enlightenment before mid-night today your term as guru is over, from tomorrow onwards you are no more my guru and ready for fresh and tough test from me  ğŸ˜Š  Just on the lighter vein ğŸ˜Š 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
