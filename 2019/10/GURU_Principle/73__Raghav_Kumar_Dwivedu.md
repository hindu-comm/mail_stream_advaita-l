Yes Andrew Cohen is a classic example of the pitfall of pre-mature
guru-dom.

http://americanguru.net/

It's far cry from the vedAntic idea of
shrotriya and brahma-niShTha alone being well-equipped to be a guru in the
complete sense.

As for the rest, we can always take a few constructive tidbits of
witticisms and nice words from even half-baked gurus. But no question of
"surrendering" one's 'tan-man-dhan' to such wannabe gurus.

But the unfortunate thing is that many followers will be in denial about
their gurus' misdemeanours even when confronted with facts. They will
continue to believe in alternative facts. It requires enormous divine grace
to discover Advaita and the impersonal teaching tradition or paramparA
where the nondual knowledge that arises is independent of the personality
of the guru.
