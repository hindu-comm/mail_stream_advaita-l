Mantrartha Devata jneya Devata Guru rupini. 
Tesham veda na kartavya Yadeechhe-chhbhamatmanah  (Tarapradeepa)

The letters comprising the Mantra are indeed the deity, the deity is none other than the Guru. He who cares for his own welfare will make no distinction between the Mantra, Guru and the deity.
So you see, the respectful disciple holds fast to the Mantra even if it does not grow sentient all at once. He looks to his own shortcomings and tries to correct his own failings by right observances, pure food, study of sacred texts, holy association and so on, he will not lay his ears open to be whispered into by any and every man on the false plea of his Guru’s incompetence. He lays bare his soul’s distress at the feet of his own Guru and asks him how his Mantra may grow sentient. The Guru too leads the respectful disciple along the way laid down in Shastras for having the Mantra activated. That is how his Mantra becomes instinct with life and he is gratified. Shraddha or reverence is the soul of all sadhana. Where that is wanting, achievement is impossible.
Avidyo va Savidyo va Guru reva cha daivatam 
Amargasthopi margastho guru reva sada gatih  (Nigama kalpadruma)
“Be he learned or ignorant, the Guru is a God to the disciple. No matter whether he follows the right or wrong course, he remains the only resort for the disciple.”
