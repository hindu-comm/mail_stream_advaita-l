if we come across some questionable behavior of our accepted guru/s and attacks on the same from other tradition jagadguru shishya-s, we always have the justification in the form of avidyA lesha, prArabdha, have the ready reference that brahma vidya is sva-hrudaya pratyaya no one should doubt or deny  it, he is not bound in BMI, though he looks like doing, doing nothing

My self too experienced some aspects in this which I never reveal publically , but what  I feel is that  Prarabdha exists for anybody on this earth whether he is guru/disciple/master/servant. Yes it is true that some people make use of time very cleverly to take their karmic bondage people ahead of time at the cost of disciple's interest and god only can save those karmic people.

Any body can justify any thing, but  some one keeps on prolonging the matter or wants to break the knot towards their personal benefits, they can do that by keeping fear in their mind.
Natures eyes are always watching the dramatic/language skills of the mockery people for which they will pay the big price for themselves and turn into pathless life. 

we have right to reject him and search for another guru.  I forgot that reference.

In one of the earlier postings, I have given this reference if the enlightenment doesn't happen within one year of initiation  one can abadon his guru and the disciple can even test him, How ever an Ideal disciple never leave his trusted guru , but not at the cost of self-being deceived for their karmic benefits.
