I strongly condemn in taking the name of
the guru, sampraday in public forums for the advertizement sake.

For what its worth Swami Shivananda was quite proud of being a descendent of Shri Appayya Dikshita and mentions this repeatedly in his writings.The problem is more the kind of person who will e.g. do "Je-Je" to themurti of Shankaracharya on a day like this or to some other Guru and boastabout him with flowery words but not internalize his teachings and put
them into practice in his own life.
Dear Sir,       In the past, I have made a statement that about the taking name of the Guru publicly which was pointed out nicely by Sh. Jaldhar Vyas, since I felt like that to talk like that with my experience which is not applicable to all. I have seen many people who have fallen by only doing this. Here are my examples which I saw to pitfall in this syndromes.
I have studied my intermediate & Graduation in the same college of for 5 yrs which is the foundation stone for my advaita urge towards reaching brahmman and learnt many things about life aspects in that period. There used to be a extraordinary vedic pandit(still he exists) who is the veda-pariksha -adhikari in that place. By virtue of his lineage, he is also a sri-vidyopasaka and he has two beautiful sons who just look like milky aswini kumara's and gained all the knowledge from their father (inherited by birth) below the age of 10 yrs. These two boys used to come to local chandaramouliswara temple and mesmerise all the people there with their melodic vedic chantings (Rigved/yajurved). There used to be one extraordinary intelligent disciple at this vedic pandit and taken sri-vidya purnadiksha (no vedic knowledge). This so called intelligent Disciple always used to talk that this was told by my guru ......and used to prostate him for all purposes (although there is no purpose exists) and wants to compair everything with the two sons of that vedic pandit. Since by virtue of time & the by the grace of that vedic pandit, he often used to mention to everybody that he is senior and will be the authoritative on behalf of his guru. He used to all nonsense & performed many vulnerable acts due to his seniority syndrome. Due to this attitude of that disciple, the vedic pandit lost his second sone (don't know the reason for the death, but everyone there proclaims that this disciple is responsible for that)
The point I would like to make from this story was out of the two sons of the vedic pandits, elder one was his brother (karmic relation) & the second one was his heart (as he came from his fathers mind), it seems, the vedic pandit is still living at the age of above 75 along with his elders at that place with the grief of their loss of second son. Still the vedic pandit accepts this arrogant disciple as his disciple (thinking that he is his second son, forgetting the senoirty issue).
The one who strives and struggles tounderstand and assimilate each word does not fall in that category and hasevery right to proclaim public pride in his intellectual heritage

Yes Vyas Mahaseya,                I fully agree with you here that the one who wants to assimilate each word has always have a right to proclaim the pride of his intellectual heritage just like the shankaracahrya parampara goes from several years, but not the so called disciple's attitude in the story which I mentioned.ultimately, who can go in between the Guru-shishya relationship , as I feel that Guru-Sishya are same although physical bodies are different, as the guru transmits his power to the disciple and he exists in him, and the sishya with that seeding power raised to that guru's knowledge and merges with him which can only be possible in this karmic land bharat.

Sir,    I agree with this view upto some extent, But if you think in the other way, byeknowing fully about witticisms and cheatingpersonalitiesof the some of the Wannable Pre-matured Guru Dom personalities, If you surrender for the 'Guru Principle' (not for his cheating personality orphysical Human form) for the time being with faith towards guru mandala, we are not going loose anything eternally,off course these type ofbeggersmay take the material benefits (including money,karmic relations), We can remain still the same what ever we are and we can stand there where we started our journey.
These Begger Pre-matured Guru-dom personalities (i may be harsh in using these words, but present scenarios are like this to follow thisapproach only to call them as wrong numbers) , yours words areappopriate as Half-baked can'T progress in their sadhana and will going to fall in deepswells for their un-ethical attitude of taking theirkarmic bonded people ahead of timeagainst the interest of the Disciples interests. Apart from this , I have some bitter examples which Ican't put it here, some of thecrucked idiots in the name of thespiritualism by making the themockery of thevidya's what ever they know are wasting & sucking the blood of the several youngsters who are in search of Advatic-Vedantic knowledge towards reaching Brahmman. We need to put a full stop for these type ofactivities and time has come to show themtheir place of stand and make them accountable for all of their activities.
But the unfortunate thing is that many followers will be in denial about
their gurus' misdemeanours even when confronted with facts. They will
continue to believe in alternative facts.

If facts (evidences) will let us know his mindemeanours acts, as you said, Ideal disciple continue to believe in alternative facts (bypassed approaches) and for them their foundation store is strong FAITH & BELIEF IN GURU Principle.
 It requires enormous divine graceto discover Advaita and the impersonal teaching tradition or paramparAwhere the nondual knowledge that arises is independent of the personalityof the guru.
My self is the Best example for this, Divine grace is always with the followers of the Guru Principle /Guru Mandala, I can assure you that Divine stands with the Disiciple's who works selflessly in reaching the Brahmman &reaching the parampara. As you said correctly, NON-DUALITY automaticallyarises in the disciples independent of thepersonalities of the guru.
I am happy to read & understand your nice critics about these pitfalls and at least people arecoming ahead now to puttheir views/wordsopenly rather than keeping silence. Although silence is best at most of times, But time has come no more silence is required and we need to work it out to put a full STOPabout these pitfalls and save our Traditions/cultures/beliefs and say Tata Good Bye to these pre-matured Guru syndrome Holders for which I dedicate my life time inuplifting our deep rooted guru parampara tradition and May I request you to join in my missiontoward reaching the Guru Mandala in ahead of time.
Please contribute your views.

 Yes Andrew Cohen is a classic example of the pitfall of pre-mature
guru-dom.

It's far cry from the vedAntic idea of
shrotriya and brahma-niShTha alone being well-equipped to be a guru in the
complete sense.

As for the rest, we can always take a few constructive tidbits of
witticisms and nice words from even half-baked gurus. But no question of
"surrendering" one's 'tan-man-dhan' to such wannabe gurus.
