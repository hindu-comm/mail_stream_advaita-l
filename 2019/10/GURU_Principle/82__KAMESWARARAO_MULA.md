we can always take a few constructive tidbits of
witticisms and nice words from even half-baked gurus. But no question of
"surrendering" one's 'tan-man-dhan' to such wannabe gurus.

Sir,    I agree with this view upto some extent, But if you think in the other way, byeknowing fully about witticisms and cheatingpersonalitiesof the some of the Wannable Pre-matured Guru Dom personalities, If you surrender for the 'Guru Principle' (not for his cheating personality orphysical Human form) for the time being with faith towards guru mandala, we are not going loose anything eternally,off course these type ofbeggersmay take the material benefits (including money,karmic relations), We can remain still the same what ever we are and we can stand there where we started our journey.
These Begger Pre-matured Guru-dom personalities (i may be harsh in using these words, but present scenarios are like this to follow thisapproach only to call them as wrong numbers) , yours words areappopriate as Half-baked can'T progress in their sadhana and will going to fall in deepswells for their un-ethical attitude of taking theirkarmic bonded people ahead of timeagainst the interest of the Disciples interests. Apart from this , I have some bitter examples which Ican't put it here, some of thecrucked idiots in the name of thespiritualism by making the themockery of thevidya's what ever they know are wasting & sucking the blood of the several youngsters who are in search of Advatic-Vedantic knowledge towards reaching Brahmman. We need to put a full stop for these type ofactivities and time has come to show themtheir place of stand and make them accountable for all of their activities.
But the unfortunate thing is that many followers will be in denial about
their gurus' misdemeanours even when confronted with facts. They will
continue to believe in alternative facts.

If facts (evidences) will let us know his mindemeanours acts, as you said, Ideal disciple continue to believe in alternative facts (bypassed approaches) and for them their foundation store is strong FAITH & BELIEF IN GURU Principle.
 It requires enormous divine graceto discover Advaita and the impersonal teaching tradition or paramparAwhere the nondual knowledge that arises is independent of the personalityof the guru.
My self is the Best example for this, Divine grace is always with the followers of the Guru Principle /Guru Mandala, I can assure you that Divine stands with the Disiciple's who works selflessly in reaching the Brahmman &reaching the parampara. As you said correctly, NON-DUALITY automaticallyarises in the disciples independent of thepersonalities of the guru.
I am happy to read & understand your nice critics about these pitfalls and at least people arecoming ahead now to puttheir views/wordsopenly rather than keeping silence. Although silence is best at most of times, But time has come no more silence is required and we need to work it out to put a full STOPabout these pitfalls and save our Traditions/cultures/beliefs and say Tata Good Bye to these pre-matured Guru syndrome Holders for which I dedicate my life time inuplifting our deep rooted guru parampara tradition and May I request you to join in my missiontoward reaching the Guru Mandala in ahead of time.
Please contribute your views.

 Yes Andrew Cohen is a classic example of the pitfall of pre-mature

It's far cry from the vedAntic idea of
shrotriya and brahma-niShTha alone being well-equipped to be a guru in the
complete sense.

As for the rest, we can always take a few constructive tidbits of
witticisms and nice words from even half-baked gurus. But no question of
"surrendering" one's 'tan-man-dhan' to such wannabe gurus.
