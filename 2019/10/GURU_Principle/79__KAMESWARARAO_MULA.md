In one of the earlier postings, I have given this reference if the enlightenment doesn't happen within one year of initiation one can abadon his guru and the disciple can even test him,

Shiva Purana says-Yatrananda prabodhova nalpamapyupalabyata
vatsaradapi sishyena so nyam gurumupashrayet.


“If initiation by a Guru does not fetcheven a slight joy or enlight­enment, the disciple may, on the expiry of a year,approach another Guru.”

What if the second too should fail? And then the third, thefourth, and so on? Should Guru after Guru fail? Is the seeker to pass from Guruto Guru ad infinitum? If all life is spent in quest of the Guru, when willspiritual exercise commence? How can one serve so many Gurus? how can onemanage with so many Mantras? If a man abandons his Mantra, he meets with death; if he abandons his Guru, he is punished, I was told with poverty;in case both are abandoned the result is, confinement berth in Raurava hell.To lend one’s ears to whomsoever one meets is to pave the way to the hell called Raurava. Can even a Siddha Guru prevent it?
It is the seekers vision & vijnata which are prescribed in sastras/nature and the good disciple never abandon his guru no matter however competent he is.
How ever exemptions alwaysexists to abandon people like Guru Titile holders such as Andrew cohen (spritual Teacher)

Very interesting. Is that reference says enlightenment is an one year course after initiation?? 😊 I really doubt. We can not say to our guru, see you have initiated me one year back and today is the last day i.e. 365th day, if I don’t get the enlightenment before mid-night today your term as guru is over, from tomorrow onwards you are no more my guru and ready for fresh and tough test from me 😊 Just on the lighter vein 😊 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
