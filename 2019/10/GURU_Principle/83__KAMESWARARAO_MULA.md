Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj says that it took him three years to realise the
self after hearing his master's words. I think this is mentioned in 'I Am
That'.

I will put here a few of his best Quotes & Messages as such:
My Guru ordered me to attend to the sense ‘I am’ and to give attention to nothing else. I just obeyed. I did not follow any particular course of breathing, or meditation, or study of scriptures. Whatever happened, I would turn away my attention from it and remain with the sense ‘I am’. It may look too simple, even crude. My only reason for doing it was that my Guru told me so. Yet it worked! (I Am That, Chapter 75.)

Just keep in mind the feeling "I am," merge in it, till your mind and feeling become one. By repeated attempts you will stumble on the right balance of attention and affection and your mind will be firmly established in the thought-feeling "I am." (I Am That, Chapter 16.)

Some of the his Best Works in the form of Books other than I am That:
Prior to Consciousness,Seeds of Consciousness,The Ultimate Medicine,The Nectar of Immortality,Consciousness and the Absolute: The final talks of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj,

For few of the Disciples Questions, His answers were quite enlightening & a few of them are here: He continues to say thatWhen the body goes, everything goes,There is no experience of either happiness or unhappiness, there is no need of experience either.Our thinking at a conceptual level. At that level, who is there who wants to know? Forget about That state.Whatever can be understood or perceived can never be the eternal Truth. The Unknown is the Truth. I have no need of any experience, therefore I have no need to quarrel with anybody. The body and mind will go on doing whatever they like during their natural course of duration.Is it better to do one thing than another? For instance, with this mind and body I could just sit and do nothing, or I could go around helping people, doing good things. Which would be better to do?The body and mind will do whatever is natural for that combination.
You can control things – for example you can eat too much or drink too much, things like that – or else you can do good things, helping people, etc.

These are the do’s and don’ts regarding the body-mind, which you are not; that is the premise from where you have started. Understand that when there is no body, consciousness is not conscious of itself. So long as the body is there, the body must do its natural functioning.
