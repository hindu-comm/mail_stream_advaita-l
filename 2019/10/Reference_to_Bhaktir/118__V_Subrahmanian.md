Dear Niranjan ji,

I replied to this post, which I received yesterday too, that the editor of
the pdf that I have of Bhaktirasayanam, has cited this verse in his
foreword.  I could not search in the text proper as I could not give the
time for it. If it had been a searchable document, I would have tried.

warm regards
subbu
