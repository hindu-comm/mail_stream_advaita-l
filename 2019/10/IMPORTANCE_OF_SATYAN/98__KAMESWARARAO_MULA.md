Dear Members,
                        Satyanarayana Swami vari  Puja can be performed on any day for any reason. The best day to perform this Pooja is on the day of Poornima (full moon day) or Ekadasi. He who seeks Dharma, He who seeks wealth, He who seeks pleasures, He who seeks children, Will all without fail, Get what they want.

One can eaily perform this  puja  by a prayer to Lord Ganesha, to remove all obstacles that may occur as a result of incorrectly performing the puja. This is done by chanting all the names of Lord Ganesha and offering prasad (a food offering, usually consisting of one of Lord Ganesha's favorite foods - modak, jaggery khand,  sugar and coconut mixture, or ladu) and the showering of flower petals.

Another part of the vratam involves a prayer & inviting the corner gods (asta dikpalaka's) to the vrata mandapa along with the Navagraha's - the nine important celestial beings in the universe. and worshipping of Lord Sri Satyanarayana, an extremely benevolent form of Lord Vishnu. First "panchamritam" is used to clean the place where the deity is placed. After placing the deity in the correct position, Satyanaraya swami is worshipped. Names of Satyanarayana are chanted along with offering of a variety of prasad (including a mixture of milk, honey, ghee/butter, yogurt, sugar) and flower petals. One can also recite the Vishnu sahasranama during the puja. (It is optional & not compulsory)

There is big story telling of at least 5 chapters (minimum) by suta/saunakadi maha muni's at the naimisaranya is the heart  of the puja and most important  that the story of the puja is to be heard among all those observing and partaking in the pooja. The story involves the origin of the puja, the benefits of it, and the potential mishaps that may occur with the careless performance of the puja. At the end of the each chapter one has to break one narial and the prayer concludes with an Aarti, . After the puja is over, participants and observers of the pooja are required to ingest in the prasad that was offered and blessed by the Lord which  is much more important & celestial than the performing the vratam.

STORY FROM CHAPTER1:
Shri Sathyanaranayana katha is from Skandha purana, Reva kaanda. Sutha Puraanikji was the narrator of these stories, in Neimishaaranya to the rishis lead by Shounakji who were performing a 1000 year yajna for the benefit of mankind. Shounakaji and others now ask Suta Puranikji an important question. "When a man has a desire, how can he fulfill that ethically sound desire? By worshipping whom, by what vrita, or tapas? Please let us know.

Sutaji was pleased to know that this question they asked, was for the benefit of the mankind and not for their personal benefit, for, they had abandoned their homes and all desires. Sutaji said " this question was also asked by Devarshi Naradaji once to Lord Narayana Himself; Let me tell you that story.
Once Naradaji was traveling all over the worlds and finally came to Bhuloka, where he found almost everyone was suffering one or the other misery on account of their past Karmas and were not knowing how to extricate themselves from their untold miseries which were multiplying everyday on account of their ignorance. Being a Satjana his heart felt their agonies and immediately he reached Vaikunta, to Lord Narayana to find the right answer for getting the people out of their miseries. But when he sees the Lord, being a great devotee of the Lord, he forgets his purpose and starts praising the Lord. The Lord Narayana smiles at him and asks the purpose of his visit, knowing that normally Naradaji does not visit Him without a purpose. Naradaji tells Him what he saw and requests Him a panacea for all such miseries. The Lord is
now happy at this question of Naradaji because of Naradajiâ€™s intention of benefiting the world by seeking the right answer. The Lord said: Yes, there is a vrita called Sri Satyanarayana vrita which is not known to the inhabitants of the Bhuloka.
This is a secret and yet since your interest is the benefit of the mankind, I shall narrate to you this vrata. This can be performed by anyone (anyone means it does not need an expert or a priest to worship the Lord - ANYONE of any caste, community, creed can worship the Lord directly) and very easily. One who does this, will get all the benefits and the pleasures of this world and will eventually get Moksha too. Now Narada wants to know more details of this vrita. The Lord says, this can be done any day, in the evening. Gather friends and relatives and perform this vrita with faith and devotion. The night should be spent in Bhajans and praise of the Lord. All those attending Pooja should be given food and respect. Thus the performer will get all his wishes fulfilled.

Sri Sri Ananta Veera Venkata Rama Satya Narayanaya Swami Namoh Namoh!!
