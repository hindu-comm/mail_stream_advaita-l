Dear Members,
                                By His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. This was the Dalai Lamaâ€™s advice at the dawn of this new millennium. It is nice reading, and short. All it takes is a few seconds to read and think over. So enjoy! But do not keep this message to yourself; share it! You will get a very pleasant surprise. This is true for all, of whatever religious belief, and even if you are not superstitious. Faith.
