The correct perspective is that all-pervading formless Ishvara alone is worshipped but by taking the help of forms. We don't worship idols - we worship Ishvara.

praNAms Sri Raghava prabhuji
Hare Krishna

If the above is the 'correct' vedAntic vision, then Sri Sudhanshu shekar prabhuji had a very valid point in arguing the concepts like 'change' and 'changeless'.  Can we say : vibhuti-s attributed to brahman is kevala avidyAkalpita just for the sake of teaching the ultimate nirvikAri brahman??  In all probability the answer is Yes, as there is no jagat at the very first place to say anything about its creator, sustainer and destroyer.  So, as a result, the hiraNya garbha, virAt purusha, trimurthy etc. etc. all are avidyA kalpita and kevala bhrama then only advaita's paramArtha satya can be upheld intact.  Correct me if I said anything wrong.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
