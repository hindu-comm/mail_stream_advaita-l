Very nicely stated. ajaayamaano bahudhaa vijaayate  says that all forms are
Brahman's forms. And they are all Its Vibhutis. Shankara has said that all
vibhutis of Brahman are non-different from It. And this non-difference
obtains in the state of ignorance too. In BSB 2.1.14 Shankara says:

न च विशेषदर्शनमात्रेण वस्त्वन्यत्वं भवति ; न हि देवदत्तः सङ्कोचितहस्तपादः
 प्रसारितहस्तपादश्च विशेषेण दृश्यमानोऽपि वस्त्वन्यत्वं गच्छति, स एवेति
प्रत्यभिज्ञानात् ;

Just because a difference is perceived across states, there cannot be
asserted a difference between the two entities. X, with limbs folded does
not become different from himself with limbs stretched as the recognition
'he alone is this' is had.

Similarly, in every form in creation, the recognition sat, chit etc. are
seen and the identity is thus established with Brahman.
