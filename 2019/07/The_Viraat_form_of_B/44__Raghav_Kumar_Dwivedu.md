Thank you for that post.
That's the amazing vision of Ishvara who can be worshipped in different
ways starting with the exalted celestial forms like Shiva etc., down to
chisels and axes which too are valid as locii for worship. (As in the
aayudha Pooja during the autumn festival  for example.) This is something
about Hinduism which is wrongly understood, perhaps even deliberately
misrepresented, as 'idolatry' and 'heathen' methods of worship. The correct
perspective is that all-pervading formless Ishvara alone is worshipped but
by taking the help of forms. We don't worship idols - we worship Ishvara.
This is so obvious to people who have connexion with the Vedic vision but
seems incomprehensible to those indoctrinated by the historical belief
systems.
