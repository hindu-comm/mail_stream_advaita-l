Bhaskar ji, you have said the correct view. Since we, in ajnana, see a
jagat of objects, names, forms, and are bound by raaga and dvesha, the
shaastra comes in to 'validate' the jagat by 'correcting' our view of the
jagat. In the process, it posits, as a necessary step, the 'creation of
jagat by a conscious, chetana, entity called Ishwara/Brahman, the sequence
of creation as 'Ishwara > Hiranyagarbha > Viraat.'  By doing this, the
shaastra 'divinises' the entire jagat experience.  He is a true follower of
sanatana dharma who accepts this 'shaastra drishti' of the jagat. When he
commits himself to adhere to the shaastra, he is shown the way of evolving
into realizing he is indeed that chaitinyam from whom this jagat
emerges/stays/resolves.  In this process the introducing and later
withdrawal of the concepts of Ishwara, hiranyagarbha and Viraat happen. The
Mandukya Upanishad is the basis for this. The pre-seventh mantras are the
adhyaropa part and the seventh mantra is the apavaada part for the triad of
Ishwara, hiranyagarbha and viraat. Within this scheme is present the wide
range of forms that Brahman takes for upaasana....saadhkaanugrahaartham as
the Bhashya has said.

Thus, there is no place for any real change, vikara, in Brahman.

warm regards
