Swami Vidyaranya's statements are supported by ancient texts like the
Parashara Dharma Samhita:

The Trimurti-s appear and disappear in every kalpa  - The Parasara Dharma
Samhita

The Parasara Smriti, a dharmashastra work, is an ancient one.  It says that
the Trimurtis have origination and disappearance in each creation cycle.
This is in perfect agreement with the Atharvashikha Upanishad which says:
brahmaviShNurudrendrAste samprasUyante..[Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra and Indra
are born..]

Sayanacharya (Madhavacharya) has commented on this text elaborately and the
same is available in multiple volumes.

A post on the above topic is available for download here:

Thus, the Trimurti-s belonging to creation is authentic.

Also the Vishnu Purana too says that the Trimurti-s are vibhuti-s of
Brahman.

Vishnu is also a vibhuti of Brahman – Vishnupuranam
In Vedanta, Brahman is the jagatkaaranam. Even though in the ultimate
analysis since the jagat is not there at all, yet, in order to guide us to
the knowledge of Brahman, the Veda adopts the method of first positing
Brahman as the cause of creation (sustenance and destruction) of the world
and then shows us Brahman as completely bereft of the jagat. In the sequel
are the verses that teach how the creator, sustainer and destroyer are all
Brahman’s vibhutis. Thus, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are all taught here as
the vibhutis of Brahman.
