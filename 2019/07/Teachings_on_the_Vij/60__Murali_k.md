Namaste,

Maha Sannidhanam is quoted as saying that ' one should perform Noble deeds
as enjoined in the shasthras'.

Can anyone here point out any books in English which contain these shastras
for daily conduct for a follower of Sanatana Dharma?

Thanks,
Murali

PS: Thanks for posting these nuggets.
