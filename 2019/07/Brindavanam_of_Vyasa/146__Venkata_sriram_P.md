Dear Srinath ji,

.................
The miscreants has demolished the visible BrindAvana of Sri Vyasarajaru
....................

There is a speciality with the visible brindavana also.  It is a historical monument
where there is a panel displaying  the 'paTTabhi-rama" flanked by shri vyasaraya
& lakshmana on either side.  

The construction has started today but alas ! the legacy of old monument is gone 

rgs,
sriram
