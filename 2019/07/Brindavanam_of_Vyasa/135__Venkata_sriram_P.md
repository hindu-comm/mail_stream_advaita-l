 I know Subbu-ji...but this is not the hour to fight & discuss supremacy of advaita over dvaita or vice versa....

We are hindus .....and we can't sit and stare when somebody is desecrating our temples and brindavanas ....

Namaste,

A very disturbing news. Pls sign the petition

https://www.change.org/p/karnataka-government-justice-for-vyasaraya-mutt-vrundvana-destroyed-by-thieves-should-be-arrested-and-punished

it is disturbing indeed. As of now the thinking is that this is an act of robbers as 'treasure hunters.'
I have signed the petition.
For those who may not know, Sri Vyasa Tirtha's 'Nyayamruta', a critique on Advaita evoked the Advaitasiddhi from Sri Madhusudana Saraswati.
