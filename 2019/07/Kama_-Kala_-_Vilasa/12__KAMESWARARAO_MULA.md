Dear members,            Sri Chakram can be defined as in simple terms:
Bindu Trikona Vasukona Dasarayugma Manvasra Nagadala Samyuta Shodasaram Vrutta Tryam Cha Dharani Sadhana Trayam Cha Sri Chakrameta duditam Paradevatayaha 

Verse 2
Sa Jayati Saktiradya nijasukhamayani Rupamakara
Bhavicaracarabijam Sivarupavimassanimaladarsah 

She is the Primoridal Sakti (Mantri swarupini) who moves in all moving &   motionless things and here true nature is eternal limitless bliss. 

Brahadaranyaka says rest of the people enjoys only a fragment of the Bliss. It further explains that all are arises from the drops of ‘amrita’ of the Ocean Brahmman –Bliss.

Agama Sastra says that the supreme power who is in the form of the universe (Viswarupini)  with her impulse created sphuratta then charka, Thus she is moving & motionless in the heart (Hridaya bija) just the the existence of the great tree is from the seed.

It is impossible for Parameswara to create without shakti and he can’t move an inch without her (Ref: Shakracharya’s soundarya lahari’s first sloka) and he could able to become Jagad Guru with her shakti only other wise siva is simply the sava i.e Corpse (dead body). Shakti is the pure mirror in which siva experiences himself.

Punayananda concludes in this sloka by saying that the world was created by a combination of Parameswara & shakti, as without devi there is no Eswara & vice versa hold good. It is simple like this that there is no difference between moon & moon beam.

On the occasion of Sri Kshetra Puri Jagannadha Radha Yatra – (Ashada Shukla Dwitiya)


Sri Guru Padaravindarpana Mastu
