M. Venkayya Naiduguru who is the chief-guest. It was ann excellent programme and I could able to collect few books and some adi-shankara's CD's also. Thanks to Bhaskar from Vednata Bharathi for reserving my seat in the function. My sincere regards to you ininforming the activity as I was in delhi.
Namaste
It is heartening to note that you were present at the event.
If there are nocopy right issues, I can share a copy of that book to any one through personal e-mail ID.
I am not sure about this. Let's await the opinion of Vedanta Bharati.
