The story in the Kenopanishat that depicts the appearance of an effulgence,
Yaksha, and the gods (deva-s) trying in vain to know / identify the Yaksha
is well known. A variation of this story is found in the Shatarudra samhita
of the Shiva Maha Puranam:

The above story in the Puranam identifies Yaksha as one of the many
incarnation of Lord Shiva.

It is significant that in the Upanishad bhashyam Shankara, while commenting
on Uma has said 'she is the consort of the Omniscient Ishwara', sarvajna
Ishwara.

The Suta samhita (Skanda Purana) rendering of the Kenopanishat too
identifies the Yaksha as Lord Shiva.
