Namaste,

Today is the happiest day and experiencing the happiest moments in my life.

My voice is choked with emotion and kudos to the devotion showed by 
all the madhva yatis who fasted without taking a single drop of water till the mission
was accomplished.  

Within a span of 32 hours, the brindavana is re-built ...yes..this is the spirit of hindus and 
when all get united, nothing can stop us .

यतो धर्मः ततो जयः
