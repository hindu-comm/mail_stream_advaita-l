A taste of Karnataka Iyengar Tamil along with a sublime message of Goal of
Life

' கர்னாடக ஐயங்கார் தமிழ்' - பக்தி அமுது

ಕರ್ಣಾಟಕ ಐಯಂಗಾರ್ ತಮಿಳು - ಭಕ್ತಿ ರಸದೌತಣ

In this video, Sri Kotur Sampath, hailing from a Srivaishnava family,
through a delightful dialogue, in the famous Iyengar Tamil of Karnataka,
conveys a beautiful message that summarizes the Srivaishnava philosophy. He
has made several videos, all of them centering round the lofty message of
life. He adds a lot of cultural tidbits into his dialogues that mirror the
traditions of the Iyengar lifestyle. Very enjoyable are his videos, by all
Tamil knowing people.
