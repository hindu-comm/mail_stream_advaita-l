Hari Om,

//What life circumstances brought you to the quest for liberation?//

The constant fear of loss of dear ones.

//And what do you find your biggest challenge with that quest is?//

There is no challenge. Everything is welcome.
Obstacle/pleasure/scholarship/lack of understanding -- everything is
welcome and I don't think anything as challenge. At the background, the
verse from Ashtavakra Gita keeps resonating -- अयमेव हि ते बन्ध: समाधिम्
अनुतिष्ठति।

Regards.
Sudhanshu.
