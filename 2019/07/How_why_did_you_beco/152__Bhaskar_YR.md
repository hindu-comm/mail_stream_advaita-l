What life circumstances brought you to the quest for liberation?

>  by seeing the niraNtara sAvu-nOvu...but wait!! We the loukika-s do get vairAgya whenever we hear / see  about suffering / death of our kith & kin...but it is obviously kshaNika sometimes it called smAshANa vairAgya.  During these gloomy periods, the vedAnti in us at his full swing and throws the suggestion " why do you need all these, why you are attached so much to your wife, kids, position, money etc.  there is nothing permanent in this world, the life is momentary like bubble on the water,  strive for the ultimate and eternal peace and happiness where there is not even an iota of duHkha.  Etc.  But once you come out of that atmosphere 'successfully' you will again lost yourself in mAyA prapancha / bhava sAgara.  Only viveki-s with their pUrva saMskAra would get the mumukshatva for the liberation, we the ordinary materialists have the tendency, 'chalega', let us see after retirement, after getting rid of all responsibilities etc.  A self-deceiving consolation without realizing that that day never come in our lives ðŸ˜Š   

And what do you find your biggest challenge with that quest is?

> A sweet bandhana / bondage ðŸ˜Š  samsara ghOra gahana Jagadeesha Raksha we do pray but despite knowing that we are going to suffer due to this attachment,  we still enjoy the swimming in samsara saagara, though we are the victims of  this vicious circle (visha vartula of samsara) we donot want to come out of it...that is called avidyA.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
