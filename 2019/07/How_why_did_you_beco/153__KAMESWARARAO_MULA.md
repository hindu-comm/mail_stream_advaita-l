Bhaskar Ji:         I am sure for That day will definitely comes in our lives with realisation whether our self is deceived or not , how it matters?To make this statement , I have many bitter experiences of my own personal life and I mention couple of incidents to discuss.
You mentions about kshanakala smashana Vairagya: When I was about 8-9 yrs old age, I don't remember exactly, but I recalls the incident. I am witness for the death of big personality of my village whose body was kept in front of his house until evening waiting for his elder son's arrival. Being the kid, I was just sitting along with all the people of that village just few feet away from that persons pardhiva sarira. In those times, there will be a big radio at the Grama Panchayati office which was in operational and it kept on. The messages/programmes coming out of that radio, the many sorrowful crying of the relatives of that persons along with murmuring about the persons materialistic wealth have entered into my ears to think deeper about the death process or realise the objectives of respective lives. The person who died on that day was of 95 yrs old, a well known vaidiki pandit of that village having four sons & two daughters along with wife survived at that time. I used to listen his excellent enchanting melodic veda swara, his ghana patha several years in that village. He lived his life upto the full extent as a bhoghi and spent fully of the materialistic wealth which he inherited from his father. His father was another great personality who performed Agni chayanam (a type of soma yaga) and did pasu bandhanam to impress the varunadi' gods for the timely rains which was told to me several times by the elders.
I could able to see the passing of a white light in the form of a 7-9 feet long light loop (may be like a allavuddin fakir called as Jin) and witnessed all his funeral process except going to the samshan. Although science doesn't allows us to believe these concepts, but it was true that , there is no single sign of unhealthiness in him or even his body was not folded an inch. Everyone in that village was rumoured that he was made to death by doing 'Kritya'/ black magic as no one can dare to face him out of his extraordinary vedic power. This incident always kepts a fire in me to think deep aspects about the self-realisation process and I have never gone to the burial grounds after that onwards until now as I can't face those incidents.
The other personal incident was of my grand father's death infront of his elders son (my mama) which make always open my eyes in permanent vairagya thought process although exists physically..
Only viveki-s with their pUrva saMskAra would get the mumukshatva for the liberation, we the ordinary materialists have the tendency, 'chalega', let us see after retirement, after getting rid of all responsibilities etc.

Weshouldn't adopt the 'Chlega' attitude and who bothers about theexistence of the persons real nature after the retirement/ or death. As you said nicely, the Purva Janma Samskara will only give the path for the liberation for the mumukshu.

What life circumstances brought you to the quest for liberation?

And what do you find your biggest challenge with that quest is?

> A sweet bandhana / bondage ðŸ˜Š samsara ghOra gahana Jagadeesha Raksha we do pray but despite knowing that we are going to suffer due to this attachment, we still enjoy the swimming in samsara saagara, though we are the victims of this vicious circle (visha vartula of samsara) we donot want to come out of it...that is called avidyA. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
