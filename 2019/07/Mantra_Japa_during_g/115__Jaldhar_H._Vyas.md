I had mentioned some stotras etc. which are recited during grahanakala. (I 
personally bathe change clothes and recite Adityahrdayam and Narayana 
Kavacha.) Ganapati atharvashirasa is also one of them.  But in general, I 
still maintain japa, particularly of Veda mantras should not be done. 
Perhaps as Shri Subrahmaniam suggests it is a matter of deshachara but 
I'll see if I can find some shastra pramana about it.
