Dear sir,
Probably during Surya Grahanam ( solar eclipse)Japas can be made as there is no mention about Lunar eclipse in the Veda quote.

Since there is mention about the auspiciousness of thejapan in suryagrahana kala, I think it will be applicable to chandraGrahanam also.How ever, suryagarahana kalajapam is more auspicious &powerful which can quickly leads to siddhi.
Karthikmentions scientific explanation of Swami Sivananda nicely whether Rahu or Ketu swallows sun or moon, there is an obstacle for some time for thenormal functions of the natures eyes, i.e sun & moon and during those periods the lights are notnormal as it used to be, there will be definetlyavouch and Intensejapa will surely leads to Mantra siddhi during that time.
Astronomically speaking, when the sun, the moon and the earth are all in
line, with the moon or the earth at the centre, a solar or lunar eclipse
takes place respectively.
It seems westerners also have orthodox views for Graham Kala and I would like to see any of our western members of the forum for their religious views during the Grahanakala periods.

It can be scientifically explained by thee fact that,Due to the inactive movement of the planets during grahana kala, there will be no obstacles in reaching the god/godesees through the mantra shakti as their powers were embedded in the mantra. Sruti says the mantra is the subtle form of the god's power. I also learnt that " Devam i.e God is Mantradhinam which indeed is Brahmmanadihnam". It is Brahmman who can reveal the mantra to the needy by the perfect judgement/testing.
> My grand father often used to say me that : The Gnapanti mantra is to be done during the 'Surya Graham' & Panchadasi or any other mother goddess mantra should be performed during Chandra Graham and any other mantra's also can be done as Japa's during the Graham Kala times which could give Mantra Siddhi in shorter time as I have seen many doing like this in the Varansi Ghats during the Graham Periods since several years.
