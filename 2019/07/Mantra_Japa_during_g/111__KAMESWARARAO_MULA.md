Clarification for Regarding the Changing of Jenev (Jandhyam) after Grahana:
I was told several times to change the Jenev immediately i.e next day after the Grahanam day was over. It seems we can't perform the next days sandhya i.e surya arghya pradhan without changing the jeneve as per our customs.
Day before yesterday, i called my home and Said " Can we change the jeneve on Sravana pournami (Jandhyala pournami), this year Aug 15 as the date is ver nearer & I thought why to do two changes in shorter time intervels, I was told it is not possible, I need to change it immediately in a day or two(with out tuesday/saturday) to perform the next days regular sandhya. When I asked for some sastra praam, they don't have answer except with some explanation for the 'asoucha for Jeneve' similar to aparakamra or going to burial ground.
Learned members, pls comment on your customs for changing the genev after the grahanakal , what is prescribed in sastra about this?what is to be followed ? pls advice methodologically.
I also want to know where the sastra mentioned for the procedure to change the genev & its methods/

No. Grahanakala is an inauspicious time for japa

I don't agree this as I havereference to contradict this statement.Ganapathi atharvana sirsha says that :Suuryagrahe-Mahaa-Nadyaam Pratimaa-Sannidhau Vaa Japtvaa Siddha-Mantro Bhavati.


There was an announcement that all shrines in Sringeri will be kept open during the Grahana for people to come there and do japa, etc. Either Gayatri (for those it has been given) or other japa-s that people have received can be performed during Grahana. Maybe there is a difference of opinion across various parts of the country. Desha aachaara.

I also learnt from Guru's that the 'Japa' made during theGraham kala ismulti folded times of theactual one which leads to siddhi. It can bescientifically explained by thee fact that,Due to the inactive movement of the planets during grahana kala, there will be no obstacles in reaching the god/godesees through themantra shakti astheir powers wereembedded in the mantra. Sruti says the mantra is the subtle form of the god's power. I also learnt that " Devam i.e God is Mantradhinam which indeed is Brahmmanadihnam". It is Brahmman who can reveal the mantra to the needy by the perfect judgement/testing.
My grand father often used to say me that : The Gnapanti mantra is to be done during the 'SuryaGraham' & Panchadasi or any other mothergoddess mantra should be performedduring ChandraGraham and any other mantra'salso can be done as Japa's during theGraham Kala times which could giveMantra Siddhi in shorter time as I have seen many doing like this in the Varansi Ghats during theGraham Periodssince several years.
