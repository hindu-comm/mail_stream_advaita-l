General Practice of the many temples in India except few is that they will be closed during the Grahana Kala due to the fact that the sanctum may get the negative energy  or Malina of the temple could be possible and every one including the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) will do the suddhi Karan of the whole temple after the grahana period is over.

Ishwara is nitya shuddha buddha mukta svarUpa and he is sakala graha bala, (sakala graha bala neene sarasijAksha says puraNdara dAsaru)  how can he become dirty when the doors are opened and how can he be clean during grahaNa  if the 'garbha gudi' doors are  closed !! ??  Does this mean IshwarAstitva /  sAnidhya possible / restricted only within the sanctum sanctorum ??  Though we agree that within the garbha gudi there will be 'special presence / vibrations' of Ishwara, how grahaNa can bring malinatvaM to the saMpUrNa Pavitra deity / Ishwara??   Donâ€™t we have to see all these from vedAnta perspective as well ?? Or should we simply (or blindly) go by traditional practices without raising any issues ??  Any shAstrAdhAra with regard to Ishwara's malinatvaM due to grahaNa in AgamAdi shAstra ?? If yes,  please share.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
