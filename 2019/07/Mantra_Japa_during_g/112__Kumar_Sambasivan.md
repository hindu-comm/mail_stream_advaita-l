Namaskaram

I have been a silent follower imbibing the immense knowledge spread by this noble group. Since I recently read through, thought of sharing the aspect on "sacred thread".

Achaarendu states as follows on Yagnopavita

	VAmahaste Vyatite Tu Tath TwakthA DhArayeth Navam  1
	Patitam Truthitam VApi Brahmasutram YadA Bhaveth Nutanam DhArayedhvipraha SnAtvA Sankalpa Purvakam  2
	Malamutre Twajedh Vipra Vismritaiyvopavitadhruk Upavitam Taduthsrijya DadhyA Danyannavam TadhA  3

Meaning

If the Yajnopavita slips from shoulder and falls below the level of left hand, 
if some of the threads are torn,
if one forgets to place it on ear during soucha etc, then it should be replaced.

It further states that if an untouchable touches it then also it should be changed.

It is a practice to change the yagnopavita on the following occasions

Once in a year on the day of Upakarma;
	Whenever there is birth/death in the family, after completion of the stipulated period of asoucha;
	Whenever one visits the Cremation Ground or touches a Corpse;
	Whenever one happen to touch a woman during menstruation;
	Whenever one attends 10th day ceremony and gives Dharmodaka.

Best Regards

Kumar

> Day before yesterday, i called my home and Said " Can we change the jeneve on Sravana pournami (Jandhyala pournami), this year Aug 15 as the date is ver nearer & I thought why to do two changes in shorter time intervels,  I was told it is not possible, I need to change it immediately in a day or two(with out tuesday/saturday) to perform the next days regular sandhya. When I asked for some sastra praam, they don't have answer except with some explanation for the 'asoucha for Jeneve' similar to aparakamra or going to burial ground.

Maybe there is a difference of opinion across various parts of the country. Desha aachaara.

> I also learnt from Guru's that the 'Japa' made during the Graham kala is multi folded times of the actual one which leads to siddhi. It can be scientifically explained by thee fact that,Due to the inactive movement of the planets during grahana kala, there will be no obstacles in reaching the god/godesees through the mantra shakti as their powers were embedded in the mantra. Sruti says the mantra is the subtle form of the god's power. I also learnt that  " Devam i.e God is Mantradhinam which indeed is Brahmmanadihnam". It is Brahmman who can reveal the mantra to the needy by the perfect judgement/testing.
> My grand father often used to say me that : The Gnapanti mantra is to be done during the 'Surya Graham' & Panchadasi or any other mother goddess mantra should be performed during Chandra Graham and any other mantra's also can be done as Japa's during the Graham Kala times which could give Mantra Siddhi in shorter time as I have seen many doing like this in the Varansi Ghats during the Graham Periods since several years.
