praNAms Sri Venkataraghavan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Of course Ishvara does not get dirty during grahaNa or ashoucha - यत्र यदध्यासः, तत्कृतेन दोषेण गुणेन वा अणुमात्रेणापि स न सम्बध्यते।

Hence, the worship of Ishvara in a temple, the rules around grahaNa, ashoucham, etc are meant to ensure the well being of the jIva, not to protect Ishvara, who is beyond good and evil, purity and impurity.


Ø     Thanks for the clarification.  Yes, all these rituals, vidhi-nishedha etc. prescribed only for AtmOnnati of the jeeva.  Bringing  Ishwara / deva etc. and influence of grahaNa on them is just to bring the ‘fear factor in jeeva.  See, Ishwara himself will get dirty, what to say about tiny soul like you??  So be careful and follow all the rituals and observe all the injunctions & prohibitions meticulously to save yourself from grahaNa chAya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
