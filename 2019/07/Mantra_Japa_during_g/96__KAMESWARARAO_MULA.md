No. Grahanakala is an inauspicious time for japa

I don't agree this as I havereference to contradict this statement.Ganapathi atharvana sirsha says that :Suuryagrahe-Mahaa-Nadyaam Pratimaa-Sannidhau Vaa Japtvaa Siddha-Mantro Bhavati.
I also learnt from Guru's that the 'Japa' made during theGraham kala ismulti folded times of theactual one which leads to siddhi. It can bescientifically explained by thee fact that,Due to the inactive movement of the planets during grahana kala, there will be no obstacles in reaching the god/godesees through themantra shakti astheir powers wereembedded in the mantra. Sruti says the mantra is the subtle form of the god's power. I also learnt that " Devam i.e God is Mantradhinam which indeed is Brahmmanadihnam". It is Brahmman who can reveal the mantra to the needy by the perfect judgement/testing.
My grand father often used to say me that : The Gnapanti mantra is to be done during the 'SuryaGraham' & Panchadasi or any other mothergoddess mantra should be performedduring ChandraGraham and any other mantra'salso can be done as Japa's during theGraham Kala times which could giveMantra Siddhi in shorter time as I have seen many doing like this in the Varansi Ghats during theGraham Periodssince several years.

No. Grahanakala is an inauspicious time for japa, vedadhyana, 
shastradhyana etc. But stotras such as Adityahrdaya, Hanuman Chalisa, or 
kavacha of ones ishtadevata are recommended.
