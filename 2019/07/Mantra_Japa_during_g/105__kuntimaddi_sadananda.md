PraNAms
This reminds me of a conversation between a drunkard and a priest.
The drunkard asked the priest -Sir, Can I drink while praying?The priest said - No. You should not drink while praying. You should devote fully, with your body, mind, and intellect while praying.
The drunkard thought for a while and changed his question. 'Sir, Can I pray while drinking?
The priest responded - Of course son, you can pray any time. God listens to all prayers all the time.

 Namaste Bhaskar ji,

Of course Ishvara does not get dirty during grahaNa or ashoucha

However, these rules are prescribed not for Ishvara, but keeping in mind
the ajnAni jIva-s who do not yet see Him in places of impurity, like ‡§∂‡•Å‡§®,
‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§™‡§æ‡§ï, etc, or sometimes, even in evil men - He is, after all, a

The mind and senses of the jIva are the organs with which he interacts with
the world, and for this reason, they are often described as the consumers
of shabda, sparsha, rUpa, etc. When those sense objects are ritualistically
unclean things, that impurity clings to the sense organs which feed upon
them, and through dehAtma abhimAna, to the jIva. As long as he is a sharIra
abhimAni, the impurities of the body mind complex are the jIva-s and will
cause him trouble.

Hence, the worship of Ishvara in a temple, the rules around grahaNa,
ashoucham, etc are meant to ensure the well being of the jIva, not to
protect Ishvara, who is beyond good and evil, purity and impurity.

Venkatraghavan
