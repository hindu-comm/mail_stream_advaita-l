Namaste,
The next post in the series is available here:
http://www.advaitasiddhi.com/blog/pariccheda-1-bhavibadhopapatti

A personal favourite, it contains some important discussions such as the
role played by visheShaNa and upalakshaNa in the context of niShprakAraka
jnAna, the difference between AkAra and prakAra in cognitions etc.

Kind regards,
Venkatraghavan
