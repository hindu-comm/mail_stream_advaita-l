Namaste,

Swamiji loved to roam like avadhuta and Shri Sadasiva Brahmendra was His chosen ideal.  
He was so indrawn and introvert that moving out of sringeri and touring was 
very painful for Him.   But, keeping in view of 'loka-sangraha', He had to 
do all these....

सदात्मध्याननिरतं विषयेभ्यः पराङ्‍मुखम् । 
नौमि शास्त्रेषु निष्णातं चन्द्रशेखरभारतीम् ।।

rgs,
sriram
