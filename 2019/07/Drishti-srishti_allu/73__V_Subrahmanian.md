Namaste

While it is true that the Turiya is not what is meant in the sushupti
state, the bhashya highlights the absence of experience of duality in that
state as the yukti to show that dvaita, naanaatva, is not real,
svaabhaavika. That which exists in one instance, state, and is absent in
another, cannot be held to be satya. This yukti, is essential in manana.
For tattva darshana, however, one has to realize that the sushupti state is
not Turiya since the seed, beeja. for naanaatva is present in sushupti. We
have also to remember that dvaita constitutes bondage, experience of
samsara, only in its vyakta avasthaa.  In the avyakta avasthaa, dvaita does
not cause samsara anubhava. It is in this light that the stated two mantras
are seen by the Bhashyakara.
