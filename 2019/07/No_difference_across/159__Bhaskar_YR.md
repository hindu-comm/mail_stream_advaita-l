Hare Krishna

[The Upanishad goes on to say that One alone became three, eight, eleven, twelve, infinite forms. All tattvas like indriya, etc. are Brahman alone.]

>  Yes, that is the reason all other shruti / smruti texts say sarvaM khalvidaM brahma, satyanchaanrutancha satyamabhavat yadidaM kiMcha, idaM sarvaM yadayamAtmA, brahmaivedaM amrutaM purastAt, brahmArpaNam, brahma haviH, yetasmAjjAyate prANah, manaH sarva indriyANi cha, Atman is left, right, top, botton, inside, outside etc.  Does this mean brahman has the svagata bheda like this??  It is not so, clarifies bhAshyakAra in bruhadAraNyaka bhAshya keeping the upAdhi drushti and svarUpa drushti.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
