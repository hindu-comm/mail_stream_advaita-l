Namaste
My pranams to HH Swami Paramananda Bharati ji. Sri Swamiji embodied
vairagyam and shAstra adhyapanaM. He was very passionate in advocating
Shankara bhAShya study. And his responses in the language of science to
some of the contemporary pUrvapakSas about Consciousness coming from
reductionistic Science, were quite scholarly and thought-provoking. There
are YouTube videos of his seminars in IISc Bangalore. Swamiji himself in
pUrvaashrama had worked in IIT Madras in the field of thermodynamics. (If
my memory serves me right.)

One interesting aspect of his approach was to question panchikaraNam as
usually understood. He was also not in favour of the dRShTi-sRShTi
prakriyas.

Om
Raghav
