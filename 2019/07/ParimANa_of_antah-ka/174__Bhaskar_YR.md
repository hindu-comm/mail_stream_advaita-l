Hari Om,

What is held to be the parimANa of antah-karaNa in advaita siddhAnta? From Brahma Sutra BhAshya 2.3.19-33, it appears that the same is stated to be aNu parimANa.

Question arises as to how can antah-karaNa with aNu parimANa have vritti like ghatAkAra-vritti etc?

>  Sorry not able to understand your question here.  Do you mean to say, since antaHkaraNa is small (aNu) how can it have vrutti bigger than it??  Or am I missing something here??  By the way, here parimANa I reckon denotes only its subtility not about its  size hence antaHkaraNa is called sUkshma shareera.  For that matter purusha is angushTa mAtra says taittireeya mahAnArAyaNa, it does not anyway mean purusha is dwarf or it is its actual size , he is aNu as well mahAn, aNoraNeeyAn mahatO maheeyAn.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
