Namaste,

I think Karapatri-ji refuted this work and wrote a book to counter this.  

Reading such books doesn't serve our purpose of search for Truth & Eternal Happiness. 

Arya Samajists are iconoclasts and doesn't believe in Ramayana, Mahabharata & 
Puranas.  Their's is 'anglicised veda'. Better to stay away from such notions.

rg,
sriram
