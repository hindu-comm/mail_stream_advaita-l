A Course on Vādaṥāstra (Theory and Practice of Debate)
Concept Note
Vāda is a a category in Indian Philosophy which involves theory and
practice of intellectual debates, dialogues and discussions. It is because
of vāda that cultures and civilizations have thrived and great intellectual
achievements could be made. Vāda promotes diversity and pluralism and
inculcates democratic values. No vāda is possible if there is only one
point of view, it always pre-requisites the other; and mostly promotes the
presence of many others. India’s History of Ideas and debates presents a
multi-linear view. Saṃvāda (dialogue, correspondence) and vivāda
(difference) are two faces of Vāda.
