The Karnataka Sanskrit University, Bengaluru,  has organized the above
event over several weeks at their auditorium.  Select episodes from the
five kaavya-s are to be rendered in tune and expounded in simple Sanskrit.
A sumptuous treat for rasika-s.

The sessions will be recorded and uploaded later.  One can view the Kannada
flyers in the link to 'view' this post below.
