I heard through someone that there is a certificate course on 'self-realization' as well from the kriya yOga foundation ( paramahaMsa yOgAnanda - Autobiography of a Yogi fame).  There are so many people, every year,  graduating from this institution having the certificate of self-realization.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
