The making of the Sudarshana Chakra

In the Padma Purana, Uttara Khanda, is the story of Jaalandhara. In this
context, there arises a need to quell the demon and a weapon is
manufactured. The weapon, the Sudarshana Chakra, is the outcome of the
shakti, lustre, of the Trimurtis and all the gods. It is symbolic in the
sense that to fight an aasura shakti, the daivi shakti combined is to be
employed:. The relevant pages from the purana are available in this short
file:
