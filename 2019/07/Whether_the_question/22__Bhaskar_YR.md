Master Sivananda says that :Nirakara, Nirguna, Nirvisesha, Nishkriya, are the negative attributes of Brahman.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Negative attributes??  I really doubt in what context this has been said by Sri sivAnanda.  bhAshyakAra somewhere says we have to take 'nirguNatva' of brahman as enshrined in shruti as 'first' preference though shruti talks about 'saguNatva' of brahman equally.  This has to be like that because shruti's ultimate teaching about parabrahman is nirguNa, nirAkAri, nirvishesha, nishkriya.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
