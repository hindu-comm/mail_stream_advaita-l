It is not appropriate to say that 'no understanding is possible about
Brahman' as the shruti asks us to get a perfect understanding of Brahman:
Brahma vit aapnoti param. Even the very first brahma sutra says: atha ato
brahma jijnaasaa.  For that the explanation is 'brahma jijnaasaa
kartavyaa'. Tad vijijnaasasva,   drashtavyah...etc. Only that Brahman
cannot be/should not be known as an object.

Thus, one should know Brahman as not a kaarya of anything and not a kaarana
of anything. In that process, first to know Brahman as jagatkaaranam is
tatastha lakshana. This adhyaropa is denied, apavada, when Brahman is
taught as 'apurvam anaparam.'
