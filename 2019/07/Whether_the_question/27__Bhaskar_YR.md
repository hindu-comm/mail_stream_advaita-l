In this post, I am simply questioning the permissibility of the question of "coming about" of world/jiva/change from changeless and nishkriya Brahman. I am not on the nature/reality of world/jiva or on the how of creation.

I am trying to convey that this question itself is impermissible in Advaita VedAnta because the question reflects some "understanding" of Brahman and thereby making Brahman an object of buddhi - which is against the premise of aprameyatva and avishayatva of Brahman. I wish the comments from learned members on this issue of permissibility of this question.

How about sUtra bhAshya 2-1-9 & 10â€¦..do you think bhAshyakAraâ€™s explanation not enough to clear this doubt??  If the mUlAchArya himself not capable then I doubt who else !!?? matsthAni sarvabhUtAni â€¦na cha matsthAni bhUtAni pasya me yOgamaishvaraMâ€¦says lord in Geeta.  And for your point with regard to brahmanâ€™s aprameyatva and avishayatva shAstra adopts sthulArundhati nyAya.  Hence manasaivAnudrashtavyaM neha nAnAsti kiMchana.  Yes, IMO, these questions are very much permissible and to the best extent possible  shAstra and Acharya answered them.  But question is how long we can â€˜enjoyâ€™ these questions within the permissible limits ðŸ˜Š BTW, I am not so learned,  so, prabhuji you can wait for more authentic answer from the saMpradAyavida-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
