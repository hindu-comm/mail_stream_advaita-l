"How can the world come about from nishkriya Brahman" ?

Dear SudhanshuJi,
                Master Sivananda says that :Nirakara, Nirguna, Nirvisesha, Nishkriya, are the negative attributes of Brahman.
More Details can be found in this Link as they were so nicely explained by Sivananda MahaRaj.

 Hari Om,

"How can the world come about from nishkriya Brahman" - is it a valid
question in Advaita VedAnta? The confusion arises because this process of
"coming about" - in whichever manner - must necessarily involve change
which will contradict the nishkriyatva and changelessness of Brahman.

So my doubt is - whether this question itself is permissible to be asked in
Advaita VedAnta. My point is that this question is impermissible.

Why?

Because when we ask this question, it implies that we have got certain
"idea" about Brahman. We are imputing the dharma of "nishkriyatva" and
"changelessness" to Brahman whereas Brahman is stated as nirdharmaka. When
Shruti uses the word nishkriya or satya for Brahman, then it is not state
satyatva or nishkriyatva as the dharma of Brahman, but as lakshana of
Brahman with at intent to withdraw our vision from kriyavaan and
asatya-vastu (which can pretty well be understood).

Therefore, the very question as to how of creation from Brahman should be
impermissible in Advaita VedAnta because without having "some
understanding" of Brahman, this question is not possible AND no
understanding is possible about Brahman.

I would appreciate the views of learned members here.

Regards,
Sudhanshu Shekhar.
