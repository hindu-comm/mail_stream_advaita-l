The idea of paramarthika is taught by the Veda itself. For example:

Brihadaranyaka Up. 4.5.15:

यत्र हि द्वैतमिव भवति तदितर इतरं पश्यति तदितर इतरं जिघ्रति तदितर इतरं रसयते
तदितर इतरमभिवदति तदितर इतरं शृणोति तदितर इतरं मनुते तदितर इतरं स्पृशति
तदितर इतरं विजानाति ..

यत्र त्वस्य सर्वमात्मैवाभूत्तत्केन कं पश्येत्तत्केन कं जिघ्रेत्तत्केन कं
रसयेत्तत्केन कमभिवदेत्तत्केन कं शृणुयात्तत्केन कं मन्वीत तत्केन कं
स्पृशेत्तत्केन कं विजानीयाद्येनेदं सर्वं विजानाति तं केन विजानीयात्स एष
नेति नेत्यात्मागृह्यो न गृह्यतेऽशीर्यो न हि शीर्यतेऽसङ्गो न हि सज्यतेऽसितो
न व्यथते न रिष्यति विज्ञातारमरे केन विजानीयादित्युक्तानुशासनासि
मैत्रेय्येतावदरे खल्वमृतत्वमिति होक्त्वा याज्ञवल्क्यो विजहार ॥ १५ ॥

Here, both the vyavaharika (in the first part) and paramarthika (in the
next part) have been clearly differentiated by the Upanishad itself.

Anityatva does not negate the validity.  For instance the pratyaksha
pramana is had from the eye, etc. jnanendriyas. The Veda admits that all
these are anitya and Atman alone is nitya. By that much the validity of the
pratyaksha is not invalidated in its domain.

This is answered in the earlier paragraph. For Advaitins Veda, Avidya,
etc.are sva-para-nirvaahaka. Like a medicine that enters the body, cures
the disease and itself gets extinguished.

If Dvaitins view the above shruti, etc. differently, that is not anything
to Advaitins.
