This is not correct. Allah Upanishad is found in Veda. If Svatah Pramanya
is accepted this Upanishad is also valid Veda only. But we know it cannot
be valid. Why? Because there is no Guru Sishya Parampara of teaching this
Upanishad from ancient time. There are no ancient Bhashyas for it and so
on. Therefore we conclude it is added recently by some person. It is
Pourusheya and not valid.
