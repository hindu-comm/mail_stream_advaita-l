Hi All,

We are all aware of Narayaniyam done by NARAYANA BHATTATHRI. It was written
by him to get himself healed from the disease he was suffering from.

It is described that he was cured from his disease after he finished
writing Narayaniyam. But still he was not fit for attaining Moksha. He was
longing for Moksha. Guruvayoor Krishna came in his dream and asked him to
goto Mukti Sthala in Kerala where SRIMATI DURGA DEVI resides. Krishna
requested him to go there and do UPASANA on AMBAL and then he will be able
to attain MOKSHA as she is the only giver of MOKSHA. It is described that
Bhattathri stayed at Mukti Sthala for his last 20 years singing songs on
AMBAL. One of his final compilations is SRIPADA SAPTHATHI - describing
DEVI's Paduka (feet). After he completed this work he attained MOKSHA by
DEVI's grace. It contains 70 verses describing all GODS acquire their power
by serving the feet of DEVI. Below is the PDF copy of that.
