A friend shared this in a whatsapp group:

Five Kilometers from my Home in Kerala is a Village called Mookuthala. This
is a Malayalification of the word Mukthisthala. Sri.Melpathur Narayana
Bhattathiripadu has spent long years in Guruvayur as a devotee of
Sri.Guruvayurappan. Legend has it that he suffered from depression and
Guruvayurappan came in a dream and instructed him to go to Muthisthala and
devote his prayers to the deity of that temple. Legend has it that he was
70 years old and hence he wrote 70 slokas dedicated to the Bhagavathi of
that temple. He passed away when he was 82 years or so. Importantly he was
completely cured of his depression by his devotion. Even now in Kerala
people do sit in Bhajana in Temples when they suffer in body or mind. And
many do get healing.🙏🙏

Mookuthala - Mukthisthala - Bhagavathi temple where Sri.Melpathur Narayana
Bhatthiripadu spend his his last severtal years.
