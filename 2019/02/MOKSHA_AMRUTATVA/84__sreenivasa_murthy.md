Dear readers,
Sri Shankara, in his commentary to mantra 2-2-5 of 
Mundaka writes thus:yataH amRtasya ESha sEtuH |EtadAtmajnAnam amRutasya amRutatvasya 
mOkShasya PrAptayE sEturiva sEtuH ||
In other words, Atmajnana is the way to moksha.Atman is here and now, because "I am" is HERE & NOW.
Sri Shankara says : AtmA hi nAma svarUpam ||Atman is one's own  svarUpa which is here and now.My revered Guru used to say: "where nAnu (me) is there there is tAnu (Atman) ".Is it not much beneficial to know Atma 
instead of knowing about Atma?Moksha is here and now.

With respectful namaskars,Sreeniasa Murthy
