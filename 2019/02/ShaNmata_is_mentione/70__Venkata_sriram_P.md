Namaste,

All the sangeeta trimurties were smArtAs and advaitins. Shyama Sastry & Dikshitar were 
srividyopAsakAs. 

Ironically, for Tyagabrahman, the sangeeta-pitAmaha Purandara Dasa was mAnasika-guru
and held him in high esteem. 

TTD is popularising now the dAsa-sAhitya and annamAchArya literature.

rgs,
sriram
