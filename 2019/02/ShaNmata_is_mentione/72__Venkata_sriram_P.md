Namaste,

His work 'prahlada bhakti vijayamu' is an outcome of his inspiration from dAsa-sampradAya. He reverentially remembers all acharyas of dAsa-sampradAya like Namadev, Tukaram and other hari-dasas.

Some of his kritis bear the style of Purandara Dasa like 'sogasuga mrudanga taalamu..." etc. He was very much influenced with 'nAma-siddhAnta' and shunned show, pomp, lifeless rituals, shastra-vAsana.

rg,
sriram
