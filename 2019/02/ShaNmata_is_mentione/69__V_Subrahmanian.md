'ShaNmata' is mentioned by Thyagaraja

The famous Pancharatna kriti of Thyagaraja, 'Endaro mahanubhaavulu..', in
one of its charaNams, mentions the term 'ShaNmata' with a prefix 'shiva
aadi'.  The meaning can be read in this site:
http://www.shivkumar.org/music/endaromahanubhavulu-new.htm

The six schools of devotional practice culminating in Para Brahman
realization are: Saivam, Saaktam, Vaishnavam, Sauram, GaaNaapatyam and
Kaumaaram.
It is significant that this term 'ShaNmatam' is found in a text that is not
related to Shankaracharya or Advaita. Thyagaraja, even though a great
devotee of Sri Rama, was not a bigoted follower. That he was of a very
broad vision is known from his many other compositions too. Here he says
that those are exalted men who are endowed with the knowledge of the core
scriptures including the Veda, Bhagavatam, Ramayana, Bh.Gita, etc. and the
paths of bhakti which are devoted to Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, Ganesha, Kumara
and Surya. In his vision, if someone is opposed to this view is not a
'mahaanubhaava'.

Charanam-9: These are the great men who have derived boundless happiness by
gathering the ocean of knowledge contained in Bhagvatam, Ramayana, Geeta,
Vedas, Shastras by pondering over the secrets of the six religions orders
under the class Sauram and Koumaram, by understanding the mind of the
countless devas, by living a full life through the joy derived from music
based on bhava, raga and laya.]

Thyagaraja's attitude is found reflected in a galaxy of persons of the
Sanatana Dharma. Madhusudana Saraswati's verse in the Bh.Gita 15th chapter
commentary:
शैवाः सौराश्च गाणेशा वैष्णवाः शक्तिपूजकाः। भवन्ति यन्मयाः सर्वे सोहमस्मि
परः शिवः।।3।

'I am that Supreme Śiva which is what the Śaivas, Sauras, Gāṇeśas,
Vaiśṇavas, Śāktas meditate upon.'

Annamācārya reflects in this song:

<http://karnatiklyrics.blogspot.in/2011/06/entha-matramuna.html>

//The Vaishnavas worship you with reverence as Vishnu. The Vedic
philosophers tell that you are the Supreme Consciousness. The Shaivas
believe that you are Śiva & the Kapalikas praise you as Adibhairava. The
Shakteyas consider you as the manifestation of the supreme power Shakti.
People chant your praise in a number of ways. Ignorant people assume that
you are insignificant.The wise recognize your infinite greatness.// [Iit is
noteworthy that Sri Annamācārya excludes the vaiṣṇavas from Vedāntins, just
as Śankara has excluded the Pāñcarātra/bhāgavata school from the Vedānta
darśana in the BSB:

koluthuru mimu vaishnavulu, koorimitho vishnudani palukuduru mimu
vaedaantulu, parabrahma anuchu

By ‘Vedāntins’ he obviously refers to Advaitins for they alone hold the
Supreme Reality to be ‘Brahman’ beyond all names and forms. Those who hold
the highest tattvam to be ‘Viṣṇu’ (the deity identified as Lakṣmipati,
etc.) are not vedantins as per this composer. None other than a true
Vedantin can compose a verse that gives that lofty message that finds
correspondence with Madhusudana and Pushpadanta and several unknown authors.

Pushpadanta, in his Shivamahimna stotram, for which Madhusudana Saraswati's
Hari-Harapara commentary is available, says:

त्रयी <http://www.ms.uky.edu/%7Esohum/sanskrit/mahimna/trayii.wma> साङ्ख्यं
योगः पशुपतिमतं वैष्णवमिति

प्रभिन्ने प्रस्थाने परमिदमदः पथ्यमिति च।

रुचीनां वैचित्र्यादृजुकुटिल नानापथजुषां

नृणामेको गम्यस्त्वमसि पयसामर्णव इव॥ ७॥
The different practices based on the three Vedas, SaMkhya, Yoga,
Pashupata-mata, VaishhNava-mata etc . are but different paths (to reach to
the Greatest Truth) and people on account of their different aptitude
choose from them whatever they think best and deserved to be accepted . But
as the sea is the final resting place for all types of streams , You are
the only reaching place  for all people whichever path,straight or zigzag,
they may accept .  (7)

The highly catholic view of Jayantha Bhatta, of the 9th Century, is very
commendable. His another work 'AagamaDambara', a drama, is also full of
such concepts. For the verse composed by him, in the era contemporaneous
with Shankara and prior to Ramanuja, see image in the post here:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/ZWhU0NzwZ-4/qr7INZ5nBQAJ

Thus, we have the idea of worshiping any deity of one's ishTa, preference,
and attaining the Supreme, enshrined in the scriptural lore. It has been
given expression to by innumerable Vedantins. Shankara's Prapanchasara is
one example.
