 Dear Sri Subramanian,
Sri Shankara defines mOkSha in one line :
 nityatvAt mOkshasya sAdhkasvarUpAvyatirEkAcca ||
Then,Where is the need to study such books like the one 
what you have recommended?Of what use is it to accumulate knowledge about mOkSha 
instead of attaining mOkSha as taught by Sri Shankara?
Is it not a waste of time and energy? 
Instead of devoting time and energy to study such 
voluminous book, is it not much better and profittable 
for a student of Vedanta to utilize the same amount of 
zeal, time and energy to devote for the supreme purpose 
of knowing one's true nature viz., AtmasvarUpa. 
Mere studying books will make one a matravit like Narada , 
never an Atmavit, because he will ever remain 
as a reader, as an entity.With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.

 Moksha KaanDa of Lakshmidhara’s (early 12th century CE) ‘Krtya Kalpataru’

The Moksha KANDa is one, the last, of the 14 volumes compiled by
Lashmidhara Bhatta in his Dharma Shaastra nibandhana. Like the AdhyAtma
paTala of the Apastamba Dharma sutras, but much larger in volume, the
Moksha KANDa is full of Advaitic concepts and has several parallels with
Shankaracharya’s bhashyas, which are shown in this selection. While the
entire Moksha kANDa is much larger, this selection aims at showing only
certain aspects pertaining to Advaita and concepts that are not opposed to
Advaita.

By studying this Moksha KANDa, it turned out that this book is easily
worthy of being prescribed as a study text in a Vedanta teaching
institution. A study of this very valuable text by mumukshus, under a
qualified Acharya, would also be of great benefit in Advaita sadhana.

The file, of about 60 pages, with many images, explanations, citations from
the Bhashya of Shankara, etc. is available here as a downloadable pdf:

Please share this file in other groups.
