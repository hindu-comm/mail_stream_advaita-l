Moksha KaanDa of Lakshmidhara’s (early 12th century CE) ‘Krtya Kalpataru’

The Moksha KANDa is one, the last, of the 14 volumes compiled by
Lashmidhara Bhatta in his Dharma Shaastra nibandhana. Like the AdhyAtma
paTala of the Apastamba Dharma sutras, but much larger in volume, the
Moksha KANDa is full of Advaitic concepts and has several parallels with
Shankaracharya’s bhashyas, which are shown in this selection. While the
entire Moksha kANDa is much larger, this selection aims at showing only
certain aspects pertaining to Advaita and concepts that are not opposed to
Advaita.

By studying this Moksha KANDa, it turned out that this book is easily
worthy of being prescribed as a study text in a Vedanta teaching
institution. A study of this very valuable text by mumukshus, under a
qualified Acharya, would also be of great benefit in Advaita sadhana.

The file, of about 60 pages, with many images, explanations, citations from
the Bhashya of Shankara, etc. is available here as a downloadable pdf:
