 Dear Sri Venkata Sriram,
Kindly refer to mantras 7-1-2 and 7-1-3 of Chandogya Upanishad where Narada declares that he is a mantravit only 
and not an Atmavit. 
I think this Narada of Chandogya Upanishad and 
Narada of the puranas are different persons.
What statement has been made by me is an 
extract from these mantras. 
It may please be noted that whatever has been 
stated by me in the postings of mine so far 
they have the support and pramana of Upanishads and 
Sri Shankara's commentaries only .
With respectful pranams,Sreenivasa Murthy

Need to be careful while making the sweeping statements like
above.

नारं परमात्मविषयकं ज्ञानं ददातीति नारदः - One who bestows the Supreme Knowledge is Sage Narada.

He is the आचार्यःof वाल्मीकिः and सद्गुरु त्यागराजः and the propagator
of bhakti-siddhAnta.

He is also a great ब्रह्मवादिन् as per the below:

उर्ज्जयोनिरुदापेक्षी नारदश्च महानृषिः । विश्वामित्रात्मजाः सर्व्वे मुनयो ब्रह्मवादिनः

rgs,
sriram
