Namaste Sriram ji
I have not got any message from the Advaita group with the statement quoted
by you viz.,
" Mere studying books will make one a mantravit like Narada, never an
 Atmavit".

Also it's not clear what the adhyayanam with shraddA of Advaita shastra
related passages from Lakshmidhara's work , has to do with 'mere study of
books' presumably of paperbacks etc.

Om

Raghav
