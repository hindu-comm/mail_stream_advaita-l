The composition date of Yoga Yajnavalkya is unclear. Prahlad Divanji, an
Indologist and Sanskrit scholar, states that the text was composed between
the second century BCE and fourth century CE, because Yoga Upanishads and
Hatha Yoga texts contain verses from Yoga Yajnavalkya. [16][17] Divanji
cites Tantra texts, Ayurveda tradition texts, and literature of Advaita
Vedanta from the 4th century CE, which mention the Yoga Yajnavalkya,
thereafter concluding that the text or some version of the Yoga
Yajnavalkyatext must have been in existence by the 4th century CE.

The work, extremely ancient, contains core advaitic tenets. A short
selection is available here:
