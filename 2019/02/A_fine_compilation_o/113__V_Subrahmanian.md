I landed by chance on this beautiful compilation by Sri Sandeep Nangia:
The repertoire includes Shankaracharya as well.

While all the quotes are familiar to me, what came as surprise is this
verse, though very familiar, was unknown as to its source: The
HanumannATakam.  This work is said to be authored by Hanuman himself and
Bhoja Raja (early 11th century CE) got this compiled/edited by Damodara
Misra of his court.

यं शैवाः समुपासते शिव इति ब्रह्मेति वेदान्तिनो
बौद्धा बुद्ध इति प्रमाणपटवः कर्तेति नैयायिकाः।
अर्हन्नित्यथ जैनशासनरताः कर्मेति मीमांसकाः
सोऽयं नो विदधातु वाञ्छितफलं त्रैलोक्यनाथो हरिः ॥
(हनुमन्नाटकम् १.३)
