Selections from the Vrata KaaNDa of the Krtya Kalpataru of Lakshmidhara
(12th Century CE)


The Krtya kalpataru of Bhatta Lakshmidhara is a dharma shaastra nibandhana
work of early 12th Century CE. From the Moksha kANDa of this mega work we
come to know that the author was an Advaitin. Now, in the Vrata kANDa of
this work some selections are shown which bring out the fact that he has
considered Hari-Hara abhedam, Tirmurti aikya, worship of Devi, etc. are
completely Vedic and to be practiced by vaidikas. The page numbers are for
the scanned text and not of the pdf.  He has cited from the Devi, Kaalikaa,
Kurma, etc. Puranams.
