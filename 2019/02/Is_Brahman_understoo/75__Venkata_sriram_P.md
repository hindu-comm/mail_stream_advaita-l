Namaste SV ji,

Nice write up.

.........................
In Dvaita school, they give high importance to study and understand Advaita in all its epistemology,
ontology and theology among all other things
.................

The above statement made me remind of my teacher's words who says the 
magnum opus 'advaita-siddhi' is read more by dvaitis than advaitins :)

rgs,
sriram
