This is the crux. As to what is badhaka pramana is itself a point of
contention. So, what is badhaka pramana/vakya for Advaitin is not so for
the Dvaitin. Hence you cannot settle it on the above lines.

This is agreeable to the Advaitin. The Lakshmi 'tattva' can be something
subservient/supportive to the Brahma 'tattva'. Naturally the mukhyartha of
bharya, patni, etc. is given up. That is what the Advaitin settles for.
When mukhyartha is given up what remains is only gaunartha. This is called
metaphorical.

Advaita also accepts only what comes from shaastra alone is pramana.
Shastra says 'ashabdam asparsham aruupam...' and also 'bhArupaH, hiraNya
smashru, etc. ('bright hue, golden mustache...etc'.) Advaitins hold that
Brahman cannot be both. They hold that specifying form, color, etc. is for
upasana purpose and the denying them is for jnana, saakshaatkaara, purpose.
Thus, body parts are possible only when Brahman is conceived of as a
person, saguna, savishesha, sopadhika.

The Veda talks of both param and aparam Brahma. Advaitins take the
specification as above to be about aparam Brahma.

Actually advaita does not say the above. desha and kaala are separately
dealt with: Brahman is desha and kaala pariccheda shuunya. And it is vastu
pariccheda rahita too.

Actually the two alternatives you give above is one only. When we say 1,
the 2 is implied in that. It is for the precise reason that Brahman should
not be material, the visheshana 'jnanam' is given by the Upanishad.

In the Taittiriya bhashya, the development is thus: if Jnanam is admitted
to be finite, vritti, vikara jnanam, Brahman cannot be stated to be Ananta.
So, this Jnanam is jnapti, kevala chaitanyam, Chit. If Brahman has to be
anantam truly, sajaatiya, vijaatiya and svagata bheda should be denied.
There is disagreement between D and A only with regard to vijatiya bheda.

Not so. Bheda is thought to be there only because of thinking the
Brahma-bhinna vastu/s to be real. The VaachaarambhaNa shruti teaches:
vikara is only a name and the upadana kaarana alone is satyam. So, whatever
is experienced as different from Brahman is actually Brahman's vivarta
alone and they are unreal as name and form. Thus the problems you try to
saddle Advaita with really do not exist for the Advaitin.

As I said before, this shruti is only about apara brahman.

For Advaita, even Anantatva is only from a relative point of view. When
there is Only one in the absolute sense, there is no reason to say it is
ananta. The need for the shruti to say 'brahman is ananta' is only in the
face of antavattva shankaa owing to taking the objects of the world as
brahma-bhinna.

Shrutis such as sarvam khalvidam brahma, brahmaivedam sarvam, Atmaivedam
sarvam are bAdhaka for the above idea. You may give different meanings to
these vaakyas. But, again, that is the crux of the DvaitAdvaita conflict.

The reason is: in the world it is seen an object is limited by three
factors: desha, kaala and vastu. Hence to deny Brahman's paricchinnatva
shankaa due to these three factors, the three are separately dealt with.
Thus it would be wrong to say that desha and kaala are subsumed in vastu
category. In fact Advaita holds desha and kaala too to be kalpita just like
other objects. But the kalpana of any object, vastu, is done
'etaddesha-vartitvena, etat-kaala-vartitvena'. Hence desha and kaala are to
be separately dealt with.

No so. They are unreal because the shruti 'vAchArambhaNam....mrittiketyeva
satyam'. The shruti declares all kaarya to be un real, mithya, and holds
only the kaaraNam to be abaadhita satyam. Only because baadha happens to
kaarya, that includes desha kaala and vastu, they are held to be unreal.
Not because Shankaracharya likes it to be so :-)

There is no need for any correction since it is based on shruti and yukti.

Shrutis such as 'ashabdam, asparsham aruupam, anantam' are baadhaka pramana
for shrutis that specify form, color, etc. to Brahman.

Advaita accepts aprAkruta thus: something that comes/arrives/born as a
transformation, vikara, evolution, of prakriti through pancha bhuta route,
is praakrutha, as for example, our bodies. But Brahman taking avatara-s
such as Narasimha is not through this route. It happens by mere sankalpa.
Even here, in bodies such as Krishna we know that the body grew, became
old, and even died. Yet it is held apraakrutha.

There is no need to accept apraakrutha to hold Vishnu to be omnipresent.
The word Vishnu itself has the dhaatu: vish vyaapine. That is the meaning
of 'tad vishnoH paramam padam' for Advaitins. It is not Lakshmipathi or
Vaikunthapati for Advaitins.

This holds to both parties. When purvapaksha is made, the other paksha has
to be clearly understood. The example is the nice way Sri Nagasampige
Acharya did the purvapaksha manDana in the video on Tat tvam asi you
shared.
