Srinathji - PraNAms
Enjoyed reading your post, presenting Dwaitin perspective. There are bheda vakyaas as well as abheda vaakyas in the shruti -
Different Acharyas have provided importance either to the first or to the second, and developed self-consistent doctrinal systems.
Let us bow down to their wisdom.

 Dear Subrahmanian-ji,

You have asked some good questions.

In this post, I will try to explain the Dvaita's paksha in my own little
humble capacity. I will primarily focus on the methods using which such
paksha was arrived.

Please note that I am not all a scholar in this system and may not give
much clarity. Please be advised to study their original works or consult
any pundits in Bangalore.

Do Madhva's take them mere metaphorical?

No. Their paksha is that unless shruti pramANa itself indicates so that
they are to be taken likewise, it is wrong to consider so. How does one
know sometimes shruti should be taken literally and sometimes as
metaphorical (or arthavAda or attavavEdaka etc.)? Dvaita's stand is that
as long as there are no bAdhaka from niravakASha sentences elsewhere,
literal meaning should not be rejected.

Its siddhanta is also that all vaidIka words needs to be understood in
their yogika artha. So, the current terms 'bhArya' or 'patni' etc. should
not be understood in terms of rudyAtha (rudimentary meaning) and rejected
as metaphorical.

Then how do we suppose to interpret 'bhArya' shabda? Words can be taken by
their tadgatatvam (presence of properties in question), or tadadhInatvam
(dependence of tatvas having such attributes on the anuyOgi where the word
is being applied) etc. So in this sense Sri/LakshmI tattva being depend on
Brahma tattva, there is no problem in Purusha sUkta calling them Brahman's
'patni' . It is our limitation applying our mundane meaning of patni on
vaidIka tatvaM.

For non-dualist, it is difficult to accept there are more than one tattvaM,
hence relationship (between tattava-s) is not acceptable. Hence they try to
explain away such words those seems to indicate relationships. But one
should understand the very fundamental ontological position of Dvaita and
hence meaning of those words as 'bhArya' etc. One should not just take
conclusions which are dislodged from such ontological position.

Your hEtu -- that having dEhAdi anga-s imply and possible only in physical
beings. Such hEtu is based on pratyakSha, not from Shruti. Madhva argues
given that Brahma tattvaM is indria agochara but known only by shAstra (do
not forget the hEtu given by sUtrakAra B is only 'shAstra yOnitvAt'),
anything one says (positively or negatively) MUST come from shAstra only.
Pratyaksha and logic based on pratyaksha is impotent in telling anything
about Brahman.

Glad you mentioned this topic.

Veda defines Brahman as "brihantO hi asmin guNaaha" for its own question
'ata kasmAt ucchatE bhrhmEti'. What is that brihAt nature of His guNas?

"Anantam" should not be interpreted as non-difference from
space-time-vastu. Why?

Brahman is aparichinna - Unlimited, if it is taken by itself, ends in
contradictions and confusion. Why ?
To understand why so, let us examine advaita vedAnta that you are already
familiar with.

To hold that there is a second thing different from Brahman, is to hold
that Brahman is limited by that second thing. To solve this, one may say
either,
1) Brahman and the thing are non-different or
2) There is nothing apart from Brahman.

The first one makes Brahman a material object, and to hold that Brahman is
spiritual becomes impossible, after that. Unless Brahman is spiritual, it
can not be svaprakAsha, self-evident. Unless it is self-evident there is
nothing to present It. If we ever come to this conclusion, is to lose
Brahman and with it all higher values in life. So, Brahman can not be
identified
with matter.

But to hold that there is matter, is to limit Brahman. Therefore, it
becomes necessary to hold the second alternative i.,e that matter is
unreal. Anything apart from Brahman,
Space, time etc all have to be unreal. Hence, to hold that Brahman is
unlimited actually results that
anything other than Brahman is unreal.

But in this option, the difficulty does not end there. If matter is unreal,
then the absence of limitation from it becomes unreal too. This ends up in
saying that presence of
limitation is real.

Hence the supposition that Brahman is aparichinna along with non-brahman
vastus are either non-different / unreal ; ends up in hopeless
contradictions.

Please remember that Veda has already defined 'brihantO-hi asmin guNaaha'
by the very word Brahman. If Brahman were to be understood as expounded by
Shruti, 'brihantO hi asmin
guNaaha' a genuine position would be logical, self consistent and therefore
free from contradiction and confusion.

So, the correct alternative is that non-difference and non-limitation are
not the implications of each other.

Brahman may be unlimited, but it may not be non-different. In spite of its
being different from particular entities, It may still be aparichinna,
unlimited.

AchArya Madhva sees that the logic behind the conception of aparichinna
requires the cognition of difference, bhEda of Brahman from dEsha, kAla and
vastu. Hence it is not opposed to the reality of those entities.

If I remember correctly Sri. Sadananda-ji was saying this relation as
"Advaita in spite of Dvaita" , of course he was saying in a different
context, but quite true as for as aparichinntva of Brahman!

Sri VyAsateertha (of nyayAmrita fame) explains it in His tAtparya-chandrikA
as,
"deshataha kAlataschiava guNataschApi poorNatA brahmatA. natu bhEdasya
rAhityam brahmatA ishyatE"
(The completeness from the standpoints of space, time, and attributes is
what constitutes Brahman-hood. It is never non-difference that constitutes
Brahman-hood.)

The conception of aparichinnatva when taken with bhEda, i.e.,
non-limitation taken with difference necessarily results in guNa-poorNatva.
If it is not recognized, then neither aparichinnatva nor bhEda becomes
justified. Aparichinnatva taken by itself ends up in contradictions and
confusion as seen above. On the otherhand, bhEda taken by itself ends up in
pluralism i.e, exclusiveness of things (remember hopeless dualism?) . In
either case, knowledge is not obtained, Shruti which defines Brahman as
"brihantO hi asmin guNaaha" is not understood and Vedic Brahman is lost.


In advaita school, Brahman is said to be 'beyond' space and time. But when
it comes to vastu paricchinnatvaM, why it was told vastu is unreal? For
that matter, both dESha and kAla are indeed vastu-s in their own rights. If
Brahman is beyond dESha-kAla, so also He is beyond vastu. Why that should
make vastus unreal?

Sri Shankara thinks that these three, because they are jaDa in nature, must
be different from Brahman and with this difference Brahman cannot be
aparichinna, he holds that these entities are unreal. (the word mithyA is
not going to help either). So, his position amounts to saying that these
entities are not unreal on their own merit but they are unreal because as
real
entities they do not suit his theory. His theory is founded on an
assumption that aparichinna means only the idea he has in his mind and
bhEda means the negation of aparichinna.

AchArya Madhva corrects this position, by recognizing that the logic behind
the conception of aparichinna requires the recognition of difference, bhEda
of Brahman from dEsha, kAla and vastu. Hence it is not opposed to the
reality of these entities. Without the recognition of these ideas, it
becomes wrong to hold that Brahman is all-exclusive. Without being
all-inclusive Brahman cannot be aparichinna. All-inclusiveness is
poorNatva. Hence aparichinna means the state of being pUrNa from the stand
point of dEsha, kAla and vastu.

Vastu, dEsha, kAla are all expression of attributes, guNas. This is how,
aparichinnatva along with bhEda, has resulted in guNa-poorNatva of Brahman
in Dvaita vEdAnta.

As discussed above, this conclusion is not correct.

Other tatva-s (other than Brahma tatva) are real for Madhva. The
relationship of these other tatva-s with Brahman is also real. This
relationship is that of dependence nature. To explain these things, He is
the only one among tri-mAtAchraya wrote bhAshya on RigvEda. In that work he
explains all about Brhamn and His dEvAtA parivAra in all its glory. Please
read if you find a chance.

There is no shAstra pramANa to hold so (that such are only metaphor).

If aprAkrutha is not admitted, there are host of contradictions arise. You
cannot explain arrival of Narashima from jada pillar. No body accepts two
prakritika vastus would occupy same space at the same time.

If aprAkrutha is not admitted, you have no fidelity in saying 'Vishnu' word
indicates omnipresence. Nobody would accepts two two prakritika vastus
would occupy same space at the same time.

In the end I can only advice you that -- In arriving at all your
arguments, please do not focus only on the conclusions of your
pUrvapakshin, but instead try to understand the method and means used to
arrive at their conclusions. Epistemology is fundamental and as critical as
Ontology to know any siddhAnta. In Dvaita school, they give high
importance to study and understand Advaita in all its epistemology,
ontology and theology among all other things. They just do not teach how
one needs to understand, but they also teach how one not to understand
wrongly so.
