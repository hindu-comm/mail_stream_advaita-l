Narasimha would visit the Sharadambal
temple everyday and also offer his respects to
his Acharya. The guru noticed the regularity and
deep devotion of Narasimha and was happy
about it. If he was absent some day the Acharya
would miss him and enquire, “Why has
Narasimha not come today?”

Narasimha’s, memory was prodigious, his
intelligence was sparkling and his conduct was
humble and simple. His parents performed the
sastraically prescribed rite of choodakarma (it is
one of the 16 samskaras prescribed in sastras)
which enables a boy to enter a school for formal
studies. He was then admitted to the local Anglo-
venacular school run by the Government.

Narasimha was not at all made for the secular
education. But the parents did not consider his
inclinations and predispositions. They had had
enough of penury and wished that their long
cherished only surviving child should have a
successful career and have all the good things in
life. Thus, Narasimha used to study Sanskrit at
home and English at school.

The Brahmopadesha of Narasimha was
performed when he was eight. He was regular
in the performance of sandhyavandana three
times each day and agnikarya, worship of fire
god, twice daily.

Narasimha excelled in his class. In his twelfth
year, Narasimha took the lower secondary
examination and topped the list in the first
division. This excellent performance confirmed
the dreams which his parents had set in their
minds. They visualized a bright career for him.
However, Narasimha was just not made for a
wordly career. He was the child of God born to
adorn the Sharada Peetha.

According to its plans, the divine soon took
the matter of his future education into its own
hands. Narasimha changed over to Sadvidya
Sanjeevini Pathasala of the Peetha, according to
the express wishes of Sri Narasimha Bharathi
Mahaswami.
