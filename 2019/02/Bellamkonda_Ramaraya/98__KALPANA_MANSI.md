Pranam to all


bellamkonda' would become गुडशैलः as bellam means jaggery and konda means
mountain in telugu.

So, the sanskritised name would be गुडशैल रामराय कविः :))

in this context, there is another work in Telugu by Ramaraya Kavi -
entitled "KANDARPA DARPA VILASABANAM PRABANDHU" IN it he is known as
"Aparasankaradu" in Telugu literature.

Regards
kalpana
