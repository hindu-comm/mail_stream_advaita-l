Namaste,

The Wikipedia says:

..................
His biographer and first disciple Lanka Sundararama Sastri had written in his book that Rama Rao was initiated into spirituality at the age of 14.[10] 
As a consequence of his initiation into spiritual realm, Rama Rao has changed his name from 'Rao' to 'Raya'.
.....................

Infact, the sanskrit version for 'Rao' is रायः.  Even, the name of great shAkta was 'Bhaskar Rao' 
and the sanskritised version became भास्कररायः.

On a lighter vein - the 'bellamkonda' would become गुडशैलः as bellam means jaggery and konda means mountain in telugu.

So, the sanskritised name would be गुडशैल रामराय कविः :))

rgs,
sriram
