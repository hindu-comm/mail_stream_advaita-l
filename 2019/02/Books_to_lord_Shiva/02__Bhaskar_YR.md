Hare Krishna

You can add to your list like vishNu sahasranaama, Vishnu purANa, mukundamaala, bhagavadgeeta, bhAgavat etc.  surprising??  Well, being an advaitin, we should not because shivAya vishNu rUpAya, shiva rUpAya vishNave...So, whatever you read about vishNu that is equally applicable to shiva and vice versa this is so because 'tattva' behind shiva and vishNu is one and the same...Anyway, this is for those who are only particular about knowing the shiva tattva and not so particular about his siblings and surroundings  ðŸ˜Š 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
Bhaskar

Namaste Kartik ji,

Sri Subramanian ji and Sri Venkatram ji are amongst senior knowledgeable members who gave you suggestions. Please refer to their suggestions.
I do not read much in English. My first choice is my mother tongue Gujarati, next comes Hindi and last is English. English lacks depthness of many words like Guru, Atman, etc. There is no real alternative. Translated words at times do not carry bhAvArtha. English translations do not touch my heart and so are not useful in instilling bhakti in my heart.

I can give few names, getting English translation is left to you. Maybe members can point good translations.

Stotra-s / stuti-s
1. Sivamahimna stotra
2. SivatANDava stotra
3. SivAnanda Lahari
4. other stotra-s like Siva kshamApanA stotra etc

These stotra-s help instill bhakti in our heart. Need to keep repeating it.
After knowing meaning, if audio is available, best is to listen to them.

5. Siva saharanAma from anushAShaNika parva of mahAbhArata

There are one than one Siva sahasranAma stotra-s, hence classification.

This one is very popular. I have a copy of English Translation published by Sri Ramakrishna Math by Swami Chidbhavananda.

Reflecting on Siva ShasranAma one can realise that Siva is everything.
Nothing Exists that is not Siva. Siva can do everything and anything and so we must unconditionally surrender to him.

Beautiful recitation is found on youtube

6. Sri Rudram of Yajur veda / Rudri Path / Satarudriya / Rudra Prashna

Other members can give alternate translation.

There are other texts like Sri dakshiNAmUtri stotra with is usually studied along with commentary mAnsollAsa (of polemical nature to some extend).
Samata Books has published English Translation. This is studied only by advance seekers.

There is saying by the wise - Less but repetitive reading is helpful then reading many texts.
Meditation is the key. Chanting the name - beej mantra helps unfold the real meaning, the lakshyArtha of the text or stuti.

Sri Venkat Sriram ji had earlier given a way on how to have Sri Dakshinamurty as the guru if one does not have one.

Just my 2 cc.

I hope this helps.

OM
