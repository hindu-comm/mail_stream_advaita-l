Pranams Sri Bhaskar Prabhu ji,

I could feel the Krishna Prem :)

To stop quarreling, this Nahi-Ninda Nyaya is very useful (technically you
are right). But for bhakti purposes, Hai Bol is so spontaneous, not Har Har
Mahadev - though both are same (technically :) )

btw, I used to chant rAma nAma and also hanumAna nAma in my initial stages.
Used to enjoy it. I am also enjoying OM chanting now :)

OM

Sujal
