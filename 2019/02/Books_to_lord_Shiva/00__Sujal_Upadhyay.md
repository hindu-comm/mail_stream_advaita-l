Namaste Kartik ji,

Sri Subramanian ji and Sri Venkatram ji are amongst senior knowledgeable
members who gave you suggestions. Please refer to their suggestions.
I do not read much in English. My first choice is my mother tongue
Gujarati, next comes Hindi and last is English. English lacks depthness of
many words like Guru, Atman, etc. There is no real alternative. Translated
words at times do not carry bhAvArtha. English translations do not touch my
heart and so are not useful in instilling bhakti in my heart.

I can give few names, getting English translation is left to you. Maybe
members can point good translations.

Stotra-s / stuti-s
1. Sivamahimna stotra
2. SivatANDava stotra
3. SivAnanda Lahari
4. other stotra-s like Siva kshamApanA stotra etc

These stotra-s help instill bhakti in our heart. Need to keep repeating it.
After knowing meaning, if audio is available, best is to listen to them.

5. Siva saharanAma from anushAShaNika parva of mahAbhArata

There are one than one Siva sahasranAma stotra-s, hence classification.
Ref:
http://www.advaita-vedanta.in/adi-shankara-preached-smarta-dharma#TOC-Common-names-and-some-selected-names-in-Shiva-Sahasranama

This one is very popular. I have a copy of English Translation published by
Sri Ramakrishna Math by Swami Chidbhavananda.

Reflecting on Siva ShasranAma one can realise that Siva is everything.
Nothing Exists that is not Siva. Siva can do everything and anything and so
we must unconditionally surrender to him.

Beautiful recitation is found on youtube

Chanted by Pandit Shounak Abhisheki

6. Sri Rudram of Yajur veda / Rudri Path / Satarudriya / Rudra Prashna

This Vedic hymn is regarded in high esteem by mangreat AchArya-s. It is
also mentioned in Kaivalya Upanishad (Kai.Up. 25) to chant Satrudriyam even
by sanyASI-s

7. Periya pUrANam / 63 nayanAra SAints - Swami Sivananda has given brief
into upload on website of Divine Life Society..

8. Siva gItA of padma pUrANa

Recommended for sincere seekers. Has some unique adhyAya like jIva
nirUpaNa, etc.

Other members can give alternate translation.

There are other texts like Sri dakshiNAmUtri stotra with is usually studied
along with commentary mAnsollAsa (of polemical nature to some extend).
Samata Books has published English Translation. This is studied only by
advance seekers.

There is saying by the wise - Less but repetitive reading is helpful then
reading many texts.
Meditation is the key. Chanting the name - beej mantra helps unfold the
real meaning, the lakshyArtha of the text or stuti.

Sri Venkat Sriram ji had earlier given a way on how to have Sri
Dakshinamurty as the guru if one does not have one.

Just my 2 cc.

I hope this helps.

OM

Sujal
