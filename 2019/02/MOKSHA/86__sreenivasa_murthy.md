Dear friends,
Sri Shankara says :
 brahmaBAvaSca mOkshaH ||[Commentary to brahmasutra 1-1-4]ayamAtmA brahma || 
[mAMDUkya mantra 2] AtmA ca brahma ||[Commentary to Brahmasutra 1-1-1]
Hence it follows that one's true svarUpa or AtmAis mOkSha.Then what has to be done?Engage in endless discussionsor engage oneself in knowing one's true svarUpa?One who wants to be a mantravit will choose the first one.One who wants to be an Atmavit 
will choose the second one.

As The Lord says " yathEcCasi tathA kuru".With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.
