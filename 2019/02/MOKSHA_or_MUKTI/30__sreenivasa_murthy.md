  Dear Sri Bhaskarji, Sri Shankara , in his commentary to mantra 1-1-10 
 of Kathopanishad writes thus :"vijnAnaikarasaM nairantaryENa AkASavat 
parupUrNaM brahmaivAhamasmi" iti manyEt||In the light of the above teaching of Sri Shankarawill any of the concepts as enumerated in the last 
paragraph of your posting hold any water?Any one who has clearly understood and realizedthe true import of the above quoted teaching ofSri Shankara will never make such erroneous 
statements. Because of the ignorance of the factthat Jnani is Atman / Brahman only and never an entity or an individual isthe sole reason for such misconceptions.Bhagavan Ramana says :" There is no jnani, but only Jnana".What does it mean?
With respectful namankars,Sreenivasa Murthy

The inquiry into the SELF can be over in a jiffy if the person is one hundred percent 'sadhana chatushTya samppanna'. Not even nine times as happened to Shwetaketu. If not the 'knowledge' will remain as a scholarship until with enough 'mananam' and 'nidhidhyasanam', the clutter is cleared and the student clearly remembers and understands the words spoken to him earlier in 'shravaNam' by his Guru who is a 'shrotRiya Brahma nishTa'.

> and arjuna needed around 16 and half chapters more than 600 shloka-s from veda purusha himself to finally declare nashtO mOha smutir labhdvA ðŸ˜Š And to teach us it is a gradual process, there is multiple investigation in taitireeya, varuNam pitaramupasatAra adheehi bhagavO brahmeti ðŸ˜Š Yes, some uttama adhikAri-s on account of pUrva janma saMskAra may get this knowledge like a flash as in the case of ramaNa maharshi....but maNda and madhyama adhikAri-s need continuous mananaM and nidhidhyAsanaM.


It's like some jokes will not hit us immediately when spoken but might impact us later and then a smile will break on the lips. And whether one is a 'jIvan muktha', only the person will know ! As 'jnAnis' (jIvam mukthas) one is different from another owing to the 'lesa pRArabdhas', 'vasAnAs' etc that is keeping their 'BMI' until the momentum of 'pRArabdhm' spin is over and the person is a 'videha muktha'.

> Yes, by accepting this scenario post-jnAna period, we are invariably accepting the upa-siddhAnta like even after brahma jnana there is an individuality to jnAni, there is separate set of BMI to different jnAni-s, there is separate deposit of avidyA lesha / prArabdha karma to each and every jnAni and there is a separate status than can be achieved ONLY after shedding the body of the jnAni which cannot be achieved when he is in the physical body. And as a result we are accepting that there is srushti, there is upAdhi, there is karma and there is karma phala to the individual jnAni-s ever after their realization that they are indeed ONE without Second. Am I right in this way of thinking?? Kindly note I am not talking about vyavahArika satya of some ajnAni-s who still see the jnAni and his vyavahAra I am talking about the conception which clearly states the post jnana status of an individual jnAni and his personal belongings like individual set of upAdhi-s and his own prArabdha karma and residue of avidyA. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
Bhaskar
