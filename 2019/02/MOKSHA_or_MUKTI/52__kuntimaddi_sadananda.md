Balagopalji - PraNAms
I do not see anything wrong in your post or with your post.
There are differences in Adhikaries - Broadly uttama, madhyama and adhama and Vedanta caters to all. Extensive discussions have been provided in terms of obstacles for Self-Realization by Goudapada and others. Nidhidhyaasana is intended mainly for the madhyama adhikaaries since most of us are not Nachiketas.
Hari Om!Sadananda

 Namaste Sreenivasa Murthy Ji,
I fully appreciate your angst.
Reply to the posts need not always be critical. It could also be something related in the post. As your post was about 'moksha, avidya' etc i expressed my two cents.
If a post is made as a 'reply' to a post and prefers it not to be seen in the group, one can always request to NOT to respond the same in the group but to send it personally. And then the person can decide whether it is appropriate to put it into the group or not.
But overall i feel the groups are basically for generating more and more thoughts regarding 'advaita'. Some may be directly targeted to the contents of the post, some will be as an addition, or some could be not directly related but more common in nature etc.
I think posts that are related to 'advaita vedanta' shall be allowed to be posted freely as long as it confirms to the austerity of speech as mentioned by BhagavAn: 'anudvekakaram vaakyam....uchyate'
At this juncture i only can apologise to you as i have already disturbed you in some way.
With sincere apologies, once again.
Respectfully Yours,
Balagopal

 Dear Sri Balagopal Ramakrishna, I fail to understand the relevance of 
 your response to the posting of mine.If at all you were interested to convey your observations 
about the posting you should have confined yourself 
to the contents of the posting.But you have written something which has no bearing at all 
with the subject matter.This is my observation.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.

 Namaste Sreenivasa Ji,
The inquiry into the SELF can be over in a jiffy if the person is one hundred percent 'sadhana chatushTya samppanna'. Not even nine times as happened to Shwetaketu.
If not the 'knowledge' will remain as a scholarship until with enough 'mananam' and 'nidhidhyasanam', the clutter is cleared and the student clearly remembers and understands the words spoken to him earlier in 'shravaNam' by his Guru who is a 'shrotRiya Brahma nishTa'.
It's like some jokes will not hit us immediately when spoken but might impact us later and then a smile will break on the lips.
And whether one is a 'jIvan muktha', only the person will know ! As 'jnAnis' (jIvam mukthas) one is different from another owing to the 'lesa pRArabdhas', 'vasAnAs' etc that is keeping their 'BMI' until the momentum of 'pRArabdhm' spin is over and the person is a 'videha muktha'.
Thanks for the references.
Regards
Balagopal

Dear friends,
Sri Shankara in his commentry to mantra 3-2-4 of 
MundakopaniShad writes :avidyApratibandhamAtrO hi mOkShaHnAnyapratibandhaH nityatvAt AtmaButatvAcca ||
So the only obstacle for mOkSha is avidyA.What is avdyA then ?Sri Shankara writes in his commentary to Sutra 1-3-2 of Brahmasutra thus :dEhAdiShu anAtmasu "ahamasmi" ityAtmabuddhiravidyA ||
Then what is vidyA?Sri Shankara writes in UpadEsasahasri chapter 1 Shloka 12 thus :"nirvikArAtmabuddhiSca vidyEtIha prakIrtitA ||
It is this TRUTH that "one is the Changeless Principle 
amidst the changing ones" that has to be 
cognized / realized by a  sincere student of Vedanta 
whose goal is to be an Atmavit. 
Any other activity of mind other than this 
is a mere waste of time. 
The only thing to be done by the student of Vedanta 
is "AtmasaMsthaM manaH kRutvA" .Thus taught my revered Guru.

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.
