Dear Bhaskar ji,

"By the way according to some even if you quote ramaNa with regard to jnAni
and his attitude to prove that jnAni was / is / will ever be ashareeri  &
jnana only and jnAniâ€™s sashareeratvaM  is in the sight of ajnAni only there
is no jnAniâ€™s BMI and action from the jnAniâ€™s point of view,  it is
â€˜asaMpradAyikâ€™ declaration and not a pramANa in the form of â€˜Apta vAkyaâ€™."

I think the argument between the two camps is because of a misunderstanding
of the meaning of the words "is" and "no" in the above sentence.

Does the existence denoted by the verb "is", pAramArthika sat? Does the
negation referred to by "no", a pAramArthika niShedha, or a vyAvahArika
niShedha? As I see it, if both sides see what is meant, there is no room
for argument at all.

The right meaning of the sentence "there is only jnAna", is as an
akhaNDArtha vAkya, and thus "is" and "jnAna" refer to the svArUpa mAtra of
That, and not to the samsarga between "jnAna" and "is". So the meaning of
the sentence is just like satyam jnAnam anantam of taittiriya.

When it is said "there is no jnAna's BMI and action", is the negation a
pAramArthika negation? If it is pAramArthika, then the the negation is
nothing but the svarUpa of the jnAni alone. If it is a vyAvahArika
negation, then both the negation and the pratiyogi are nothing but mithyA.
So in either case, not sure there is any need for argument between the so
called sAmpradAyika and asAmpradAyika advaitin.

"But the question is do we really have to have the wave-less, wrinkle-less,
bubble-less absolute flat unmoving water to prove that ocean is water and
nothing but water !!??
I really doubt.  If that is the case we may have to wait till mahA pralaya
to witness absolute motionless brahman or kArya-kAraNAteeta kevala
parabrahman."

I agree. Any exhortation to do nothing but remain in samAdhi all the time
is born out of a misunderstanding - for samAdhi is as much vyavahAra, as
any other laukika activity.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
