Dear Raghav ji,

According to the Jivanmukti viveka of Swami Vidyaranya, a difference is
made between a Jnani and a Jivanmukta. He gives the example of Sage
Yajnavalkya of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and says he was a Jnani no
doubt, free from rebirth, but was not free from the onslaughts of prarabdha
in the form of raga, etc. He cites the instances when Y debated with
people, cursed an opponent to death, eyed the wealth offered as prize
money, etc. to make his point. He finally cites Y's departure from home for
sannyasa, seeking peace.  For a jivanmukta such peace is a natural state,
not to be sought.

subbu
