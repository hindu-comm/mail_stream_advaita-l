Dear friends,
Sri Shankara in his commentry to mantra 3-2-4 of 
MundakopaniShad writes :avidyApratibandhamAtrO hi mOkShaHnAnyapratibandhaH nityatvAt AtmaButatvAcca ||
So the only obstacle for mOkSha is avidyA.What is avdyA then ?Sri Shankara writes in his commentary to Sutra 1-3-2 of Brahmasutra thus :dEhAdiShu anAtmasu "ahamasmi" ityAtmabuddhiravidyA ||
Then what is vidyA?Sri Shankara writes in UpadEsasahasri chapter 1 Shloka 12 thus :"nirvikArAtmabuddhiSca vidyEtIha prakIrtitA ||
It is this TRUTH that "one is the Changeless Principle 
 amidst the changing ones" that has to be 
cognized / realized by a  sincere student of Vedanta 
whose goal is to be an Atmavit. 
Any other activity of mind other than this 
is a mere waste of time. 
The only thing to be done by the student of Vedanta 
is "AtmasaMsthaM manaH kRutvA" .Thus taught my revered Guru.

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.
