Namaste Sri Bhaskar Ji,



Reg  << Now the question is the sthita prajna or the Atmaikatva paripUrNa
jnAni while living in his current shareera (ofcourse the shareera due to
prArabdha)  could get vrutti-s like rAga-dvesha due to leftovers of avidyA
??  I don’t think in Geeta bhAshya where sthita prajnatvaM explained
comprehensively would throw any light about oscillation of sthita prajnn’s
mind due to avidyA lesha.  OTOH it has been said there : rasavarjaM
rasOpyasya, paraM drushvA nivartate, rAga-dveshaviyuktaistu
vishAnindriyaischaran…And this is what brAhmee sthitiH says bhagavAn.
Anyways, I am not debating your stand here, just expressing my doubt >>,



My understanding is as follows. True, sthita prajna is devoid of
rAga-dvesha. However if you were to include BMI also in avidyA lesha, then
indeed sthita prajna has it.



Regards
