praNAms Sri Chandramouli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Namaste Sri Bhaskar Ji,
Reg  << one camp (the ‘is’ camp)  was saying during the post jnana period (after samyak jnana / absolute realization) there is continuity of identification with bhautika shareera by the jnAni and due to avidyA lesha / prArabdha karma he is prone to get rAga-dvesha but survival of these vrutti-s are very short (in time span) and his jnana would mitigate against these bhAvana >>,
While my understanding is generally in line with this, it is different in respect of the succeeding part

  *    Yes, I remember that you were saying there is an individual jnAni, he has his own set of BMI with all masala-s like rAga dvesha but he will not be influenced by them and it will just come and go…he will get the bhAva-s like shOka and mOha but resultant pravrutti due to these bhAvana-s/vrutti-s will not be there.  He will not ‘act’ but he does get ‘vrutti’ like kAma krOdha.  And you know my objection to this as well.  And I don’t have to repeat here how Sri SSS debated this avidyA lesha in paramArtha jnAni in his various works.  avidyA lesha and paramArtha jnana are poles apart two different things cannot take same place and at the same time.  If even tip of the hair (vAlAgra mAtramapi)of  avidyA is there in someone then he cannot be called as paramArtha jnAni.

<<  If you want to have the absolute ‘freedom’ from these vrutti-s he has to shed his mortal coil thence there is a gap between paramArtha jnana & absolute mOksha >>.
 It is not so. The jnAni can attain such “ freedom “ with the current body itself. In fact in my understanding of the Bhashya, Brahmavidya culminates ONLY on attainment of such a status and not with the attainment of jnAna alone. That part of the sAdhana is temed vidvat sanyAsa. This state is in the primary sense what is termed mOksha or kaivalya or vAishNavapada in advaita sidhanta.

Ø     Some knowers of traditions says that Videha mukti is mukhya mukti and jnana accrued while living in bhautika shareera is gaUNa (not so important).  They quote chAdOgya with regard to this.  According to them prArabdha karma janita vartamAna sthUla shareera and avidyA lesha is the main obstruction to attain mukhya mukti or avidyA rahita paripUrNa jnana.

Reg  << In short mind inert state samAdhi experience is mandatory to ‘practically’ enjoy the ONENESS of Atman >>,
Mind is not inert while enjoying ONENESS with the Atman. Rather it is more appropriate to say scintillating rather than inert. I am inclined to believe that the outpourings of the Shrutis themselves  were  perhaps when the mantradrashtAs were in such a state only.

  *    I was just trying to convey the samAdhi as expressed in patanjala ashtanga yOga which is highlighted in parakaraNa-s like VC,  Jeevan mukti viveka etc. which is equated with sushupti by bhAshyakAra.
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
