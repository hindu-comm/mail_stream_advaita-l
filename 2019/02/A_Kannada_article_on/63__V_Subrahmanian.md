Sri Kumara Vyasa, the author of a poetical work on Mahabharatha, lived a
few centuries ago. There is a belief among some followers of the Madhva
school that he was influenced by Sri Vyasa Tirtha. Sri G.R.Patil, Dharwad,
has penned a short article in Kannada giving a number of references from
Kumara Vyasa's work to show that he was an Advaitin and a Hari-Hara abheda
vaadin.  The article is available here for download:
