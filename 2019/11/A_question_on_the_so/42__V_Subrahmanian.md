In this talk Sri R.Ganesh cites a shloka as from the Brihadaranyaka Vartika
of Sureshvaracharya:  But I have known this to be from the  Panchadashi:

निरूपयितुमारब्धे निखिलैरपि पण्डितै: ।

अज्ञानं पुरतस्तेषां भाति कक्ष्यासु कासुचित् ॥ [6.143]

143. Even if all the learned people of the world try to determine the
nature of this world, they will find themselves confronted at some stage or
the other by ignorance.

If anyone has seen this verse in the Vartika, pl. provide the reference.

Thanks and regards
subbu
