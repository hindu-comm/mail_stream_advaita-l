.........
but Sri Chandrashekara Bharathi Mahaswamigal (the 34th pontiff of Sringeri) 
has said that the reference could be to Sri Adi Shankara himself
...............

The commentaries of saundaryalahari लक्ष्मीधरा, सौभाग्यवर्धिनी, अरुणामोदिनी, आनन्दगिरिया and तात्पर्यदीपिनी
refer द्रविडशिशुः as भगवद्पादः only.

However, डिण्डिमभाष्यं and गोपालसुन्दरी point द्रविडशिशुः as ज्ञानसंबन्धः (an avatAra of skandaH).

So, both are correct.
