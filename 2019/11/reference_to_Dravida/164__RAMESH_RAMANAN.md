Dear Bala Subrahmanianji,
Pranams,

I too thought likewise, but Sri Chandrashekara Bharathi Mahaswamigal (the 34th pontiff of Sringeri) has said that the reference could be to Sri Adi Shankara himself, as the Goddess is supposed to have breast-fed Sri Adi Shankara in his childhood. 

Namaskarams,Ramesh Ramanan.
