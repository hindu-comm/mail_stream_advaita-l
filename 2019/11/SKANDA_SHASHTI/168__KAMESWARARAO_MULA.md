Dear Members,  
Kartikeya also known as Skanda, solves the mystery of his birth. The word “Skanda” is derived from skanda which means to “spill”(Ejaculation). The legend says that Shiva and Parvati were disturbed while making love and Shiva spilled his semen on the ground(Agni) in the Sharavana Pond which was later protected by six kritikka's, born as baby Kartikeya. Kartikeya also means, “ Krittikas” (Agni Nakshatram), six of the seven highest stars clustered in the night sky. It is believed that these six mothers wanted to nurse baby Kartikeya who, in order to end the argument, grew five more heads so that six mothers can nurse six heads.
The child laments, “I have no name, no parents, no one who can tell me why I was discarded on a mountain side” due to his birth as a a secret Kartikeya, in fact, was born to fulfill a divine mission-to save the devas and the universe as well, more so, to kill the asura Surapadman, the soul-stealer who was granted a boon by none other than Kartikeya’s father Shiva that no one except for Shiva’s offspring, born without Shiva’s union with a female, could either kill or defeat him.In the background of this tale is Surapadma who is so powerful that Indra, king of all the devas, holds his spittoon, Surya and Soma hold the royal umbrella over his head, and Vayu fans him like a slave girl. Surapadma, known as Andhakaara or darkness and Bhayanaka, the terrible one, also steals souls of the living, leaving them behind gibbering in terror, waiting for death to come.
Surapadman, in a fierce battle, was defeated by Murugan (Kartikeya) but when he asked for forgiveness, Surapadma was granted the honour of becoming Kartikeya’s vahana, the peacock, a symbol of joy, rains and liberation from fear.

Kartikeya hitted Tarakasura on his chest with his weapon Shakti resulting in his death.Kartikeya went to mother Parvati, who affectionately took him into her lap. He was appreciated by all the deities and made the supreme commander for chief of army of Deva's.
