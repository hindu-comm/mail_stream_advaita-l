Dear Members,              Indra was back to his kingdom with the help of Skanda and there by offering his daughter Devasena to the devasenadhipathi as a gift. How ever Murugan also married Valli to avoid distinction between poor & rich.

Valli Kalyanam: Therewas a king calledNambirajanof the Kuravas or the hill tribes. Nambirajan worshippedShiva,praying for a daughter, his prayers were answered and it was revealed to himthat he would discover a baby in the nearby woods and that she would be hisdaughter.
Accordinglythe kurava king discovered ‘Vallinayaki’in the woods and brought her up as his own.Valligrew up to be a beautiful maiden andSubramanya- son of Shiva and Parvatisought her hand in marriage.Muruganassumed the form of an old bangle seller,and sold bangles toValli, in return for a local delicacyof honey soaked corn flour. A conversation ensued between the two, which wasinterrupted by the arrival ofValli'sbrothers.Skandaappeared again, in the guise of an oldtribal king and sought her hand in marriage. The brothers materialized again,andSkandatransformed himself into an oldascetic from theHimalayas, and they left the spot.Upsetby the ongoing hindrance,Skandasought the help of his brotherVinayaka- the remover of obstacles, whoappeared on the spot as a wild elephant. The scared Valli, embraced Skanda andpromised to offer him anything in return for protection from the wild beast.Skandasought her hand in marriage, and Valliconsented gladly, realizing that her suitor was none other thanMurugan,whom she and her tribe held in great regard.Vallimarried Murugan and the marriagewas celebrated in great splendor byNambirajan, the king of kuravas.
Six days of the war over the evil forces, devotees undertake fasts,prayers and devotional singing to Lord Muruga. Most of the devotees stayin the temples during these six days. In Tiruchendur and Tiruparankundramevents leading to the conquest of the Asuras are dramatized and enacted, Offering of Kavadi on Skanda Sashti is a form of popular worship.
According to Swami Sivananda " the Lord spent His childhood inTiruchendur and took Mahasamadhi at Kathirgamam. If anyone goes toKathirgamam (Sri Lanka) with faith, devotion and piety, and stays in the templefor two or three days , the Lord Himself grants His vision to thedevotee."

 Dear Members,  
Kartikeya also known as Skanda, solves the mystery of his birth. The word “Skanda” is derived from skanda which means to “spill”(Ejaculation). The legend says that Shiva and Parvati were disturbed while making love and Shiva spilled his semen on the ground(Agni) in the Sharavana Pond which was later protected by six kritikka's, born as baby Kartikeya. Kartikeya also means, “ Krittikas” (Agni Nakshatram), six of the seven highest stars clustered in the night sky. It is believed that these six mothers wanted to nurse baby Kartikeya who, in order to end the argument, grew five more heads so that six mothers can nurse six heads.
The child laments, “I have no name, no parents, no one who can tell me why I was discarded on a mountain side” due to his birth as a a secret Kartikeya, in fact, was born to fulfill a divine mission-to save the devas and the universe as well, more so, to kill the asura Surapadman, the soul-stealer who was granted a boon by none other than Kartikeya’s father Shiva that no one except for Shiva’s offspring, born without Shiva’s union with a female, could either kill or defeat him.In the background of this tale is Surapadma who is so powerful that Indra, king of all the devas, holds his spittoon, Surya and Soma hold the royal umbrella over his head, and Vayu fans him like a slave girl. Surapadma, known as Andhakaara or darkness and Bhayanaka, the terrible one, also steals souls of the living, leaving them behind gibbering in terror, waiting for death to come.
Surapadman, in a fierce battle, was defeated by Murugan (Kartikeya) but when he asked for forgiveness, Surapadma was granted the honour of becoming Kartikeya’s vahana, the peacock, a symbol of joy, rains and liberation from fear.

Kartikeya hitted Tarakasura on his chest with his weapon Shakti resulting in his death.Kartikeya went to mother Parvati, who affectionately took him into her lap. He was appreciated by all the deities and made the supreme commander for chief of army of Deva's.
Yesterday was Tarakasura Samharam & today is Valli Kalyana (Skanda Shasthi)
