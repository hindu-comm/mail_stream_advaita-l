Two Advaita-friendly verses from the Champu Ramayanam of Bhoja


Bhoja was a King of the early 11th Century CE.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhoja

The very first invocation is addressed to Ganesha.  Bhoja says ‘Ganesha
Tattva (His holy Feet) is Vedanta Vedya, to be known through the
Upanishads. He is capable of giving everything that one can ask for,
without having to depend on anyone else.’  This looking upon Ganesha as
Para Brahman is reminiscent of Sarvajnatman, the author of the very eminent
Advaita text ‘Sankshepa shariraka’. This Advaitin was also of the same
period approximately. In this text he has held Ganapathy as ‘Vishvakrit’,
the World-creator.


In another verse, of the invocation itself, Bhoja compares Brahmaa’s act of
creation to be akin to the conjuring up by a magician, Indrajaala. This
idea is very Vedantic in nature.
