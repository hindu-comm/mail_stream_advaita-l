*New E-Book “Enrum Puthiyavar” (Tamil) Available for Free Download*

His Holiness Jagadguru Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamin, the 36th Pontiff of
Sri Sharada Peetham, Sringeri, composed this beautiful verse as a homage to
His Guru, His Holiness Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamin.

*vivekinam maha-prajnam dhairya-audarya-kshama-nidhim |*

*sada-abhinava-purvam tam vidyatirtha-gurum bhaje ||*
(I worship my Guru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha who is endowed with
discrimination and great perception, and is a repository of courage,
forgiveness, and generosity.)

Inspired by its import, Dr. V. N. Muthukumar penned *Enrum Puthiyavar,* a
book in Tamil, demonstrating clearly how each attribute mentioned in the
verse finds perfect consummation in His Holiness Jagadguru Sri Abhinava
Vidyatirtha Mahaswamin. The author credibly substantiates his analysis with
episodes excerpted from the hallowed life of His Holiness Jagadguru Sri
Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamin Himself and from His lucid teachings and
benedictory addresses, in addition to discourses of His Holiness Jagadguru
Sri Bharathi Tirtha Mahaswamin which throw light on the facets of His Guru
mentioned in this verse.

Published by the *Centre for Brahmavidya, Chennai,* this book has been
released with the blessings of His Holiness Mahasannidhanam Sri Bharathi
Tirtha Mahaswamin and His Holiness Sannidhanam Sri Vidhusekhara Bharathi
Swamin on 13 Nov 2019, the 102nd anniversary of His Holiness Jagadguru Sri
Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamin's sacred advent (13 Nov 1917).
