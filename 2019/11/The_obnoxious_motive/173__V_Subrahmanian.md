BNK Sharma has said: The Mani Manjari, Sumadhva Vijaya and Vayustuthi were
composed with a view to bring about propaganda and proselytization of the
new school of Madhvacharya. The meaning of ‘proselytization’ is // To
attempt to convert someone to one’s own religious faith.//
https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Proselytisation

All the three compositions listed above have their quota of demonizing
Shankaracharya and the works have become notorious that way that even some
foreign scholars have lamented on this aspect.

Literature’ – third revised edition p.232/3 in the attachment.

 9. Those who adore and worship with all devotion
The third incarnation which is worshipped by gods
Will be honoured in the heaven, Vaikunthaloka
They get delightful divine robes and all the comforts
The heavenly servants provide cool breeze with chamaras
Divine damsels will hug them and provide the charms of embrace.

   1. Your abode Vaikuntha abounds with bewitching dance
   Devine damsels provide music which is enchanting
   The wind carries the fragrance of Kunda and Mandara flowers
   For the blesseds Vaikuntha is the ideal place to reside.    [Note: For
   mumukshu-s and Sannyasins the shaastra forbids contact with
   ‘srak-chandana-vanita’ [flower/garlands, sandal frangrance and women.]


     31. Madhva Guru roared like a lion with his commentaries

                                                             The jackals who
   argued for Mayavada became impotent

                                      Their pride was shattered, they were
   mortally scared

            They thought that it was time to leave the country

                                                              They scattered
   in ten directions, vowed to fight back

                                            As they abused the righteous their
   faces became black.

            Om Tat sat
