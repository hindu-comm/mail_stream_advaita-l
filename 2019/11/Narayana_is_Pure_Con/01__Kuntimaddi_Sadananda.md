Subbuji - PraNAms
I heard a shorter version of this.naraanaam ayanam yasya saH naarayanaH -1. One who is the shelter for all naraas -meaning, human beings.2. ra apparently has a meaning of that which gets destroyed. na ra is that which does not get destroyed - essentially 'souls', in a general sense. One can say - chit swaruupa aatmaa.He is the shelter or He who gives the shelter for all the souls that surrender.
There may be other meanings.
Hari Om!Sadananda

 Here is a reference to the term 'Narayana': “नराणां समूहो नारं तत्रायनं
स्थानं यस्य नारायणः रेफात् परनकारस्य णत्वविधानात् सर्व्वप्राणिबुद्धि-
गुहानिवासाच्छुद्धचैतन्यमित्यर्थः ।” इति शङ्कर- विजये नवमप्रकरणम् ।)

Will anyone please look up the Shankaravijaya (not sure which one) and take
out the context and present here along with the commentary? In the
Narayanasukta bhashya, Sayana has said that this is not any particular
formed deity but the Jagat adhishthana tattvam.

Thanks.

subbu
