I am glad to know Sringeri Math, Bengaluru is the venue for the shodashi
(or something equivalent to that) of Swamini ji. Given her reverence and
seva rendered unto Sri Mahasannidhanam.

Another testimony perhaps to the fine balance the Sringeri tradition
maintains between orthodoxy and flexibility when it comes to customs.
Excessive rigidity would lead to the Sanatana Dharma too falling in to the
trap of the quest for ostensibly purer and purer absolutist adherence to
customs a la the Islamic tradition. ( which successively declares their own
sects and subsects as deviant blasphemers until only the Salafis are left
as Muslims and everyone else is committing blasphemy to various degrees.)
Excessive flexibility in customs on the other hand  leads to a 'sab kuch
chalta hai' attitude which is also a problem. It needs a lot of 'kaushalam'
to find the balance.

Om
Raghav
