I reckon the issue here is more of a general and not about any individual.  The issue that needs to be cleared here is whether traditional mutts have the flexibility to entertain these type of debatable issues that too when the 'vidhi' in smruti with regard to these issues  is unambiguous. And if this flexibility allowed only to other institutions (like  gurukula / Ashrama-s) and their teachers are honored  then it is not clear why this relaxation is not adopted within the orthodox peetha-s.  And if these practices are strictly prohibited irrespective of desha / kAla then why Amnaya mutts are not insisting these instituions and their teachers to adhere to 'dharma vidhi' ??  vedAnta and veda/dharma vidhi are completely in different domains to conclude that to pursue vedAnta studies and vedAnta prachAra,  veda / dharma injunctions and prohibitions are not so important or mandatory to follow??  When I met one  Vaishya sanyasi in kAryAlaya few years back  he said Vaishya sanyasi-s are not allowed to take part in vidvat sadas at shringeri, I don’t know how far it is true as I don’t know anything about  traditional restrictions being followed at Amnaya mutts  to actively participate in vedAnta vidvat sadas.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
