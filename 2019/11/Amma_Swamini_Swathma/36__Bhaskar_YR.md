praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji

Thanks for the clarification Sri Subbu prabhuji.  Whether there is any provision to take the veda and vedAnta /shAstra adhyayana in Sringeri by aspirants including women who are other than brAhmins ??  I think I had asked this doubt earlier also, sorry I forgot whether you replied.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

I reckon the issue here is more of a general and not about any individual.  The issue that needs to be cleared here is whether traditional mutts have the flexibility to entertain these type of debatable issues that too when the 'vidhi' in smruti with regard to these issues  is unambiguous. And if this flexibility allowed only to other institutions (like  gurukula / Ashrama-s) and their teachers are honored  then it is not clear why this relaxation is not adopted within the orthodox peetha-s.  And if these practices are strictly prohibited irrespective of desha / kAla then why Amnaya mutts are not insisting these instituions and their teachers to adhere to 'dharma vidhi' ??  vedAnta and veda/dharma vidhi are completely in different domains to conclude that to pursue vedAnta studies and vedAnta prachAra,  veda / dharma injunctions and prohibitions are not so important or mandatory to follow??  When I met one  Vaishya sanyasi in kAryAlaya few years back  he said Vaishya sanyasi-s are not allowed to take part in vidvat sadas at shringeri, I don’t know how far it is true as I don’t know anything about  traditional restrictions being followed at Amnaya mutts  to actively participate in vedAnta vidvat sadas.


Bhaskar ji,

I have myself been witness to a few Vakyartha Sadas in Sringeri during the earlier Jagadguru when every year two scholars in Nyaya from Kerala used to participate. They were not Brahmins; maybe Kshatriyas or something else. There would be a separate mat on which they would sit and participate.

Also, just a couple of years ago, in Purna Prajna Vidya Peetha, Bengaluru, there was a sadas where the main party was Jain. He was extremely learned in Nyaya and their texts and he was given a separate corner and a Table upon which he sat. His disciples and other laukika Jains, Marwaris, etc. sat on the floor. At a distance the Madhva scholars sat and a full day discussion, completely in Sanskrit ensued. I attended the meet. The Jain swami in his address requested the Madhva party to come to his mutt in Akkipet for another session.  And the Madhvas went there.  He released some books too.

So, these are all permitted in the present orthodox set up.  A few years ago a young Brahmachari stayed in Sringeri for over five years and was groomed to become peethadheesha for the Haldipur MaTha.  I think it is vaishya matha. I have interacted with him then and after sannyasa, he visited Bangalore matha and I met him again there. There is a Tirukkoilur mutt of Chettiars in TN and for over 200 years they have close connection with Sringeri Peetham.

regards
subbu

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
