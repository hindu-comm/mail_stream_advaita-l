My pranams and shraddhanjali to Amma Swamini Swatmabodhananada ji.

I had the good opportunity to know her as Smt. Lakshmi Muthuswami from a
few years before she was given sannyasa. She was always amiable, cheerful,
ready to help, approachable for new students and deeply committed to
Advaita shAstra adhyayanam. Her presence will be deeply missed.

Swamini ji had stayed some years in Sringeri before returning to Bangalore.


Om
Raghav
