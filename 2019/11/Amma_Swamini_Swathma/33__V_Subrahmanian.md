The Taittiriya Upanishad says:  When in doubt as to how to go about in
conduct or karma,  'do as the noble persons in your place and time.'   This
is the guidance of the Upanishads that supersedes all talks, injunctions,
etc.  The latter are only general guides whereas the specific guide is the
above Taittiriya vakya.
