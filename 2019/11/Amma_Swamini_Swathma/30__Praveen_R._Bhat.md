Divine Life Society (DLS)/ Swami Shivanandaji Maharaj (SS) was a pioneer in
initiating women and foreigners into sannyAsa. I recall an incident quoted
by one Swamini Amma at DLS, Rishikesh. SS had asked to write a book on Yoga
while she was really an expert on Vedanta and not Yoga! By the time she
finished the book, SS had attained mahAsamAdhi and she approached HH
Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji for blessings. There she boldly told HH
that even if orthodoxy may not agree, she considers herself as a sannyAsI
belonging to the Sringeri tradition as SS was initiated by a sannyAsI of
the Sringeri tradition. HH said that he appreciated her courage and a wrote
a foreword to her book.

SS used to initiate people into sannyAsa even on postcard! When asked as to
this unheard-of way to initiate people into sannyAsa, he simply said
something to the effect so: there is a traditional view that mokSha is not
possible without sannyAsa and I do not want to deny the possibility of that
to anyone.

Kind rgds,
