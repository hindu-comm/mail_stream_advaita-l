Jijnaasu  accorded priority

Here is an incident recorded in the book 'The Multifaceted Jivanmukta':

His Holiness accorded high priority to spiritual aspirants. An Italian came
to Sringeri in November 1974, hoping to receive some clarifications
regarding Gauḍapādācārya’s Kārikas on the Māṇḍūkyaupaniṣad. However, His
Holiness was rather busy at that time; He was to accomplish
‘śiṣya-svīkāra (initiating a disciple into saṁnyāsa and nominating him as
His successor-designate)’ on 11th November. Hence, it was felt that it
would be impossible for
the foreign aspirant to have a private audience with His Holiness. Yet,
when he made a request to His Holiness, He readily consented to spare time
for him and, with Sri D. S. Subbaramaiyya acting as an interpreter,
answered his questions and resolved his doubts. On being asked about this,
His Holiness said, “He is sincere and has come all the way to India to
learn. It is my duty to provide him clarifications and, hence, obligatory
on me to spare time for him.”

On another occasion, three brahmacārins from North India came to Sringeri
to have His
Holiness’s darśana and obtain spiritual guidance and blessings for their
spiritual progress from Him. It was around 6.40 in the evening when they
reached Narasimhavana. As His Holiness had finished granting audience that
evening and was to proceed for His evening bath in a few minutes, His
attendant was hesitant to inform Him about their arrival. His Holiness,
however, specifically asked him, “Has anybody come for darśana now?” The
attendant answered in the affirmative. “Usher them in,” ordered His
Holiness. Accordingly, the brahmacārins were led upstairs to the
presence of His Holiness. They prostrated before Him. He gestured to them
to sit down. After asking them, in Hindi, where they were from, He asked
them the purpose of their visit. They said that they were interested in
progressing in the spiritual path and reverentially posed their questions.
His Holiness began His reply in right earnest. Since He chose to give
elaborate answers, it was around 7.15 p.m.
before the first of their major questions was dealt with. As was his duty,
the attendant came and informed His Holiness the time, by way of
indicating that it was getting late for His Holiness (who, after His
evening bath and āhnika normally commenced His Candramaulīśvara-pūjā in
public around 8 p.m.). His Holiness continued as if no interruption
had taken place. The spiritual question-and-answer session progressed, with
both the enquirers and His Holiness fully engrossed in it. Time passed on
and at 8 p.m., the attendant again made his appearance, only to be waved
off. It was around 9 p.m. before  His Holiness finished answering all their
questions. He then gave them His complete
blessings and prasāda. They were visibly overjoyed and expressed their
gratitude.
They left spiritually charged, with joyful hearts and fond memories. I was
present
during the discussion and, in the middle of it, His Holiness had turned to
me and said,
“How sincere they are! It is delightful to be of some help to them. It does
not matter
however much my bath is delayed. Their requirements deserve top priority.”
