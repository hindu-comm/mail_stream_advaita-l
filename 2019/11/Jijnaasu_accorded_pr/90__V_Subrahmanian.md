True. It seems that when He was taking classes, he would not impose
stringent rules as to who should attend and who should not. He would say
'For the IAS, many thousands write the exam and a much less number make it

way, even if a few attain to the knowledge of the truth finally by
attending the classes, that is certainly laudable.'
