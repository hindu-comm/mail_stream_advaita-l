Namaste Subbu-ji,

Shri. Abhinava Vidya Tirtha Mahaswamigal was very broad-minded and was very
compassionate at heart.

My sanskrit teacher did his Ph.D and Shri.VR Ramachandra Sastry (father of Gowrishankar) 
was the thesis guide.  During his stay in Sringeri, attending attended Brahma Sutra Bhashya 
& Vishnu Sahasranama Bhashya classes of Shri. Abhinava Vidya Tirtha Swamigal. 

During VS Bhashya class, brahmins were made to sit in front row and shUdrAs at the back
row. When somebody pointed out the reason for this, His Holiness mentioned as

"श्रावयेत् चतुरो वर्णान् कृत्वा ब्राह्मणानाम् अग्रतः"

On another instance, when BSB was underway, Swamigal skipped 
some portions of अपशूद्राधिकरणम् and got upset when 
somebody pointed out at the 'objectionable dharma sutra'.

His Holiness was Compassion, personified and was very magnanimous. 

rgs,
sriram
