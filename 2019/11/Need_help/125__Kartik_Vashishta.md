OM
OM NAMAH SIVANANDAYA

Hari OM!

Revered selves,

Sadar Pranam,

I have always got good advise and suggestions from this group, and I
reverentially salute you all.

By the grace of Guru/God, I am interested in reading the blessed Sri Shiv
Puran. By the grace of God/Guru, I could find the right set of books to
purchase (this list guided me).

As I opened the book, the first word that I read was "PISCHASA".

How to avoid any negative vibes and create the correct atmosphere for
beginning a study of the blessed Sri Shiv Puran?

Pranam,

OM
Kartik Vashishta
