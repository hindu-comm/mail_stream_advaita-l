A Bauddha tenet that Shankara agrees as acceptable

In the BSB 2.2.19, dealing with the Bauddha darshana, Shankara lists the
causal factors that lead to samsara and its perpetuation as per their
doctrine and says that 'certainly these are acceptable not just to the
Bauddha but to all schools without refuting':

ते चाविद्यादयः — अविद्या संस्कारः विज्ञानं नाम रूपं षडायतनं स्पर्शः वेदना
तृष्णा उपादानं भवः जातिः जरा मरणं शोकः परिदेवना दुःखं दुर्मनस्ता —
इत्येवंजातीयका इतरेतरहेतुकाः सौगते समये क्वचित्संक्षिप्ता निर्दिष्टाः,
क्वचित्प्रपञ्चिताः ; सर्वेषामप्ययमविद्यादिकलापोऽप्रत्याख्येयः

The maxim 'paramatam apratiShiddham anumatam bhavati' stated by Shankara
himself (that which is non-contradictory in the opponent school is
admissible to us).  Shankara has paid due credit to Sankhya, Vaisheshika,
Pancharatra, etc. wherever their tenet/contribution is acceptable to
Vedantins.

[It was the eminent scholar Vidwan Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal that drew my
attention to this specific instance some time back.]

In a recent Vakyartha on Nyaya at Sringeri, I discovered that the above
maxim is present in the Nyaya shaastra.
