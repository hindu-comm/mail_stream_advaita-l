Namaste Chandramouli ji
Thanks for pointing out that I had not sent it to the forum.
Regarding AtmA which is alupta-dRk, you indicated that it is not the sAxI
for the GYAna vRtti (for even the vRtti vyApti aspect)? Because of absence
of phala vyApti? Can you clarify and elaborate why "AtmA is sAxI for all
manovRttis except the GYAna vRtti" - my reading of what you are trying to
say - kindly correct me if I understand you incorrectly ?
