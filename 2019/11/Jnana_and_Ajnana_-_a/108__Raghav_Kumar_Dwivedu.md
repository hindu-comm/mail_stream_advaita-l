Namaste Chandramouli ji
I meant Atma as GYAna svarUpam is the sAxI for both aGYAnam as well as all
other vRttis including even the GYAna vRtti for that matter (which does not
need phala vyApti as pointed out by Sada-ji).

The phrase "being unopposed to" is relevant only to the peculiar fact the
GYAnam (AtmA) is unopposed to aGYAnam.

On a different note-
I am not sure how other teachers who regard aGYAnam is abhAvam reason out
this idea of aGYAnena AvRtam GYAnam. One scholar once mentioned that if
*only* bhAShya is studied and no relevant prakaraNa granthas like vedAnta
paribhAShA etc are studied , then pramANa shAstra basics will not be
clearly understood and so statements like "the sAxI *intuits*  the GYAnam
are made."

Om
Raghav
