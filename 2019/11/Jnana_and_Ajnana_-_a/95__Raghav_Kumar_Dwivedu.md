Namaste Subbuji
Thanks for sharing that. Is it a dialogue with the Paramacharya of Kanchi
H.H. Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswati Swamiji? An excerpt from a book?

Regarding the content about the distinction between GYAnam and GYAna vRtti
, with the latter alone being effectual in destroying aGYAnam while the
former being the very svarUpam if Atma merely illuminates both aGYAnam and
is not opposed to it per se, the following question arises.

There is view which was expressed earlier by a respected scholar on this
forum that the GYAna vRttis are sought to be continually cultivated even
for the 'higher order' of GYAnIs because there is a possibility of cyuti or
slippage even for them. So there is no respite. A kind of eternal vigilance
has to be maintained as the price of liberty. This is one viewpoint.

Is there any 'order' of GYAni for whom we can very literally assert that
sarvathA vartamAnopi he never slips or is vulnerable to a cyuti because he
has attained (understood) non-difference with GYAnam as Atma svarUpam? My
understanding is yes. But wanted to clarify this further.

Thank you
Om
Raghav
