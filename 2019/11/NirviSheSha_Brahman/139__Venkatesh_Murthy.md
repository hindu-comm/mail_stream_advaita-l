Namaste

If we want to separate something say a bird from rest of creation we will
give the separating Viseshas. It has wings and flies and lives in a nest in
a tree and so on.

But for Brahman we cannot separate it from Creation at all. Why? Sarvam
Khalvidam Brahma. Brahman is everything in the world. It cannot be
separated from the other objects in the world. Therefore there are no
Viseshas for Brahman. It is Nirvisesha.
