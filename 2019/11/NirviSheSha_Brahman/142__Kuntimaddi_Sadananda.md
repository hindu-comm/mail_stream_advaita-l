Bhaskarji - PraNAms
Here is my understanding.
The thoughtless mind is just a thoughtless mind.
Just as one cannot see or recognize pure light without some object reflecting that light, the same way pure light of consciousness cannot be seen (or recognized) without a reflecting medium. It is similar to looking at the moon on a full-moon night (by the by, the moon is the presiding deity of the mind), one has to recognize the presence of the light which is appearing as the reflected moon-light. Without the moon, present, one cannot see or recognize the presence of the sunlight where the moon is. Today I was checking that as it was a full-moon night.
Nirvikalpa is nothing but empty-mind. But chidaabhaasa or reflected consciousness is there. The mind has to look at its own (reflected) light of consciousness (chidaabhaasa) and recognize or realize the pure all-pervading consciousness that is enlivening that thoughtless mind. It is the mind that has to recognize since it is the mind that has wrong notions that it is an independent conscious entity.
One need not eliminate the thoughts. Even the thoughts are seen since the light of consciousness is getting reflected by them - Hence Kena says -pratibodha viditam matam - it can be recognized in every thought.
By definition brahman being infinite is always nirvishesha. Hence visheshaas only adhyaasa and realization is the recognition of this fact. adhyaasa can only be eliminated by right knowledge. Nothing to remove but something to understand.
Just my 2c.
Hari Om!Sadananda

 Thoughtless mind (nirvikalpa mana as attained in nirvikalpa samAdhi / when there is no thoughts mind itself is not there because without thoughts there is no existence for mind says ramaNa somewhere ) and controlling the thoughts (chitta vrutti nirOdha) are not the 'direct means' mind with viveka / jnana earned through shravaNAdi sAdhana loses its independent existence becomes Atman says kArika. When mind become parishuddha with the sAdhana the mind realizes that there is no question of reaching the brahman because there is no one in bondage, no one who makes an effort to get free, no one is longing for release and none that has become free...and that is the absolute and ultimate truth ðŸ˜Š 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
