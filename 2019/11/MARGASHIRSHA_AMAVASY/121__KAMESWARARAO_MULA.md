Dear Members,
                        Margashirsha month is full of devotion  and dedication to Lord Vishnu as he himself declared once that of all the months Margasishra is dearer to him (Gita:10.35-समस्त महीनों में मैं मार्गशीर्ष (अगहन) तथा समस्त ऋतुओं में फूल खिलने वाली वसन्त रितु हूँ ).There is a great importance of Lord Krishna in this month. Visiting and performing Tarpan at religious places is considered favorable in this month. It is believed that performing pitra puja on this month gives peace and salvation to the soul of ancestors. Those who were not able to perform shraddha can do tarpan on the amavasya of this month for salvation of dead ancestors.

As per the ancient scriptures, it is very important to please dead ancestors before the almighty god. People who have pitra dosha in their kundali, devoid of pleasure of a child, or when Rahu is debilitated in the ninth house should definitely observe fast on this amavasya. Fulfillment of this fast gives desirable results. According to Vishnu purana, by observing this fast all the deities Lord Brahma, Indra, Rudra, Ashwini kumar, Surya, Agni, birds, animals, and evils can be pleased along with dead ancestors by observing this fast.

In Satyug, Devas considered the first day of Margashirsha month to be the beginning of the year. During this month, baths should be taken in rivers and Tulsi and roots of Tulsi plant should be used. Namo Narayanaya mantra or Gayatri mantra should be recited while taking a bath. Devotees can be seen involved in Bhajans, Kirtans etc. throughout this month. There are rallies of these devotees which can be seen early morning during this month.

This month is related to the onset of Mrigasira star. According to the astrologers, the purnima tithi of this month begins from Mrigashira nakshatra. This is the reason why this month is known as Margashirsha maas. This month is also known as Magsar, Agahan and Agrahayan. 

Dattatreya Jayanti Margashirsha Purnima is also celebrated as Dattatreya Jayanti. It is believed that Lord Dattatreya was born on this day. According to religious texts, Lord Dattatreya is known as an incarnation of all Lord Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh. Dattatreya is believed to possess qualities of both the Lord and the Master and hence is also known as Gurudevadatta.
According to beliefs, Dattatreya was born on the day of Purnima in Margashirsha month during Pradosh Kal. According to Shrimad Bhagvatgita, Dattatreya acquired knowledge from 24 masters. Datta community originated because of him. Many different temples devoted to him can be seen in southern India. Worshipping Lord Dattatreya on the Purnima of Margashirsha month relieves a person from all problems and sins.

Margashirsha (Agnahan) Amavasya Significance: Today  (26/11/19)here it is  is margasirsha amvasya but as per our tradition it is Kartik Amavasya. Like every Amavasya, Pitru Puja is also performed on Margashirsha Amavasya. However,Pitru Tarpan, Shraddh are considered highly auspicious and offer pious rewards to the devotees and their ancestors. Tila Tarpan and Pind Daan helps one’s ancestors attain liberation and peace in the afterlife. Also, fasting on Margashirsha Amavasya removes all the sins and brings peace and prosperity in the life of the devotees.

I would like to know from the learned where these both amvaya/purnima calendas differ or merger on the same point. One home work I did which is of my interest and I will put it here.

KALASTAMI (KALABHIRAVA JAYANTHI)  falls on the eighth lunar day (ashtami) in the fortnight of the waning moon (Krishna Paksha) in the Kartika masa (per the South Indian Amavasyant calendar, every month ends with a new moon) or Magrashirsha (per the North Indian Purnima calendar, every month ends with a full moon). 
By both calendars, Bhairava Ashtami falls on the same day in November–December
