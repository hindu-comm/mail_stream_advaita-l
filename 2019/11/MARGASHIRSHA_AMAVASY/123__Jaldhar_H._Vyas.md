Yes this is correct.  As to why Krishna Bhagavan considers Margashirasa to 
be His svarupa, I gave my opinion on this in the list some time back. 
For Shrautis, (those Brahmanas who still practice nitya agnihotra and 
other Vedic yajnas) Agrahayaneshti on Margashirasa Purnima is the 
beginning of the yearly cycle of naimittika yajnas.  As Vishnu Bhagavana 
is the embodiment of yajna (Yagnapurusha or Yagnanarayana) it is fitting 
that He should be Margashirasa amongst the months.
