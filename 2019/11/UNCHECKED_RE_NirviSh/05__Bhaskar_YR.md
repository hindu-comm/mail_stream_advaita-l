Similarly, Atman is like matter (padardham), It can't be destroyed, but can be changed from one form to another form.

There cannot be 'svagata bedha' in brahman, neha nAnAsti kiMchana says Upanishad. Hence vivartOpadAna kAraNa has been attributed to brahman in Advaita.   Though changing kArya is nothing but kAraNa, the kAraNa is NOT kArya, bhAshyakAra is quite clear when clarifying : ananyatvepi kAryakAraNayOH, kAryasya kAraNAtmatvaM 'NA TU KAARANASYA KAARYAATMATVAM' (sUtra bhAshya).  There is no change possible for RING (kArya)  without the existence of GOLD (kAraNa) in it.   But GOLD is always GOLD irrespective of ring becoming necklace or bangle.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
