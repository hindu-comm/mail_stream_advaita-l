In the Soundharya  Lahari composed by Sri Bhagavath Padhal there is a reference to Himself .Dravida Sishu word is employed by Him in one of the stanzas which is considered as a reference to Himself.But some say it refers to Thiru Jnana Sambandhar.If it is taken to refer to Him then it can  mean what you are saying.
