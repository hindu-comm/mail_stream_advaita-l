For the word 'avishesha' in the above shloka, Sridhara Swamin says:
shuddhah, paramaatmaa, tvam brahmaadi ruupascha tvameva. [Nirvishesha Brahman are you and also the one with the forms of Brahmaa, etc.]

Hare Krishna

Yes, there is nothing apart from HIM hence in Advaita vedAnta it is said he is abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNa.  Not only brahman is brahmA, vishNu, maheshwara he is sakalaM/sarvaM, sakala charAchara jagat pratishTa.  When he is each and everything what can separate (vishesha) its presence??  HE is in aNu, reNu, truNa, kAshta, HE is mahat (aNoraNeeyAn mahatO maheeyAn says upanishat.  Hence he is vishesha rahita i.e. nirvishesha.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
