Raam raam
Sri maha periyava charanam.
The text maharnava karma vipabhaga was published by vaidika vardhini kmu.
The text was published in grantha script and few copies are there with some
of the vaidikas. Heard that the people from Pune took the task of
publishing it in Devanagari lipi. But not sure that effort succeeded or not.
But I have so far seen grantha script version.

There is another text known as karma vibhaga available in archive.org but
that different from what is from kmu version.

Thanks

Sri maha periyava charanam
