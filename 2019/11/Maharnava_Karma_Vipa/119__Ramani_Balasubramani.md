Namaste,
You are correct that what is there in archives.org is different from what I am looking for.If you know any scholar who could show me the text , would appreciate. I do not know to read lipi. I need it in Sanskrit .

Raam raamSri maha periyava charanam.The text maharnava karma vipabhaga was published by vaidika vardhini kmu.The text was published in grantha script and few copies are there with some of the vaidikas. Heard that the people from Pune took the task of publishing it in Devanagari lipi. But not sure that effort succeeded or not.But I have so far seen grantha script version.
There is another text known as karma vibhaga available in archive.org but that different from what is from kmu version.
Thanks

Hello,
I am looking for the text titled Maharnava Karma Vipakam. If any body could point to a Sanskrit version of the text, would appreciate the same.
Thanks
