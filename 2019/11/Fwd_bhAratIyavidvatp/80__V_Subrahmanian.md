Bhāṣā Viveka: Comprehending the intricacies of Interpreting Sanskrit

by Hariprasad Nellitheertha November 26, 2019

Conclusion

The process of analyzing and interpreting the sacred works of *śāstra* and
Sanskrit literature is multi-layered. A thorough knowledge of the wider set
of *grantha*s, along with the know-how of the various instruments of
interpretation is very essential. *Bhāṣā*, *rīti*, and *bheda* are some of
the useful tools in this journey. One cannot interpret or teach *śāstra* with
just the knowledge of language. A lifelong indulgence in the practice of
*Sanātana* *Dharma* is critical for success in any such endeavor.
