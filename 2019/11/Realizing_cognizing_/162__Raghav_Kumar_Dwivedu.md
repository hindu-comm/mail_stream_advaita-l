Also i request you to appreciate that many members who "write profusely" on
this forum who "call themselves sampradAyavits" as you put it, greatly
revere all the later Acharyas of the tradition too like Sri Vidyaranya and
Sri Madhusudana Saraswati. For some of the "call-themselves-sampradAyavit"
members,  the tough tarka based prakaraNa granthas too are a matter for
adhyayanam with shraddhA. It brings them greater clarity and precision.
Even if all do not feel the need for such study, it's to be respected and
the shraddhA and ekAgratA that such study fosters, is quite in order.
