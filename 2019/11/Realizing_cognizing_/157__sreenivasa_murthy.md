Dear friends,
The following mantras points out the true svarupa of Atman :satyam jnamanantam brahma || taittariya upanishad.brahmaivEdagm sarvam ayamAtmA brahma || MandukyaSAntaM Sivam advaitaM caturtham manyantE sa AtmA sa vijnEyaH ||Mandukya
Sri Shankara says :paramAtmA hi sarvEShAm AtmA || commentary to mantra 2-4-6 of Bruhadaranyaka.AtmA hi nAma svarUpam || commentary to Sutra 1-1-6.
Mantra 4-4-23 of Bruhadaranyaks 4-4-23 reads thus : AtmanyEvAtmAnaM paSyati ||In the commentary to the above Sloka Sri Shankara writes : Atmani svE kAryakaraNasaMGAtE Eva AtmAnaM pratyakcEtayitAraM paSyati ||
>From the above Sruti mantras and Sri Shankara's upadESathe following conclusions emerge out : One's own true svarUpa is advaitam and 
 it has to be cognized / realized within himself 
 HERE and Now.
I humbly request the eminent scholars / readers who profusely 
write about Vedanta to let this undersigned mumukShu to know,based on their own interiorization of them, how to cognize these upadeSas within himself(in other words, he is that advaitatattva itself). 
I will be deeply indebted to all for their immense help.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
