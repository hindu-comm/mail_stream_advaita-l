If we want to separate something say a bird from rest of creation we will
give the separating Viseshas. It has wings and flies and lives in a nest in
a tree and so on.

But for Brahman we cannot separate it from Creation at all. Why? Sarvam
Khalvidam Brahma. Brahman is everything in the world. It cannot be
separated from the other objects in the world. Therefore there are no
Viseshas for Brahman. It is Nirvisesha.

MrthyJi! Nice Explanation for Nirvisesha Brahmman

Similarly, Atman is like matter (padardham), It can't be destroyed, but can be changed from one form to another form.  Nothing can be separated from it and whosoever walks on the advaitic path towards reaching brahmman should keep their soul intact with their preceptor/guru/ananda bhirava.

Some time back Bhaskar ji nicely explained about Sarvam Khalvidam Brahmasi.

As you said it can't be separated from other objects (say materialistic things) and Hence No vishesha for Brhamman.

Once Acharya Sadanandaji wrote me that the ananda of Brahmma is also limited (countable)

To reach Atman, Brahmman, Guru's Lotus feet, one has to work in Nature.

I feet it can't be expressed or write or put it on papter rather it has to be experienced.

One of my elders said to me that : Srituality has to be experience and you can share any thing to any body, but we should not reveal the atman experience to any one , it has to be realized.
