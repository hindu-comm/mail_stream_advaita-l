Given the apathy of Advaitins for such meets, one can only hope to see a
very thin participation/attendance from Advaitins. The crowd will be from
the general public and Madhvas. Such is the sorry state of affairs when it
comes to such things.  Many youngsters who are interested in such meets
apply leave on that day and come.
