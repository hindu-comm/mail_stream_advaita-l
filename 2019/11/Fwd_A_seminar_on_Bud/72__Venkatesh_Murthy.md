Many orthodox people from Advaiti side will not like to go to a Madhva Mutt
and listen to debates. One more point is if a Swamiji asks people will
attend. For Madhvas the Swamiji will be encouraging them to come. The
headquarters of Madhvas is Bengaluru. Many Swamijis live in this city. But
for Advaitis the headquarters is Sringeri. If some debate is arranged in
Sringeri definitely large number of Advaitis will come. Bengaluru has
become Madhvas Fort. They are very strong in this city.
