First of all, Sringeri won't host any such debate. But every year during
Mahaganapathi Sadas at least five scholars come to speak on Advaita.  How
many people from Advaita sampradaya go to attend them? Not even one from
outstation  comes exclusively to listen to them. The audience consists of
only some local people or tourists who get an opportunity to have the
Acharyas' darshan then.  Hardly one or two jijnasus are there.
