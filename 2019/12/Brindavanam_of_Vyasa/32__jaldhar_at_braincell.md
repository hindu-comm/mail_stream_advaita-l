Although I am no fan of Vyastirthas ideas, there is no doubt that he was 
one of the most towering intellects Bharata has produced.

When a diamond is dug out of the ground it has a certain lustre but the 
jeweller with hard grinding tools polishes it and it shines even brighter. 
In the same manner way though Vyastirths attacks on Advaita Vedanta were 
ultimately futile, the power of his arguments forced a response from sages 
such as Swami Madhusudana Saraswati which made Advaita Vedanta shine even 
brighter.

Thus this scurrilous attack should be seen as an insult to the entire 
dharmic world not just the Madhva community.
