Dear colleagues,

Could you please provide me with some material--both in the original and
secondary sources-- on Ramaraya Kavi. I need to prepare an entry for
Bloomsbury Encyclopedia in Indian Philosophy. I only have his
*Siddhantasindhu* and a damaged copy of *Sankara-asankara Vimarsha  *


With regards,
Niranjan Saha
