“People imagine that the devotees crowding around a Jnani get special
favors from him. If a guru shows partiality, how can he be a Jnani? Is he
so foolish as to be flattered by people’s attendance on him and the service
they do? Does distance matter? The guru is pleased with him only who gives
himself up entirely, who abandons his ego forever. Such a man is taken care
of wherever he may be. He need not pray. God looks after him unasked. The
frog lives by the side of the fragrant lotus, but it is the bee who gets
the honey.” -

Reminiscences of Shantammal, Bhagavan's devotee who worked in the Ashram
kitchen.
