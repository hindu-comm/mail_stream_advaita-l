Appealing, exhorting, girls to come forward to  marry Vedic scholars

This scenario is applicable everywhere (not only in Tamil). The present attitude & mentality of the girls is that they are looking only for pink slips & software techies as just they have to think to understand one single fact that when they borned there are no pink salary slips and there  is no softwares (i.e fb's what apps when their parent existed). The vedic scholar are also just like to others who wants to take our cultures, parampara's ahead and they can earn better the present job holders in the future as the time is going to takes its rotation.

so The appeal is correct and Please dont hesitate to marry the vedic scholars.

Sri Guru Padaravindarpana Mastu

 Here is a crisp call to girls and their parents to take forward the Veda
adhyayana parampara. Noted scholar of Vishishtadvaita Sri A.P.N.Swamy
speaks for a few minutes appealing, exhorting, girls to come forward to
marry Vedic scholars. The talk is in Tamil but the message is universal.
Spread the message in many groups, forums, etc.
