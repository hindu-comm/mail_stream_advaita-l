Here is a crisp call to girls and their parents to take forward the Veda
adhyayana parampara.  Noted scholar of Vishishtadvaita Sri A.P.N.Swamy
speaks for a few minutes appealing, exhorting, girls to come forward to
marry Vedic scholars.  The talk is in Tamil but the message is universal.
Spread the message in many groups, forums, etc.
