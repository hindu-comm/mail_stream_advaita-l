Dear friends,siddhAnta and pUrvapakSha, siddhantiand pUrvapakshi 
appear in that non-dual principle which is one without asecond (EkamEvAdvitIyam). They both are the expressions 
of thatPrinciple and hence are that principle only. 
The Principle is one with both itsexpressions /manifestations . 
Even though it is one with them it it isuntouched by them. 
Why 
? Because both are vikarAs and Sruti says"vAcAramBaNaM vikarO 
nAmadhEyam || " (Chandogya.) 
The same Sruti says" AtmatO idagaM sarvam" (Chandogya 7-26-1) and "AtmaivEdadaMsarvam ||" (Chandogya 7-25-2). 
Sri Shankara says "sarvaikatvAt||" (It is one with everything).Where is vivAda and virOdha? 
It is SAntam,Sivam, advaitam.
Sri Shankara writes thus in Upadesasahasri Chapter 218, Soka1 :

 yEnAtmanA vilIyanta udBavantica vRuttayaH |

 nityAvagatayE tasmai namOdhIpratyayAtmane ||

Kindly refer to Shrauta tarka 3 of Sri Shankara which readsthus:

prapaMcasya brahmapraBavatvAtkAryakAraNAnanyanyAyatvEna 

brahmAvyatiriktatvAt || Brahmasutra 2-1-6.


What has been stated above are facts of life which 
can beverified in one's own life.Hence it is avivAdaH and avirOdhaH.
With respectful naskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
