Somaya
------

Advaita-vedanta is the only system that makes sense to me and which I value.
I am a permanent seeker as I don't think I will ever know all that I want to
know. I am a self-taught student of Sanskrit at which I am making slow
progress. My interest is in delving into the original texts to understand
the verses and the beauty of the thought process of the original poet. I am
also a student of the Sri Rudram, having learnt to chant it. I use it as my
text along with my Sanskrit lessons. My goal is to translate the essence of
Sri Rudram into English.

S.V.Manjunath
-------------

I am a male retired government officer aged 61 years.I am interested to
understand,assimilate the advaita vedantha for my spiritual progression with
the firm understanding that advaitha is only universally accepted truth of
the universe.

prakaranas) into spanish language. (ten publications up to date).


Kukkuteswara Rao

and created interest to learn more about Vedanta Philosophy.
