Dear Raghav ji,

I am not aware of the Gaudiya-Brahmasamhita connecton, bond.  Yet, despite
such statements, the Gaudapada Karika 'advaitam paramartho hi dvaitam tad
bheda uchyate'  'maayaamaatram idam dvaitam...' kind of verses can be
interpreted as 'dvaita is uncertain knowledge and advaita is certain
knowledge'.   'Aham Brahma..' can become 'aheyam....'   Not sure if
Gaudiyas too resort to such bizarre interpretations :-)

regards
subbu
