Raghavji,

Namaste. Thanks for your reply.

Unlike the shritis and smriti texts, my understanding is that the purana
texts come with some kind of inherent license for temporal expansions. It
appears to be a common feature for many of the puranas. The process of
expansions is not just insertion and interpolation, but more than that with
a theme and purpose.

Please scroll down the cited page to get to an article titled ' original
purana samhita' that gives an idea about this.

If you Google 'david reigle' and 'puranas', u may find discussions on this
topic in a parallel list that would shed more light.
My reading of swamiji's intro was that there is much more than that catches
the eye and the three stage expansion model appears to be more in line with
the history of other texts.

In another mail, you had made a remark about srithara swamin and his
timing. It is believed he lived after Sri madhwachwrya of dwaita sampradaya
who peaked between 1250s to 1310s. M had written bhagavata tatparya
nirnaya. So SS was not the earliest commentator, as you were asking about.
This is just a food for ur thought. A relevant question to ask would be why
acharya madhwa choose to do this work at par with his Mahabharata and
ramayana tatparya nirnaya works unless it was already a primary text in his
times. He was born 100 years after the siddhi of Sri Ramanuja. I have not
read this work so am not sure which version of bhagavata text he used.

Sincerely,
..gopal
