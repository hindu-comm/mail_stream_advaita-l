 Namaste, Subbuji

> Could the Bhagavata Tatparya Nirnaya be termed a 'commentary' on the
text?  Is BTN a work of verses composed by Madhva or is it a verse-by-verse
commentary like Sridhara Swamin has done?

I do not want to misspeak as I have not read the work in full; just
familiar with some slokas for their meanings and only when they were cited
in talks. But I am appending a page (page 37), vol 1, introduction of the 5
volume work by Late KT Pandurangi's work on this text.  Please see it
attached where he describes about this work. That appears to answer your
question.

Any further details on that, I would be also interested to know:  Prov. V.
Pandurangi  could be of help in this regard and I believe he writes on this
email list also.

Similar to your note on Sridhara Swamin's invocation, there is  another
verse that "shivasya hrudayam vishnO: vishnOscha hrudayam shiva:"... this
sloka has more lines that echo the ekata of the two divinities.
Sincerely
..gopal
