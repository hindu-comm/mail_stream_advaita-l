It may not be out of place here to mention that the Mahabharata too has
undergone such a laundering.  The most recent instance is that of the
'Vaishnava PaaTha' of this text published by the Palimaru MaTha of Udupi
(Madhva following).  They have said there that they have gone by the
Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya of Madhvacharya and the Lakshalankara of
Vadiraja to determine what would have been the intent of Veda Vyasa.
Strange it is, that rather it should have been the opposite : - ).   In
some editions of the MBTN, in places, the editor says, these verses are not
to be found in the printed versions of the MB but since our Acharya has
cited them these must have existed (in older editions).  Verses on Bhima
being extolled as the supreme jiva, with unparalleled prowess, paanDitya,
etc. are not found elsewhere.
