Namaste Gopal ji
 Thanks so much for sharing that pdf. I agree that 'authored' is not the
best word to describe the southern indian origin of the extant version of
the srimad-bhagavatam. I was recollecting from 20 year old memories hence
the imprecision.

Interestingly, Swami Tapasyanandaji while giving much more detail about its
origin also goes on to say (the words are in quotes in your pdf and i am
assuming they are his words) that
"It is evident from this that the (Vaishnava)
Bhagavata, as it exists today, has been *thoroughly revised* by some
unknown savant of South India
imbued with the devotional fervour of the Alwars. Though versions of the
Bhagavata *might have been*
in existence earlier, the *last editor of it must have recast it
radically*."

So 'radical-recaster' or 'thorough-reviser' would be more appropriate to
describe the southern indian scholar who introduced numerous verses of his
own in to a presumably older edition.


Om
Raghav
