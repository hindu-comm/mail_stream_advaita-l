Could the Bhagavata Tatparya Nirnaya be termed a 'commentary' on the text?
Is BTN a work of verses composed by Madhva or is it a verse-by-verse
commentary like Sridhara Swamin has done?

I just wanted to add, in continuation of the observation of Swami
Tapasyananda,  this invocation of Sridhara Swamin to his commentary:

माधवोमाधवावीशौ सर्वसिद्धिविधायिनौ। वन्दे परस्परात्मानौ परस्परनुतिप्रियौ॥

I bow to Mādhava and Umādhava (Shiva) who are both 'Isha-s' Supreme Lords. They
are capable of bestowing all accomplishments (to their devotees). They are
both the selves of each other and both love to engage in the stuti of each
other.
Vamshidhara, the expounder of Sridhara swamin's commentary, explains this
verse with copious citations from scriptural texts. This is available in
the link below:
