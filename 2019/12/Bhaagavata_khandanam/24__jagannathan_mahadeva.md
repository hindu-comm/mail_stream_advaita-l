It must be noted that the srimadbhAgavatam is the source for and finds confirmation in nAraynIyam authored by Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri (1560â€“1666 AD). Legend has it that Lord himself confirmed this in GuruvayUr.

However you should be aware that the factual basis for a lot of these historical opinions is very poor and often based on circular logic.  E.g. "Shankaracharya did not quote the Bhagavata.  Why?  It was not extent in his time." and "Bhagavata was not extent in the time of Shankaracharya? Why? He did not quote from it." etc.
