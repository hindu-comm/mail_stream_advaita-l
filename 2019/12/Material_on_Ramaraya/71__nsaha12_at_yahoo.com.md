 Dear colleagues,
Could you please provide me with some material--both in the original and secondary sources-- on Ramaraya Kavi. I need to prepare an entry for Bloomsbury Encyclopedia in Indian Philosophy. I only have his Siddhantasindhu and a damaged copy of Sankara-asankara Vimarsha

With regards,Niranjan Saha
