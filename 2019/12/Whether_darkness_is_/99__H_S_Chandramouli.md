 Namaste  Sudhanshu  Ji,

Reg  the question you had posed to me at the following reference

<< https://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2019-May/052145.html
>>

Which I am copying below

<< What is the pramana for the following?

Darkness is not bhAva, it is bhAvarUpa. It is not a vastu  to be termed

bhAva. But since it conceals bhAvAs, it is termed bhAvarUpa.

Chitsukhi clearly articulates darkness as द्रव्यान्तर. I quote --

"तमालश्यामलज्ञाने निर्बाधे जाग्रति स्फुटे। द्रव्यान्तर तमः कस्मात् अकस्मात्

अपलप्यते।।" It goes on to prove darkness as द्रव्यान्तर through various

Logic >>,

I recently came across the following in Sidhanta Bindu of Sri Madhusudhana
Saraswati

<< एवमविध्यात एवान्धकारोपि भावरॄप एवावरणात्मा चाक्षुषज्ञानविरोधी
आलोकनाश्यश्च झटिति महाविध्युदादिवदाविर्भवति तिरोभवति चेति सिद्धान्तः ॥ >>

<< evamavidhyAta evAndhakAropi bhAvarRRIpa evAvaraNAtmA
chAkShuShaj~nAnavirodhI AlokanAshyashcha jhaTiti
mahAvidhyudAdivadAvirbhavati tirobhavati cheti siddhAntaH || >>

Sri MS uses the word अन्धकार (andhakAra) itself meaning darkness instead of
the word tamas which could have different meanings depending upon context.

I am not sure if this meets with your requirement. If not please ignore
this post. I am not trying to reopen the debate. Only  responding to your
specific query.
Regards
