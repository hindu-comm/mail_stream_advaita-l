praNAms
Hare Krishna

Today I have come across an interesting comment by Swamy DS  about prakaraNa JMV through  one of the ardent followers of Arsha Vidya gurukulam.  Before sharing the same would like to know how this text / prakaraNa be treated in Arsha vidya gurukulam.  And Yati dharma text as well.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
