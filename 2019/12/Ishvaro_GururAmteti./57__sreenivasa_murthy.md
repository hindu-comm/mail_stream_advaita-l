 Dear Sri Sriram, अद्वैतमेव सिद्धांतः|  
very beautufully put!Advaita is not only a mere siddhAmta, or mere words , 
but also it is the vastu (BUtavastu) which is the 
Self / Atman of all of us.
This is What Acharya Shankara exhorts the mumukshu 
who is the student of Vedanta to 
realize this truth within oneself by oneself.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
