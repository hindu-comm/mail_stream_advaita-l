The Consort of Lord Arunachala of Tiruvannamalai temple is called
'Apeeta-kuchaambaal' which means 'One whose breasts have not been sucked.'
Recently Br.Sri Balaji Bhagavatar, in a discourse gave this explanation for
the above:

The Mother blesses the devotee in such a way that there will be no more
occasion to suck the mother's breast' in the sense that there will be no
birth henceforth.

She thus confers liberation on the devotee.

An explanation I had not heard before.
