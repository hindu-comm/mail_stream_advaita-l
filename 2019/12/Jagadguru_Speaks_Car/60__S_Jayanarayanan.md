Regardless of man's progress in life, his happiness is determined
chiefly by his control over the indriyas and ability to remain
contented with detachment towards the world of objects. No
matter how attractive worldly objects appear, he must remain
ever firm in the belief that such objects are illusory.

Needless to say, one who remains with such conviction will
hardly suffer under any circumstance. To live in such manner, the
blessing of "Jnana Guru" (realised Master) is of utmost importance.

It is also essential for every one to understand from the Guru the
prescribed means to evolve in life: The sadhanas to follow with the
ordained karmas and the extent to which they must be performed.
These observances will bestow contentment and happiness. 

In the absence of restraints, man will only fritter away his life
without any direction. Losing control over his senses and
harbouring attachment towards worldly objects, he will engage in
unrighteous acts and get caught in the cycle of suffering. Our
forefathers have instructed:

  दरिद्रो यस्त्वसन्तुष्टः कृपणो योऽजितेन्द्रियः ।
  गुणेष्वसक्तधीरीशो गुणसङ्गो विपर्ययः ॥

  { This is from the Srimad Bhagavatam 11.19.44:
  https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_purana/bhagpur-11.html?lang=en-IN }

Only an unhappy person is poor, not the one bereft of wealth.
Likewise, he who has not conquered his indriyas is pitiable, not
the poor. Unattached to objects, he is free, but if attached to them
he remains in bondage.

Our blessings for everyone to understand this well, nurture a
mind that does not crave for worldly things, but perform all
ordained duties as an offering to God.
