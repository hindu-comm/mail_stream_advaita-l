I saw in the recent past many people joining the list with a keen interest
to learn about advaita-vedanta.

The following URL points to an article in The Hindu where there is a
one-page narrative which tries to put the entire content of scriptures in
the right perspective.  It talks about Guru-shishya parampara, the karma and
jnAna kANDa and the place of devotion in understanding the vision of the
scriptures.
