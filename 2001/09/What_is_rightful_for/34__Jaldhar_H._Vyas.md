Manusmrti and other shastras are quite clear that perfect ahimsa is not
possible.  (That's why nityakarmas like panchamahayajnas are ordained as
prayaschitta for the minor acts of himsa we inadvertantly commit every
day.) And yet those same shastras do ask us to pursue ahimsa.  Contradiction?
No.  The absence of perfection does not excuse us from trying to be
perfect because what is the alternative?  The US government as you state
has the duty to protect its' people and seek justice.  It cannot shirk
that duty out of fear of the consequences.  Arjuna is the one in the
Bhagavadgita who makes arguments for ahimsa, for sharing and compromise etc..
Yet Krishna Bhagawan dismisses such arguments because in the name of
avoiding relatively minor evils, such feelings would have allowed a
greater evil to flourish.  Unfortunately we are dealing with cowards who
hide amongst the innocent. That puts the blood of such innocents on
their hands not the US.  Having said that, I am aware that unlike the days
of bow and arrows where a misplaced shot could kill one innocent person,
we now have weapons of mass distruction.  So the US must be careful not to
use them recklessly.  But again, prudence should not give way to paralysis.
