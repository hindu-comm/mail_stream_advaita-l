Namaste all,
May I extend the original idea on the 'ether' to
include the space within the molecular structure of
the pot. Where is any division of this space, is it
not just a continual flow; within, without now have no
meaning?
If there is no division can there be a relationship
between the pot and the 'ether'?
Is there a point of contact?
If there is, what happens to the point of contact when
the pot breaks and is pulverised?
I think that the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 9, has some
interesting discussion on this.
Maybe I am missing some information re. relationship,
if so please direct me to relevant texts,
Many thanks
Ken Knight
