I received the following mail sometime back. This text is attributed to
shankara. Earlier only a translation of this was available from Trevor
Leggett (very pricey, over 200 USD). Now there is an inexpensive
edition of this text by Prof. Rukmani and it has the original text of
both the vivaraNa and the bhAshhya with English translation.


You can look at Prof. TS Rukmani's CV at

namaaskaram.
 This topic reminds me of a discourse of Sri
Anantharama dikshidhar where he is talking about Shri
Shankara's description of "maraNam" - death. According
to Shri Shankara, "maraNam" is the time when we cannot
remember "smaraNam" the Lord at all. So, taken
literelly, this means that every minute we are not
thinking of BhagavAn is death. The greater danger here
is that the actual act of death can happen during one
of these moments of forgetting the Lord ...
 Also, during the discourse, Shri Dikshidhar mentions
that if one dies, then one can use some arguments
against Yama and "win" the privilege of being born a
human again. Two of the most potent arguments include
(a) chanting the Gayathri and (b) listening to the
shrimad bhagavatam/raamaayaNam/mahaa bhaaratam. He
mentions (elsewhere) references in the Shiva PuraNam
which clearly says that even if one is not able to
understand the meaning of the gayathri when one is
actually chanting, it should atleast be done
methodically; the reason even this methodical
application will have an effect is much like a
medicine taken by one who does not believe it will
help him. Whether the consumer of the medicine likes
it or, believes it or not etc, the medicine will do
it's job, namely saving the patient. So also with the
gayathri. This is one of the reasons why our ancient
rishis in their great wisdom have made a rule that we
should chant the gayathri in the three sandhis of
every day, so that when the great sandhi comes, that
of life meeting death, we will hopefuly be equipped
enough to do the same, namely, chant the gayathri and
redeem ourselves.

bhava shankara desikame sharaNam
Vaidya.
