Dear Subrahmanian,
Thanks. But, the word "Brahmana" is a synonym for goodness. Our thoughts
should do some good to whole mankaind. Please be in touch,
regards
Shridhar

Dear Sir

I am a French yoga-teacher who lives near Rennes (the main town of Brittany,
west part of France).
In 1977, 1998 and 1999, I travelled to India to study yoga and vedanta
philosophy. During theses tours,  I met in Bangalore a well trained disciple
of Swami Satchidanandendra (from Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya) whose name was
Shri Devarao Kulkarni. Under this guidance, I studied the Sankara's
prasthana traya bashya as explained by his own guru. After that, I wrote a
thesis on avastha traya viveka and I am now doctor in Indian Philosophy from
the French University of Lyon.

As I have seen on your web site the name of Swami Satchidanandendra, (the
guru of my guru) and though my English is not very good, I am quite
interested in trying to follow the discussion of your Advaita-L...
