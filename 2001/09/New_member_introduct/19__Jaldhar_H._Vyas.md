Sri Gitaya namah

Dear Administrators & Readers

I had the pleasure being a follower of the Advaita-L up to May. But had
to stop for a while, because of a new ADSL connection.
As a translator I worked on a new Dutch translation of the Bhagavad
Gita, which was published in 1992.
To do a such a job can be done by reflecting on the text. Although I can
read sanskrit, I translated the Gita using several bi-lingual editions.
Sanskrit-English that is. In matters of doubt, I could refer to
Monnier-Williams' Dictionary for clarification.
At the moment I am very much interested in the functioning of the gunas
in nature and in daily life.
I would be pleased to dive into the wealth of knowledge which is made
available here by all those revered contributors.
Om Tat Sat
