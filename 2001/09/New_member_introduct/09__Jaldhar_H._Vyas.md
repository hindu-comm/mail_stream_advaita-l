I'm a student in college and have been reading Swami Vivekananda since I was
14. After hearing and reading about various schools of thought (Dvaita,
Advaita, Vaishnavism, etc) Advaita has made the most sense to me so far. I'd
like to be a member of this group to increase my knowledge about
advaita-vedanta.

Sunny Bhardwaj
