Sorry for the trouble but at some time today the machine hosting
advaita-vedanta.org is moving to a new IP address.  This means there might
be a day or so of disruption as your computers think it is two places at
once.  After the move is done, I'm also going to redo the mail setup to
finally squash the problems some people have been having once and for all.
