Sri Jaldhar,

My mails keep bouncing back, even though I have
"ADVAITA-L at LISTS.ADVAITA-VEDANTA.ORG" as the address.  If this does not show
up in the list, kindly forward it and correct my account if there is any
error.

>Yes, there is this intention in the Digvijaya, to convey this moral.

The PATH of jnAna is opposed to the PATH of karma is advaita-vedanta's view
point.

But jnAna as the end/goal is independent and inspite of karma.  karmaNA na
vardhate na xIyate (brahman neither grows nor decays by performance of
karma).  For a jivanmuktha who is the end goal himself, the performance of
karma (action) does not alter his abidance in the Self.

In tatvabodha Sri Shankara while talking about the 3 karmas of a jivanmukta
says:  The sanchita karma is destroyed the moment there is self-knowledge.
The AgAmi karma is dispensed to other jivas who either praise him (punya) or
ridicule him (papa).  But even the jivanmuktha will have to undergo his
prarabda karma that is left from previous birth.  So a lot of jivanmuktha's
acting like normal men has its basis in the last of the above 3 mentioned.

Ofcourse, I don't wish to hurt the sentiments of those who believe Shankara
is an avatar and hence has no prarabda karma.  I was just explaining the
post-self-knowledge actions of jivan muktas.

Regards,
SVS.

Namaste,

My name is Bhavani Manickam (31 years of age), I am a Malaysian of Indian
origin (Tamil) residing in Kuala Lumpur. I am a lawyer by profession but I
have ceased practice as I was not very happy doing what I was doing...I
didn't particularly like the anxiety, stress and the long working hours
that came with the job. Right now, I am a Trade Officer (not using my
degree at all) at the Brazilian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. I only work from
8.30 a.m till about 2 p.m, that' s just half a day (five day week), my
work's challenging enough, I work with diplomats and I AM STRESS FREE.
Because I have alot of free time on my hands, i've been doing things that
I've been meaning to do for a long time. I've completed my yoga course,
joined the gym, am attending Bhagavad Gita classes at the temple, doing
service and been reading a lot. I am actually having fun and I wouldn't
trade it for anything at the moment, i love my lifestyle.

I really enjoy my Gita classes, I've never read it b4 and i really like
the knowledge that i extract from there. i've been making a conscious
effort to be more soul-conscious than body-conscious, and  it has also got
me interested in finding out more about the other Vedic scriptures. I
stumbled on to your site when I was surfing the net and I thought it would
be a good idea to join. I hope i'd be allowed to join the list. Think I
have said enough about myself. Hope to hear from you soon.

Hare Krishna,
Bhavani
