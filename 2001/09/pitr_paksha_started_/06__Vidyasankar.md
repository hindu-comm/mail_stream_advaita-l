Yes, there is this intention in the Digvijaya, to convey this moral.

There is another aspect to remember. The monk, whether a vidvat sannyAsin
or a vividishA sannyAsin, has to at least take a bath when his mother
passes away. It is only an extension to actually perfom the cremation
rituals too. The sannyAsa rules allow for exceptions in cases where no
other male relation can be found to do them. So, although it may not have
been necessary for Sankaracharya to perform any rituals, he would have done
it to set the example for future generations to follow.
