AUM shivAbhyAnnamaH

This comes in ardhanArishvara stotram. I posted an translation of this
to ambaa-L as well as advaita-L.  This is text by shankara and it is in
the 1st volume of collected works.

http://www.ambaa.org/stotrams/ardhanari.htm

Later I found a better translation by svAmi shivAnanda at

http://www.svbf.org/sringeri/journal/vol2no1/index.html

Hope this helps. Officially I have taken permission to post what is in
the journal paramArtha tattvam  to advaita-L. Only requirements are we
should cite the URL and not change the material (except formatting it
for text email). But since I have little time, I am not doing that.
