anubhava or experience makes the knowledge direct. Without that reading or
hearing stands at theoretical level. To have the anubhava one must have the
right background and be in the right setting. When we read/hear without
these, that knowledge gained is incomplete. OTOH, guru ensures that these
requirements are met, that is why when he/she says something to his/her
disciple, it becomes fruitful quickly.
