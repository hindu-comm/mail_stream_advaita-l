Oh I didn't mean to imply that there is only one valid response.
Different people will take different amounts of time to recover.  But they
should try their hardest to return to normal for everyones sakes including
their own.

All souls are a spark of the divine.  It may not seem appropriate for me
to say this, I know some people around me who would be upset to hear me
talk like this but even the terrorists were not other than God.  Our
religion is very clear on this point.  But saying this does not excuse
their culpability for evil in any way.  The presence of God is obscured by
maya.  The root cause of maya is ignorance.  Compare the terrorists with
the firemen.  Both groups were unselfish.  Both groups were willing to lay
down their lives for their cause.  The difference was the firefighters
made no distinction between "us" and "them."  The terrorists only saw
"them."  It is this blindness which makes their selflessness evil and the
firefighters selflessness good.  As for the victims they too suffered from
ignorance but of a more prosaic kind -- simple lack of data.  Who could
imagine something as terrible as flying a plane into a building?  A few
days after, my wife said something that chilled me to the bone.
Apparently after the first plane crashed into WTC 1, there was an
announcement about it and a _voluntary_ evacuation was suggested for
people in WTC 2.  My wife and her colleagues spent _five_minutes_ looking
out of the window and discussing before proceeding downstairs.  If they
had waited five minutes more...?  Or "voluntarily" choosing to continue
their work?  I can't bear to think of the outcome.

Gandhiji was not an Advaitin but we would concur with such an explanation.
And knowing it, we should resolve to try and combat ignorance wherever we
find it.
