[Subject changed to something more descriptive.  I never heard from anyone
else with mail problems.  Shall I conclude it was a false alarm?]

My wife was on the 78th floor of WTC 2.  She made it out safely but It was
another 24 hours before she was able to come home because of the military
curfew.  On Tuesday I was on the Internet all day because it was the only
open channel of communication but since then I've been too distracted.
In retrospect that is a bad thing, what the terrorists want more than
anything is for us to change our lives and give up our freedom.  By
continuing as normally as possible, we are denying them victory.

Bhagawan in not a puppetmaster.  He has endowed His creations with free
will hopefully to do good, but, alas, sometimes to do evil.  The
terrorists will reap the fruits of their own actions.

English lacks a formal neuter gender like some Indian languages.  His can
apply to neuter as well as masculine nouns.  Nowadays some people object
to that but the alternatives "his or her" or "it" do not sound right.
Language should be beautiful as well as functional.  Perhaps one should
just alternate between "his" and "her"?

This only applies to God in the abstract.  Our various Devas and Devis do
have a definite gender so the choice is clear cut in those cases.
