I am glad to know you (and presumably others on the list) are unhurt,
physically at least.

Yes, I should have changed the subject line, and I apologize for the
oversight.

That was close, particularly since that came down first! It must have been
very painful. And she probably personally knows so many who did nor make
it.

I could not agree with you more, but we do have a limit to our
capabilities.

He may or may not be - we do not know. It hurts when we think of Him as an
uncaring, reckless puppetmaster, but that is only because we are
attributing our values to Him. And there are several other questions: How
free is free will? From whose perspective do we label good and evil? Surely
the religion of the Vedas and the Gita knows better than to shy away from
accepting that there is a limit to what an ordinary human may understand of
why things happen as they do. To my understanding, death and destruction
are not looked upon as undesireable in the philosophical sense. No
religion, including the Vedic,  would condone senseless killing - but that
is as a guideline to potential perpetrators of such acts in day-to-day
life. What explanation does it offer to the victims or observers? That He
absolves Himself of responsibility for what is happening on this earth
since He has given us free will? That the terrorists will suffer in their
next birth? I am not so sure that the explanations are all that lame. But I
may be wrong - I am not a scholar of Vedanta.

In any case, my comments were more in the spirit of what Gandhiji, perhaps
one of the greatest Karma Yogis of our times, meant when he said that there
is not a blade of grass that moves without His express will. I find deep
strength in that explanation.

My heartfelt sympathies to all those who have suffered in the tragedy. Wish
I could do something to mitigate the pain.
