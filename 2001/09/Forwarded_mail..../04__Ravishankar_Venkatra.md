It is said that when someone gets initiated into sanyasa ashrama, 21
generations of his paternal and maternal ancestors (pitrus) are sent to
Brahmaloka. It is equivalent to saying following a karma for becoming a
sanyasi (like tonsure, kaashaaya vastram, kamandalam and dhandam). I do not
know whether this is true about a brahma jnani who is not initiated into
sanyasa. Maybe you are right because because a brahmajnani is a sanyasi
anyway, irrrespective of what he wears or follows.
