Why go to these?  We have situations in RamayaNa and Mahabharata.

Compare Kumbhakarna and Vibhishana - who is dharmic?
Compare Vidura and Drona/Bhishma - who is dharmic?

Moral dilemma has been there right from age old times.  Each one has to resolve
it with the help of a Guru and study of scriptures.

SVS.
