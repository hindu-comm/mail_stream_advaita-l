Subject: Re: Where do they belong?


This subject matter is outside the scope of the list. Here we are
interested in matter pertaining to vedAnta and we will better off doing
aatma vichaara rather than doing an enquiry on what goes on a
terrorist's mind.

Please note that  there  are plenty of other forums to agitate your
mind on this material. And certainly this does not belong here.
