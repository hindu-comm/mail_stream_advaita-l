Hey.............c'mon ! You are outright audacious now !!
How can u say that these books are of dubious value? Have u read them? If
not, how can u comment on them? Its because of people like u that India has
been trampled upon, plundered and humiliated for more than a millenium.
You cannot establish the Principles of Advaita Vedanta where Sanatana Dharma
is not flourishing. Reading shastras and teachings of Sadgurus when your
temples are being desecrated, your womenfolk molested, your resources
plundered will not help u. How can u follow the teachings when the
atmosphere for practice of these tenets is lost? I advise u to visit this
site and read all the books available and then come to a conclusion.

Regards
Anand K
