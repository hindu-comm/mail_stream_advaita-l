NO!  This a trap we absolutely must not fall into.  For one thing, as was
earlier pointed out we have concepts such as holy war too.  For another,
the majority of Muslims -- even fundamentalist ones -- do manage to live
in peace with their neighbors.  When we start looking over our shoulders
at what other people are doing instead of examining how well we are
following our own beliefs, we risk becoming chauvinists no better than
those we look down upon. .  Ravi is right, let us concentrate on
understanding ourselves and our doctrines first.

If you have spare time to read, spend it on reading shastras or the
teachings of our sadgurus instead of items of dubious value like these.
