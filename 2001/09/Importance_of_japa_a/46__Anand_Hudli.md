The R^igvidhAna of Shaunaka is a practical manual that describes the
situations and the mantras of the R^igveda that are to be employed in
them.

Shaunaka makes this point in 1.9:

xatriyo bAhuvIryeNa taredApadamAtmanaH |
dhanena vaishyashUdrau tu japahomairdvijottamaH ||

A KShatriya should cross over his calamity by valor (strength of
the arms), while a vaishya or shUdra by means of wealth. However,
the best of the dvijas (ie. a brAhmaNa) (should overcome any
calamity) by japa and homa.

Anand
