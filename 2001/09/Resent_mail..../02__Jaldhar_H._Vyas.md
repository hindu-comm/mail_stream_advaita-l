Dear Shri. Jaldhar Vyas,

Re: Sankaracharya performing mother's shraddha

There is an opinion that when a descendent becomes a brahma jnani the
descendent's pitrs automatically obtain liberation or the required lokas and
no further shraddhas are needed. So Sankara's mother had already obtained
what needs to be obtained when Sankara got brahma jnanam. In a way
Sankaracharya's action is redundant from this angle.

Did you hear such view?

Regards
Bhadraiah
