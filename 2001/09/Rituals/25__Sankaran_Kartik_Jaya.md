I agree that karma as enjoined by the Vedas alone does not include all
obligatory duty. But how does one know what one's obligatory duty is?

The answer is in BG 16.24: "One must therefore heed the shastras
(scriptures) in ascertaining what should be done. Accepting the authority
of the shastras, perform the prescribed action!"

I understand that performing action in this world by going to the office
etc. and working with detachment may lead to purification of the mind, but
this is certainly not what is commanded by the shastras, and cannot
compare with the purification of the mind that is acquired by simply
following the scriptural injunctions with devotion.

In "Dialogues with the Guru", H.H. Chandrashekhara Bharati says precisely
that.

But your advice is for people like me, I presume :-)
