Yes it is.  Advaita Vedanta is not just about philosophy but a way of
life.  How to act or not to act are very important.

They are misinterpreting what the shastras say about the Kaliyuga.  What
is different now is the quantity not the quality of Dharma.  Dharma is
sanatana (eternal.)  I think this view of North Indian Vaishnavas is based
on historical circumstances.  The Vedic tradition in the north suffered
grieviously due to invasions,opportunism etc.  Vallabhacharya had to flee
Vrindavan eventually ending up in Rajasthan.  Two of Chaitanyas six main
followers were convertsto Islam at one point.  This lead to a defeatist
attitude.  But we should remember that Time is maya.  Maya is totally
under our control.  In fact we must try and control it for it is the deeds
of the virtuous people of the Kaliyuga which will cause the next
satyayuga.  This cycle of yugas continues indefinitely.  The India which
was dominated by foreign powers doesn't exist.  Today who is stopping us
from following our Dharma?

In fact the Vedic Shrauta yajnas are not a thing of the past.  They
continue to this very day.  (A list member said a soma yajna took place
earlier this year in Andhra Pradesh.)  Those who practice the Grhya rites
number in the tens of thousands.  I won;t lie to you.  Yes following
Dharma can be difficult, I can tell you that from my personal experience.
But things like mathematics are difficult too.  No none suggests we
abandon them and only chant the name of Pythagoras do they?
