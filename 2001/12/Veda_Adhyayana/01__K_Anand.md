Dear Learned members,

I would like to do Veda Adyayanam of my Shaka (Yajus) in Madras city. Can any list member suggest me a suitable Guru or Ganapatigal or Patasala which they know of and where they are ready to take people who want to learn Vedas for fear of acquiring Dhaurbrahmanyam?

Thanks in advance,

with best regards,
Anand K
