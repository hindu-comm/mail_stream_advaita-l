Well, as I mentioned, the crucial difference is that in Samkhya/Yoga, the
goal is merely freedom from material constraints (of which the mental
concepts are just the most subtle kind.)  On liberation a jiva just kind
of floats there while the world continues on its' merry way.

In Advaita Vedanta, the goal is total unity.  Between the jiva and the
world and between all the other jivas.  This is why samadhi is not enough
by itself.  Maya is held at bay but it is still "out there."  only when it
too is understood as being not other than the atman is there moksha.

Also, let me again state that this is a comparioson of the "classic"
samkhya/yoga and Advaita Vedanta.  Even then as all astika darshanas are
based on the Vedas, there was some similarity in concepts and goals.  In
later times it was absorbed into Advaita Vedanta so later writers may
indeed use certain terms interchangeably.

        Introduction of Hemant Kapoor
[ - - - ]
                       My brief introduction is as follows. I am 31.I am a
bachelor. I belong to a kshatriya family of north India. I have a masters
degree in Chemistry from IIT Kanpur ( '89 batch JEE) I am presently
settled in Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry. A proper grasp of the Advaita parampara is necessary for a full understanding of Sri Aurobindo's philosophical
position. With this end in mind I
have enlisted myself in this mailing list. I agree to abide by all the
rules of the list.
              I am fairly new to the life of Sadhana. I welcome insights
from senior sadhaks irrespective of denomination.

                                                         Sincerely,
                                                       Hemant Kapoor
