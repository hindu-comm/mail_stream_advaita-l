Thanks to ShrI Balasubramaniam for his reply. I would like
to further clarify my question. Isn't nirvikalpa samAdhi
and
turIya the same thing the difference being only in the
terminology ( samAdhi is yoga while turIya is advaita
vedAnta )? Also, is the yogic kaivalya the same as jnAna?

Thanks,

-Vivek.
