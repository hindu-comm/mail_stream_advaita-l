While what you say about the Ishwara is true, it has to be recognised that Ishwara in SAnkar adwaita is, in the final analysis
a product of Maya although the first product. Thus immanence etc. of the Divine is, from the point of view of the ultimate reality an Illusion. The Taittiriya Upanisad makes it plain. The knower of the Brahman it declares, does not care much about sin or even virtue.
