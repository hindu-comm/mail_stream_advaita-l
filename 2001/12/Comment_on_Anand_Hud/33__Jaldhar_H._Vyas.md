Not caring about the effect of karma is not the same as not being affected
by it.  Regardless of how much of a jnani he thinks he is, a person who
acts in an egotistical way will suffer the consequences of it.  This is
why Advaita Vedanta says sannyasa is a necessary step for any serious
sadhana.  Otherwise it is like the person who says "i will not get wet"
while standing in a river!
