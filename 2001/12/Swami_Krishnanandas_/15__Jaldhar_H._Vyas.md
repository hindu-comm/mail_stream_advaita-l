Blessed Self,
A short note has been posted at Sri Swami Krishnanandaji Maharaj's
website regarding Swamiji's premonition of his Mahasamadhi along with
a description of the Mahasamadhi ceremonies. This is at:
http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/mahasamadhi.html

Sri Swamiji dictated his autobiography earlier this year and in that
he says:
My Life - Autobiography at:
http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/aubio/mylife_1.html
I have learned the art of Total Thinking. For me there is only One
Thought and every thought is included in it. Everyone's thought
is a part of that thought. I tried to think as God would think. What
would God think about his creation? Would he have loves and hatreds
for some part of his creation? Loving God would mean loving the whole
creation. This thought is called meditation. Now the time has come
for me to enter into the Virat Purusha who is seeing me with His all
eyes, through all His heads, - Sahasrasirsha Purusha.

He subsequently resigned as General Secretary and Trustee of
The Divine Life Society in September.

A guestbook is present at Sri Swamiji's site it is at:
http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/guestbook.html

Several items were posted at Swamiji's site during the past two
weeks. They are:
1) Zip download of Sri Swamiji's book "The Yoga System":
http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/yoga_00.html

2) Four video clips from Sadhana Week on July 26, 1994:

3) A discourse titled "Fundamentals of the Yoga System of Patanjali"
http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/disc/disc_38.html

Pranam

OM

 Why should his doing something saintly in the past, stop him from
undergoing an experience corresponding to the past Karma that he
committed at t-20, unless hes really Liberated and Realized at time  t ?
If at t, because his k=4910,would the action that he committed that
brought initially his count from 10 to -90 be taken off his account
(because of his doing something saintly at t-30) ? If so, how is this justifiable ?

 Shri Vaidya Sundaram explained these points in his last mail in
detail. Still, at the end, the relation between fate and freewill
 seems to be confusing to me, if we take up the above example of
burying something in the past with some strictly unacceptable motive
and digging it up now by exercising one's freewill in the right
direction with repeated attempts aiming at achieving the treasure.

Recently my friend told "Dont confuse with your fate and freewill.
Leave everything to His Freewill."  It was quite punching.
