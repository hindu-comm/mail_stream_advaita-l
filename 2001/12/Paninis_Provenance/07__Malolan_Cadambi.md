I wish to know more about the provenance of Panini. I have come across
incorporation of chandas and other aspects of paninian grammar in the vedas.

By the way Prasad, Ralph Griffith lists atleast 58 types of chandas in his
translation of the Rig Veda.

Does this imply that panini exsisted before the "composition" of the vedas?
