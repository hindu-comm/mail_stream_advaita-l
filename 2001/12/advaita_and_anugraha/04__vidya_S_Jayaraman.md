Shankara speaks of anugraha in several places.
Anugraha and gurutatva makes perfect sense from a
siddhanta saiva or vishishtadvaita angle.Could someone
explain anugraha and guru tatva from an advaita angle
or give some pointers to resources.

Also Many advaitins were also shrividya upasakas.
AFAIK shrividya seems to have small differences from
advaita.How are these reconciled?
