Namaste:

Arsha Vidya Gurukulam offeres Vedanta Retreat courses offer a systematic way
of learning Vedanta including Sanskrit. The duration varies depending on how
much depth one wants to learn.  The two-month course during October/November
is ideal if time permits.  Details are available at URL:
http://www.arshavidya.org/programs/VedantaCamp.htm

Similar courses are available at Chinmaya Mission and Ramakrishna Mission
both in India and abroad. Summer camps, weeklong retreats and weekend
specials are also available. The acharyas of these missions are always
available to help the interested students with necessary guidelines, books,
tapes etc.

Hari Om!
