I believe it was three.  But I can't immediately recall which ones they
were.

Jaya and Vijaya committed an offence and through their free will chose the
method of atonement for it.

In their Asuric bodies they were deluded and did not remember the choice
they had made.  Their actions were based on the limited lnowledge theyhad
at hand.  Similiarly we all thorough our actions in this life and previous
ones set the course for future events but we are not mindful of all the
details so we think some magical force called "fate" is responsible.

This is why Vedantic sadhana involves careful scrutiny of ones self and
ones own actions/behavior.  We are naturally enveloped in avidya but the
light of self-knowledge can enable us to break through it.
