Funny - I've seen a good english translation there.

The distinction between bhakti and jnaana ultimately rests with self-effort
or surrender. But again even as per Shankara, in the ultimate sense
liberation is only due to grace - so ultimately surrender is inevitable. But
this surrender/bhakti should not be confused with what is commonly
understood as bhakti - as a way of saadhana using the body and mind.
