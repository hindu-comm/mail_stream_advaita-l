This sanskritplay by Krishna mishra of Rajputana is an
allegorical play devoted to the establishment of the
supremacy of jnana as the means to mokshaa and the
dramatis personae include viveka, sradha,karuna
vairagya etc.The negative forces are defeated and
jnana comes out supreme.
Vedanta desika has written the sankalpa suryodaya on
similar lines with bhakti coming out victosious.

I read about this recently .

Would Anyone have any info on the  publication or
availability of this work in print or the net ?
