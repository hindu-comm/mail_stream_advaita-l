Dear Jaldhar,

Do the Shastras also accept anuloma vivaha where the
Kshatriya (or Vaisya) wife of a Brahmin male, to be
the primary and only wife, as long as she is too from
a Dvija (kshatriya or vaisya)family ? It is my
understanding the progeny are Brahmins in the case of
Brahmin male marrying a Kshatriya female.  Richika, a
Brahmin, married Viswamitra's sister a Kshatriya and
their son Jamadagni was a Brahmin who married a
Suryavamshi Kshatriya princess Renuka and they had 4
sons, including Bhagawan Parashurama.  It is my
understanding that a Brahmin male with Sudras,
Panchamas (popularly known as Harijans), Tribals,
mlechas (foreigners) isnt approved of and progeny are
not Brahmins.  Pratiloma vivahas (female is higher
caste than the male) in general are not approved, some
consider a sin, and the progeny are considered sudra
or lower.

Thanks for your upcoming response.

Pranam, Ravi Chandrasekhara MD

In the Manusmrti no.  It would take some research to see if other
smrtikaras differed.

It should be noted that the conduct of Rshis was recognized as being
somewhat anomalous.  In this context you should look at the section of the
Mahabharata where the five Pandavas ask to marry Draupadi.  King Drupada
naturally looks askance at this highly unusual situation and a
conversation ensues with Yudhisthira in which the cases of several Rshis
are mentioned and whether they should be emulated or not is discussed.
(I'm sorry I don't have a copy of the mula Mahabharata handy so I can't
give you the exact reference.)
