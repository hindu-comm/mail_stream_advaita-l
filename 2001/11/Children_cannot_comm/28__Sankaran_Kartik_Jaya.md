It is precisely due to the child's inability to discriminate between right
and wrong that the child cannot commit or incur sin. Below a certain age,
children are not imputable for the actions they commit in ignorance.

Some quotes from "Dialogues with the Guru" by H.H. Chandrashekhara
BharatI:

----------------
H.H: The animals and young children have no conception of right or wrong,
nor have they the ability to form any such conception. With them,
ignorance is inevitable and therefore not a sin. But when a child grows up
and is able to distinguish between right and wrong, he becomes responsible
for his actions and incurs sin if he acts wrongly.
...
H.H: To commit a sin, it is necessary to have the capacity to discriminate
between right and wrong; and this comes only a few years after birth.
----------------

Therefore if a child of say three years accidentally steps onto a roach,
thereby killing it, the child does not sin.

Purificatory rites for the child are incumbent on its parents, and are
performed because the *past adharma* of the child (i.e. in previous
incarnations) can injure the child in its present state. As H.H. says, to
reap the effects of sin, only the capacity to suffer is necessary,
something the child possesses.

Therefore purificatory rites are not performed for the actions of the
child in its present birth, since the child does not incur any sin till it
attains a certain age when awareness of dharma dawns.
