Well I forgot that I posted it to the list.  Even worse is the book
shop. I ordered this book a month back and have not received it yet. I
think that even if this work in not by shankara, it is still worth
studying. PYS is a very valuable tool in the path to realization and it
can interpreted (with some modifications to concepts such as infinite
purushha-s and prakR^iti-s) in an advaitic way. Even for other suutra-s
such as, "vitarka bhAdane pratipaxa bhAvanam" instead of using the
traditional approach to interpret what is pratipaxa, one can derive
that from adhyAsa bhAshya.


I hope this mail will reach advaita-l before the end of this year :-))
