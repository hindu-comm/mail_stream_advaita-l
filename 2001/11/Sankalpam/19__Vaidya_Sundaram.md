 List member Anand Hudli wrote a series of articles to our list with even
psedo code as some real code on how titi's, vara's, nakshatra's etc are
calculated ... I would refer interested list members to this. I am trying to
put up articles of such interesting and recurring nature under easily
accessible links under our web site. Any suggestions from listmembers are
welcome.
