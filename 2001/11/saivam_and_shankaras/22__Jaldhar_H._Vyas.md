The Bhedabhedavadin oponent of Shankaracharya was Bhaskara Mishra who is
different from the Bhaskar you mentioned above.

I can't add anything more than what was mentioned in other posts.

Ok thats interesting.  I didn't know there was this split.  According to
Shiva Purana, Lakulisha is the founder of the Pashupata sampradaya.  In
the sarvadarshanasangrah of Madhavacharya, the chapter on Pashupatas is
called Nakulishapashupatadarshanam.  Judging by the short description
there, some of the distinctive features of this darsha are just variants
on theories held by Vaisheshika and Samkhya.  In that case, Shankaracharya
may not have thought it worth the bother to deal wih them seperately.

Amongst the Astikas, yes.  But the Buddhist and Jain monasticism was
already ancient by that time.

Jainism seems to have been quite influential in South India in early times
until supplanted by Shaivism.  Could that be a link/influence?
