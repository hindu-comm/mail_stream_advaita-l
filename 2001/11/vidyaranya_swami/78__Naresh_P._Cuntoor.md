Namaste,
As I recall, the pillars that Sri Vaidya refers to are still there... Its
in the temple to the right side, after the main (Sharadamba) temple
but before the river, while walking from say, the administrator's office
towards Narasimha vana.
There are also a couple of interesting sculptures there. Within the pillar
is a cavity that contains a stone.. The puzzling thing is the diameter or
the stone is greater than the diameter of the cavity opening.. So how did
the stone get in there?

Namaskaram,
      Thank you for the explanation.  I have a few more questions.

      Lets consider the same example of burying a treasure in the past life and trying to dig up in this life. What if the person who is digging up now , had buried it by exercising his free will in the wrong direction ?  Say, he had acquired the treasure by improper means and wanted to bury it. In that case, why should his digging up in this Jenma forever and for whatever depth, should lead him to the treasure ? If he gets it, then, is it not something that shouldnt happen has happened ? I'm not clear under what conditions this person's, who had buried it with bad intentions, getting the treasure in this jenma or any future jenma will be considered acceptable.
