namaH sarvebhyaH,
        What you are referring to is in the
Vidyashankara temple. That is the temple after the
SharadAmba temple towards the river. This temple
revels in architectural splendor. Refer
www.sringeri.org, the official website of the Sringeri
MaTha.
        I too have heard about the story of Sri
Vidyaranya doing 1000+ gAyatrI every day. But the
identity of shrI vidyAraNya and the mAdhava of the
sAyaNa-mAdhava brothers who wrote the veda-bhAShya, is
under debate. Maybe Vidyashankar can throw some light
on this.

Best,
Raghavendra.
