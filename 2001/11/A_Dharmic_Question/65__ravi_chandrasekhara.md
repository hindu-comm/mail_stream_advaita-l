Pranam to all,

I have read that offspring of Brahman male with a
Vaisya female is either a Brahman or Ambastha; but
offspring of Brahman males and Kshatriya females are
Brahmans similar to savrana vivaha among Brahmans, not
charioters,; but the offspring may have slightly
different rights as opposed to offspring of savarana
marriages among Brahmans. But I think this applies to
whether the female is a primary or secondary wife.
This would be a good question for one of the
Shankaracharyas. Does anyone know if Sri Chandrasekhar
Bharati, the former acharya of Sringeri or Sri
Chandraskerandra Saraswati, the former acharya of
Kanchi have commented on anuloma vivahas ?
