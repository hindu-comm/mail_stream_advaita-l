Hello all:

  My question pertains to the latter part of this thread
- agnihotra.  Are there any nitya agnihotris left in India?
Also, aren't there vidhis that say that one is to "keep"
the fires at all times?  How does one do that in an
apartment in Madras or Manhattan?  Are there list members
who follow this?

Thanks,

-Vivek.
