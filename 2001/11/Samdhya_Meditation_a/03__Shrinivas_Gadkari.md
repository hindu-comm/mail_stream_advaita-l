Namsate:

Some information related to this topic, might be inerest to some
list members.

Shri Sai Baba of Shirdi, had lit up a fire that he kept burning
throughout his life. This fire is continously burning even today.
It is called "Dhuni", and the ash that it produces is the celebrated
"udi". Sai Baba is considered a great agnihotri by his devotees.

Best regards
Shrinivas
