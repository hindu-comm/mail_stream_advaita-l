May be a couple of hundred or less.  Mostly in the south of India.  Though
I'm told Goswami Gokulotsavaji, one of the leaders of Vallabhacharyas
sampradaya is a nitya agnihotri (and a learned pandit and a noted singer
of Hindustani sangit.)  He lives in Indore, MP.  There have been in recent
times agnihotris in Kashi, and Gujarat.

Usually by Agnihotra one means the Shrauta agnihotra.  According to the
Grhyasutras there is also the Vaishvadeva homa, that grhasthas should
daily.  But to my knowledge all these rituals require owning your own home
so apartment dwellers are out of luck..
