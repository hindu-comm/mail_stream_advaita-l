Here is my translation.

Neither there is dissolution nor creation. Neither there is a bonded
man nor one striving to break the bonds. Neither there is anybody
aspiring for liberation nor one that is liberated. This is the ultimate
understanding.

According to gauDapAda the whole question of WHY comes if you
admit that there is creation. But is there creation? According to him
in the ultimate analysis there is none. It is called ajAti vAda.

regards,

Sarma.
