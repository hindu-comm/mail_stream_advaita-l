but surely, when Sankaracharya has quoted certain upanishads (even though
they are not one of the 10 principal upanishads), like the paingala
upanishad or the jabala upanishad, it should be given more weight, since
he is anterior to the other commentators, unlike Sri Madhvacharya who was
born 400 years or more after Sankaracharya. Is there any interpretation
or commentary to the paingala upanishad (which mentions adhyaropa
apavada) from the vishishtadvaita or dvaita side?
