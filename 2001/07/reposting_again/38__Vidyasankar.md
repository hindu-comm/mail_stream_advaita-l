I am a little confused about the above. Is the claim that mAyA is
postulated because of Sruti-based anupalabdhi pramANa, or is it
that the appearance of jagat is based on the anupalabdhi?

Note that mAyA as triguNAtmikA prakRti is mentioned throughout gItA.
It is not something new invented by Sankaracarya or borrowed from
some Buddhist school. If any other school is to be identified in this
context, we have to look for prakRti according to sAMkhya and/or yoga.
