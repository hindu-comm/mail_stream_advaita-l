I know that is a problem, but it seems to me that in debates between
two traditional schools of thought, we have to do the following -

1. give up the modern scholarly idea of what constitues textual
   authenticity and age,
2. use an intersection set (not a union set) of the texts referenced
   by the established authors of the two schools in question,
3. keep out perspectives from a third school of thought.

1 ensures that we tackle the traditions on their own terms.
2 ensures that we have a set of references that has to be acceptable
  to both sides of the discussion. The intersection set between the
  sources explicitly used by Sankara and Ramanuja is definitely greater
  than the major Upanishad texts.
3 ensures that we decompose a complex multi-body problem into simpler
  two-body problems, so to speak. Of course, the debate between dvaita
  and advaita is as interesting as (or perhaps more than) the debate
  between viSishTAdvaita and advaita, but we must remember that there
  is also a debate between viSishTAdvaita and dvaita in the background.

The Comans translation-cum-commentary was published in 1988, by Satguru
Publications, Delhi. There is an earlier private edition of the Sanskrit
original from Bombay, in 1975.
