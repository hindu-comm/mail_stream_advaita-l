Vidya -

Implication, as I understand, is the use of  maaya as sadasat
vilakshaNa is shruti based anupaladbi rather than directly shruti
statements to that effect.

In B.G geeta - my recollection is maaya  is used in reference to
parameswara shakti but not in the sense of sat asat vilakshaNa.
daiviim esha guNamayi mama maayaa durathyayaa.  I am not sure if
there is any  specific references to maaya in the sense it is defined
in advaitic traditions in Giita either.    Equation of maaya to
prakR^iti we have to go back again to the referenced swataaswatara
Upanishad statement.

Am I wrong?

Hari Om!
