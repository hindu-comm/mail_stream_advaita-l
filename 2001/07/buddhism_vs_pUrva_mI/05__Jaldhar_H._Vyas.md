But that's only on the surface, because Advaita is Veda-anta. Since it
is an interpreter of the Veda, Advaita has to accept the validity of
the Vedic teachings at some level. The karma-kaanda is restricted only
to the sphere of developing chitta shuddi, while the jnaana kaanda's
utility is accepted at an "instructional" level at attaining brahman.
But by denying even jnaana-kaanda ultimate validity and placing even
its teachings in the realm of ignorance (it is in the realm of
ignorance because all teachings are at best - words and ideas -
they're not the thing-in-itself - they're not brahman), Shankara has
overturned the assumptions of the Miimaamsakas for whom Veda has
ultimate validity in all aspects of life.
