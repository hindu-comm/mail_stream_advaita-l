If you look carefully, Advaita Vedanta accepts many Purva Mimamsa tenets
in toto.  Specifically what it rejects is the Mimamsaka idea that the
ultimate goal of life is Heaven achieved by performance of Karmas.  That
goal is ok for ordinary people but the wise man should go beyond that.
So it is not so much that Advaita Vedanta defeats Purva Mimamsa, but
sidesteps it.  Many of the famous later Mimamsakas were also Advaitins.
