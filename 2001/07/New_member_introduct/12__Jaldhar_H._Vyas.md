Hello,

My name is Avi, I've all my life was interested in one way or the other in
eastern philosophy. I have started meditating years ago using
Transcendental Meditation technique and go to be familiar with allot of
the vedAnta terms and concepts. As my interest grew I found your list on
gogle while searching for advaita-vedAnta.

namaste,

-Avi
