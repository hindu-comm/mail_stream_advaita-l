Namaskaram
I saw this in the archives on yahoo groups, but not on our list server.
Hence I am resending this ... actually, there seem to be several posts
missing from one which is there in another, both ways.
Just as a reminder, I request all members that they post only to our
server address namely, advaila-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org and not on our
yahoo groups since we are trying to maintain that only as a back up.
Unfortunately, with the server crash in the recent past, there seem to be
a lot of mis match between the different archives in terms of postings, as
well as ,membership. If you think you have the time to check on what is
missing, please fell free to do that and drop an email to us at
listmaster at lists.advaita-vedanta.org.
Thank you.

Hi.  I just wanted to drop a note thanking you for posting my
introduction to the group.

However, I also must apologize.  For some reason, I had this group in
the "no email" status, (which I have immediately changed, so that I
can get all of the emails that are posted).  I'm not sure how this
happened -- I guess I need to get used to this "Yahoo Groups" thing.

At any rate, if any of you have sent a post responding to my
introduction, I have not received it.  I just checked the archives,
and there doesn't seem to be anything posted for today, but I just
wanted to make sure.

In my introduction, I had asked if any of you may wish to recommend a
book which could help me to learn more about Advaita Vedanta.  I have
read some works in the past, but it was a while ago, and I'm very
interested in learning how to apply this philosophy to my life.  I
would also love to know how some of you have applied this to your
daily life.

Thanks again!!!
All my best,
Artemis
