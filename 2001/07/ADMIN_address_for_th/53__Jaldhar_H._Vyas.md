No please don't.  The correct address for the list is:

advaita-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org

(You forgot the 'lists' part.)

In other news, if you tried to post and got an error saying "554 Relay
access denied", that was due to an overly aggressive spam filter on my
mail server.  I've made changes that should improve things for you.
Please repost and let me know if you still get bounces.
