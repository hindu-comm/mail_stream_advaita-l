Actually, there is a whole lot of research on the various senses in
which the word mAyA has been used in the advaita tradition. It seems
to me that Sankara Bhagavatpada uses the word mAyA very much in the
same sense that is intended in "indro mAyAbhiH pururUpa Iyate". Of
course, a quick check in the SAnkarabhAshya on Br. Up. should clarify
how the AcArya himself interprets this Rk quotation (as Shrisha has
rightly pointed out).

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
