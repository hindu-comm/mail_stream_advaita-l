I was wondering whether the common descriptions of brahman and moksha
according to other vedantic systems exist in the upanishads. For example, do
the words "nitya kainkaryam" or "ananta kalyana guna" which are used in
Vishishtadvaita to describe moksha and brahman respectively, occur
anywhere in the Sruti? I request members to clarify.
