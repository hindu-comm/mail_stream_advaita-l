Yesteday Shreeman S.M.S. Chari mentioned in his lectures that the
word Maya and nirguNa each one occurs only ones in the upanishat -

He quoted the Swe. Up. sloka - maayantu prakR^itim vidyaat ... that
we are familiar.
ARe there any other references to Maya word in other upanishats and
also for nirguNa? Vidya are you there?

Hari Om!
