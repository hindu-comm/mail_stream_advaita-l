He's wrong, at least if his own tradition be believed.  There is also the
verse:

  anAdimAyayA supto yadA jIvaH prabuddhyate  |
  ajamanidramasvapnaM advaitaM buddhyate tadA  ||

This is considered to be a kArikA of Gaudapada according to modern Advaita
tradition, and the citation of the same by Shankara in his BSBh. is
perhaps ambivalent.  However, Ramanuja himself quotes the first hemistich
as Shruti (`jIvasyaiva hi mAyayA nirodhaH shrUyate').

`teshhAmasau virajo brahmaloko na yeshhu jihmamanR^itaM na mAyA cheti'
(1.16).

The mahAnArAyaNa has it as `tAn.h yaj~nasya mAyayA sarvAn.h avayajAmahe'.

That is a quoted Rk; there are many others where mAyA is used; e.g.,
`indro mahAM sindhuM AshayAnaM mAyAvinaM vR^itraM asphuranniH' (2.11.09).
`pra mAyAbhir.h mAyinA bhUtamatra nArA nR^itU janiman.h yaj~niyAnAm.h'
(6.63.05).

Concerning this issue, my friend dr.Paul van Oyen wrote the following
personal letter to His Holiness, hereby published with permission. While
some "leave the issue aside with a shrug", which I can understand, Paul van
Oyen places this matter in a broader perspective.
Please take good notice of his letter and remember that the subject is NOT
really Shankara's birthdate.
It is all about a-dvaita and about nivritti THROUGH pravritti.

Rob van Dijk.
