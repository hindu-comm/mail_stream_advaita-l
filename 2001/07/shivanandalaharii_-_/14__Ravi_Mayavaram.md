There is a nice commentary in Sanskrit by an anonymous author. He
refers to himself as shiva-bhakta.

First I had an hunch about this after seeing  some sanskrit notes in
aNNaa's shivaanandalaharii book which has word by word meaning in Tamil
and some foot notes. aNNaa did not give any reference or author info
for the sanskrit quotes. Initially I was wondering whether it is
aNNaa's work (by the way, aNNaa is subrahmaNya aiyar, not politician
aNNaa), but later concluded against it.  About aNNaa, His translations
are brief and to the point. He is great scholar as well, once kAnchi
paramAchaarya remarked that he is indeed aNNa (leader, elder) of the
world of vedAnta.


The entire Tiika and a very nice Hindi commentary is available in the
book by shrii shrii svayamprakaashananda giri. Hindi commentary by the
author has very nice and appropriate quotations from various different
works.
