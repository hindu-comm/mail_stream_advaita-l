>From the E mail address I suppose and understand that this E mail is
addressed directly to His Holiness Svarupananda Sarasvati, Shankaracarya.

First of all I should wish to pay my respects to the Holy Pitha of Dvaraka
and to the ancient tradition which is being manifested in this Seat.

Secondly I should wish to express my great disappointment when I note that
the Dvaraka Pitha has apparently decided to support the Kanci claims of
Shankara's birthdate around 500 BC.I am, of course, aware that this issue is
a western problem and that in the Indian view time is irrelevant in
spiritual matters. However, we are living in an increasingly more
westernized world and we have to take into account what current thinking
patterns are.

No doubt the learned men of Dvaraka pitha are aware of the book published by
BHISHMA, Bombay under the editorship of S.D. Kulkarni. This book proclaims
the pre-eminence of Kanci Pitha and the birth date of Adi Shankara around
500 BC.
This book has been officially denounced by the Indian Government when it
joined officially the 12th Centenary celebrations of Adi Shankara's
birth-day in 1988. For reference purposes I also refer to the book by V.Raj
Gopal Sharma Ã„charya Sri Shankara's Advent"

It is a great pity that even on such simple and not very important matters
as Shankara's birth-date the four Pitha's cannot come to unanimity. This is
very bad for the credibility of the Ancient Wisdom which is protected and
promulgated by the four pitha's.

May I urgently request Your Holiness to look into this matter and make a
real effort to come to unanimity amongst the three living acarya's of the
four pitha's.

Thirdly I find it a matter of great pity that until today the most damaging
dissent in Jyotir Matha and the succession is still not solved. I am much
aware that the root problem lies with self-styled Mahesh Yogi who is now
living in exile in Holland with is TM movement. Still the inability by the
very guardians of the ancient tradition to solve this serious problem in a
wise and yet practical manner is beyond an ordinary person's comprehension.
I understand that the previous acarya of Shringeri HH Shri Abhinava
Vidyathirta has made a valuable attempt to come to a kind of solution
involving - amongst others - the succession at Dvaraka Pitha.

Again it would appear to me that urgent consultations are needed to come to
a succession at Jyotir Matha as soon as possible with the agreement of the
three functioning acarya's.

I sincerely hope that Your Holiness allows me to bring these comments and
remarks to your attention by placing them at the lotus feet of the Holiness.

Respectfully yours,
Dr Paul G. van Oyen
