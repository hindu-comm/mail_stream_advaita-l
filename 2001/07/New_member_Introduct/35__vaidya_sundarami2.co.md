Dear Vaidya Sundaram,

    I am a student of BITS, Pilani, hailing from Chennai. For long, I have
nurtured an interest in Adhvaitha and the practices of Smartas. For a
period, I also studied the Gita Bhashya and Upanishad Bhashyas from Dr
Krishnamurthy Sastrigal, principal, madras sanskrit college. I would love
to be a part of your list and to contribute whatever little I can to the
discussions going on.

Yours,
Ganesh R
