Dear Members,
   I would like to know what is the advaitic explanation to
the various incarnations of Lord Vishnu.. I don't have access
to Sankara's Gita Bhashyam.. I request scholar members to
explain Sankara's explanations of the Gita verse beginning as
"parithrANAya sAdhUnAm".

   Thanks in advance.
   chandrasekaran.
