But you can distinguish between the two telephones or eggs only because
there exists a definite boundary for them, and there's a region of "non-
telephone" or "non-egg" between them. On the other hand, if only existence
exists, and non-existence cannot exist, then even if there were two
identical "existence"s, for all practical purposes, we wouldn't be able to
distinguish between them, would we?
