namaste,

>>at least that's the way the MahAnArAyaNa upanishad has it. Perhaps what
>>you have is from another source?

I think that's possibly the case. The MahAnArAyaNa upanishad has only
around 11 hymns of this type, starting off with rudra, and ending
with durgA. I've heard similar hymns to other devatAs also, so probably
there're other sources in the vedas for similar hymns. Or maybe just for the
purposes of worship (and not as part of reciting the vedas), similar hymns
could be composed and chanted for other devatAs too?

>>It is "gaNaanaam tva gaNapatiM havamahe..."

yes, and in the krishna yajurveda, it is pronounced as gaNapatigum and not
gaNapatiM, though probably written the latter way.
