The reason I brought this up is that it shows Advaita Vedanta is not
idealistic (from a philosophical point of view) but realistic in the sense
that there are "things" out there.  The problem is they are misunderstood
not that they are figments of the imagination.  These leads to a two-tier
level of truth.  There is a vyavaharic or pratibhasika satya and there is
paramarthika satya.

What this means for the sadhaka is it seems not to be enough to "know" one
must also be aware of at what level one knows.  How is this to happen?
For instance how does realizing that the snake is really a rope help you
realize the rope is really Brahman?  And how to know if Brahman is not
just an adhyasa on to something else?  Potentially there is an infinite
regress here.  The answer I think is this is where anubhava comes in.
After Brahman one "sees" there is nothing left as a basis for
superimposition.

Yes and I do believe what you are saying is the authentic Vedantic
position.  But what needs to be clarified now is how one should arrive at
the conclusion that a thing is real or needs further deconstruction.
