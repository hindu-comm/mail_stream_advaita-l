Ajativada is described by Gaudapadacharya.  drshtisrshtivada by the
relatively modern author Prakashananda Yati and the srshtidrshtivada by
most of the authors in between.  There is a book called
Vedantaprakriyapratyabhijna by Swami Sacchidanandendra Saraswati which
compares the views of various authors.  The authors view is that the
Ajativada is the true Advaitic stance and the other theories were brought
in to defend Advaita Vedanta against rivals but unnecessarily add
complications.  From what I've read so far, he seems to make a compelling
case but I'm still working my way through it.

It's a subject I still need to learn more about myself.  By idealism I
mean the idea that apparently perceived objects are only essentially
mental constructs.  The problem is if the perceived universe is all in the
mind, it is a rather strange coincidence that for example a couple of
hundred widely dispersed people of different kinds and walks of life
should all be hallucinating advaita-l at the same time!  Anandagiri
mentions this in the context of Shankaracharyas criticism of the
Vijnanavada Buddhists.  Nand referred to this too.  Realism on the other
hand refers to the idea that objects exist independently of a perceiver.

If we accept what I call the idealistic view, my statement is pointless.
However if we accept the realistic view, mithyatva becomes a more complex
thing with multiple levels.

I guess this is what I'm still having doubts on.  I'll look for statements
in the shastras concerning this.
