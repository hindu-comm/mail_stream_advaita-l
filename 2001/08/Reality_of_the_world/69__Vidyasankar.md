I have been following the discussion with some interest, as it hones
in on one of the key issues in Vedanta.

According to classical Advaita, I believe the relationship between
"thing out there" and "mind" needs to be revised and restated as
follows. Fundamentally, the "thing out there" cannot be established
independent of the perceiving consciousness, while the "mind" is the
instrument by means of which the perceiving consciousness perceives.
Both the mind and the external object are part of the indeterminate
problem.
