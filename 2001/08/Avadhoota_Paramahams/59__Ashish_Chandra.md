I disagree a little Jaldhar. You have already read the Jivanmuktiviveka. In
it you will find that even though Rishi Yajnavalkya had already attained
jnana, he still took vidvat sannyasa. You will notice how Sri Vidyaranya
describes this i.e. why should a jnani take vidvat sannyasa at all. I will
look up the reference and post tomorrow but you can look it up if you like.
