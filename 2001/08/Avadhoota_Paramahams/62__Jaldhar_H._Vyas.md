Ok, it seems we actually agree on this topic.  A sannyasi is a sannyasi.
The difference between a vividisha and a vidvana is that the latter has
reached his goal and the former hasn't yet.

In the case of a householder who achieves jnana, sannyasa also
automatically follows.  Not to fulfill some ideological requirement but
because he is no longer interested in the affairs of the world.  Imagine
some person get jnana and the next day goes to his bos and says "I am
indifferent to profit and loss."  How long would he last before getting
fired?  Or if he said to his wife and children, "I regard you the same as
a cat's and dogs."  How long would that marriage last?  If you have truly
achieved jnana you will end up becoming a sannyasi whether that was your
intention or not!
