Looking at the Jivanamuktiviveka again, I did make one error in my
presentation.  Even the paramahamsa might only be a vividisha not a
vidvan.  In other words, all jivanamuktas are paramahamsas but all
paramahamsas are not necessarily jivanamuktas (yet.)

I think I know which reference you are talking about.  Please post so we
can discuss it.
