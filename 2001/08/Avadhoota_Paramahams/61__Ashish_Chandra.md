Translation: Thus [in previous chapter] Jivanmukti, along with its nature,
evidence, means and purpose has been defined. Now, vidvat-sannyAsa which is
subservient to jivanmukti is being defined. And vidvat-sannyAsa has been
set forth in the Paramhamsa Upanishad, and quoting the same Upanishad, we
[Swami Vidyaranya and the parampara he follows] shall explain.

[ Quoted from Jivanmukti Viveka of Swami Vidyaranya translated by Swami
Mokshananda, Advaita Ashram Press ]

The chapter goes on to describe the defects present in the kevala-yogi and
kevala-paramhamsa saying that the first could get attached to occult powers
that come with yoga practice, and the latter transcends all injunctions and
prohibitions "due to abundance of Brahman knowledge". However, the yogi-
paramahamsa is one who always dwells in the Self alone. It is for becoming
a yogi-paramhamsa, who ever dwells in Atman, that vidvat sannyas is
prescribed.
