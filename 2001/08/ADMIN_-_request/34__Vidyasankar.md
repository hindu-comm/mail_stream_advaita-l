To those users who use hotmail accounts or other web-browser based
email accounts -

If you are using Internet Explorer as your web-browser, when you reply
to an email, please turn off the tool that says "Rich-Text Editor ON".
You will know if you have turned it off - the toolbar that shows icons
inside the answering window should disappear.

The reason I am requesting this is that the RTF editor adds HTML tags
to the text that you send out as a post. This makes it impossible to
read on any other email program that does not decipher HTML tags. It
also creates a little problem for our archives.

E.g. check http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l.html for
the first week of August, and you will see that some posts are archived
as plain text (easy to read) and others are full of HTML tags (difficult
to read). If HTML tags are present, the sentences just run forever, and
a break occurs only for a new paragraph. This makes it very difficult to
view on any computer screen.

Thanks,
Vidyasankar Sundaresan
