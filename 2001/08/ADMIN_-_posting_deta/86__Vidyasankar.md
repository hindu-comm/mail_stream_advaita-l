Dear list members,

Please send your posts intended for the entire list to the address
<advaita-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org>.

Please do not address posts to <advaita-l at advaita-vedanta.org> or to
<listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org>. The former will lead to bouncing of
emails, while the latter should be used only for administrative details
to be taken up by one of the list moderators.

Thanks,
Vidyasankar

Vidya - unfortunately when you press the reply button what shows up
in the address list is <ADVAITA-L at ADVIATA-VEDANTA.ORG> and not
advaita-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org as indicated in this replay post.
I have to copy the address <advaita-l at lists.advaita.vedanta.org
separately and past it.  I think you  may have to change the reply
field if you want the replays to intended address.  We may end up
with two posts of this if both fields work. Thanks.
Sada
