Yes, Aniruddhan also drew my attention to it yesterday. In the archives
at http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l.html, the Reply To
field shows up correctly! There seems to be a bug somewhere in the list
software. Jaldhar is trying to fix it at his end soon. In the meantime,
please make sure that posts are addressed only to

advaita-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org .

Thanks,
Vidyasankar
