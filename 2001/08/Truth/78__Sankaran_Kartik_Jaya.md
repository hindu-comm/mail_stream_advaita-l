If I remember right, Shankara says that the very fact that
Satyakama spoke the truth implies that his ancestry could
only have been BrAmhaNa! This means that all persons who 
speak the truth must necessarily be of BrAmhaNa parentage.
Please note that this doesn't mean that all those who are
of BrAmhaNa parentage shall speak the truth.

I know it is a little :-), but I must check this out with 
in Shankara's BSB 1.3.36-38.
