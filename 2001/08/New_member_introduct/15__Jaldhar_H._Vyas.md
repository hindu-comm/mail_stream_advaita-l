There is a sociologival explanation too.  As I mentioned in a previous
psot, Swami Vivekanada is an icon of modernity in Indian culture.  By
invoking his name, the ashram is telling its' audience, "Look we are
traditional but we are not backward."

I think he has a good point.  The upanishads and other mokshashastras
provide the raw material for Vedantic philosophy but through the process
of Mimamsa (debate, logical and linguistic analysis) it was refined and
systemized.  In the Brahmasutras, Maharshi Badarayana often quotes the
views of other Rshis.  However he doesn't always accept them as siddhanta.

I'm not satisfied with that answer.  Instead I would say the adhikara for
study of a particular shastra is a different subject from adhikara for
inquiry into Brahman.  One does not imply the other.  The reason one
should study the shastras is because we are under three debts, to the Devas
which we fulfill through puja etc., to the Pitrs which is fulfilled by
having children and continuing the family, and most pertinent in this
case, to the Rshis which is fulfilled by study.  The study of shastras, by
eliminating ignorance provides the condition in which it is possible to
know Brahman, however that knowledge is not *caused* by the shastras.

Has He though?  One of the major causes of confusion in interpretation of
the Bhagavadgita is that there are two teachings going on.  One is
Bhagawans message to humanity, universally valid for all times and
places.  And the second is His message to one particular person, Arjuna,
in one particular time and place, Kurukshetra on the eve of war.  Many
systems of ethics religious and secular come to grief by misjudging the
relationship between the universal and the particular.

At the beginning, it is Arjuna who is making all the right Vedantic
noises.  He is the one who wants to renounce fame and fortune.  But
Krishna Bhagawan knows this is more based on cowardice than a real feeling
of vairagya.  The beauty of the Gita is it not only explains how and when
to practice Vedanta but how and when *not* to practice it.  There are
situation when pravrtti is more important than nivrtti.  It is essential
to know exactly when.

It is true that it is the Advaitins who are the most radical in rejection
of karma.  Other sampradayas combine karma and jnana to lesser or greater
extent.  But in a way we are saving karma from itself.  Actions have to be
done from time to time but when action becomes an end to itself, it has a
tendency to become harmful rather than good.
