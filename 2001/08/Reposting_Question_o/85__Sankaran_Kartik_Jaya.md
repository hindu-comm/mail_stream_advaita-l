Easy. There's GItA 10.20.

Here's what Ramana Maharshi has to say on this subject:

---------------
"I, O Arjuna! am the Self, seated in the heart of all beings;..." Bhagavad
Gita, X-20. The stanza shows that the Lord is the Atma (Self) of all
beings. Does it say, "the Self of the selves"? If, on the other hand, you
merge in the Self there will be no individuality left. You will become the
source itself. In that case what is surrender? Who is to surrender what
and to whom? This constitutes devotion, wisdom, and investigation.
