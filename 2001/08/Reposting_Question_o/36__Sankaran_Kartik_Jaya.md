By saying that the JIva-Ishvara duality is only at the conventional
(vyAvahArika) level of reality. Here, the Lord incarnates to "take good
care" of the living beings. In the ultimate (pAramArthika) level, they are
one.

Shankara's commentary on this verse is one line long. He simply says that
the Lord incarnates to protect the good people.

I thought I would go back two verses to see how Shankara comments on that.
Here, Shankara says that even though the Lord does not take birth, he
seems to do so by his inscrutable power of becoming.
