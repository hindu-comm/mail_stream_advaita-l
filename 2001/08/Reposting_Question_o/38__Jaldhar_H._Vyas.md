Again sorry for the delayed response.

The difference is that even if they were outwardly looking at a
murti of Vishnu Bhagawan what they actually perceived was nothing other
than the imperishable atman.

Have YOU tried killing an asura lately? :-)

The difference is we are afflicted by avidya and the burdens of our karma.
Even the jivanmukta must ride out the last remnants of his prarabdha
karma.  But Bhagawan only appears to be bound by karma and avidya.  Why
the necessity for such disguise?  Arjuna may have been a sadhupurusha but
he wasn't perfect.  He asked Krishna Bhagawan to show his Vishwarupa but
when he actually saw it he was stricken by terror and begged Bhagawan to
return to the form of his childhood friend.

In the ultimate sense it isn't true.  Because from the highrest standpoint
there is no birth and death.
