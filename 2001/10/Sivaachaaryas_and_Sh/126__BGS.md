DayAtvatyA dattam dravidasishurAsvAdy tava yat

The scholars who contend that Sankara was born in
788 A.D have taken the third word Dravidasishu-
in the above line, as a reference to Sambandar.

According to A.Kuppuswami, who has edited and
published  the Soundaryalahari with ten noted
commentaries,there are about 32 commentaries
on the Soundaryalahari alone.The Commentators like
Lakshmidhara,kaivalyashrama,Kameswarasuri,Anandagiri,
Nrisimhasrama,and many others take the word to mean
Sankara only. In Akhandanandas Kaivalyavardhani
gloss which is more than three centuries old
Dravidasishu is interpreted as I Sankaracarya,
son of a Dravida brahmana.

V.Rajgopal Sharma,in his book ACHARYA SANKARAS
ADVENT (published by the Kaladi Sankara Math,
in 1992) states Several hymns have
been published in the name of Acharya Sankara.
Most of them are not the compositon of Acarya
Sankara
Soundaryalahari is a composition of
another Sankaracarya of the same lineage.
The authorship of Soundaryalahari is doubtful.

It is not known on what source modern historians
have based their identification of Dravidasishu
with Tirgnanasambandar
