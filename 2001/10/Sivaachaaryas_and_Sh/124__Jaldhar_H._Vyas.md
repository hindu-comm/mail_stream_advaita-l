Possibly because it was Advaitic?  (Although not Vedantic.)
The silence is curious indeed.  Sureshwaracharya did criticize it in his
works.

In the digvijayas a story is mentioned about how Abhinavagupta the famous
Kashmiri Shaiva put a curse on Shankaracharya.  Padmapadacharya turned the
curse back onto him and he died.

I don't quite understand what exactly you mean by "pastoralist" here.  Can
you clarify?  As to the choice of targets, perhaps (I'm only guessing
here) the only alternatives to one are zero and more than one.  Once
you've disposed of the idea of two principles, three, four, five...
require no further comment.
