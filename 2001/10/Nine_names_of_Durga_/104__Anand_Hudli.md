After a ChanDI homa during this navarAtrI, I was left wondering what
the name of devI's lion could be. The lion, as a vehicle of the devI,
is mentioned several times in the devI mAhAtmya but not by any particular
name. Just as ViShNu has GaruDa, and Shiva has nandI, pray tell us
what the name of the divine lion of the devI is.
