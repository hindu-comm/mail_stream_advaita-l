*sigh* another mistake, name number 8 was left out.

8.  Mahagauri --  "Great Golden One"

Once Shiva Bhagawan jokingly compared His body which is pale because of
the ashes that cover it and because ofthe Moon which He wears as a hair
ornament, to Kali Matas' dark skin.  She got offended and went to do tapa
by which She became golden-skinned.  This illustrates that opposites like
light and dark are actually aspects of the same thing.  In fact in some
versions of the story, the body that Kali Mata obtains is not only golden
but the mirror image of Shiva Bhagawan Himself which further underscores
the message of non-duality.
