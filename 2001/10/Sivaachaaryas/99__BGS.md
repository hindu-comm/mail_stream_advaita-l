The Arunachala Mahatmyam of Skandapurana declares  only five of the twenty
eight Agamas lead to the path of liberation - the Kalamukha,Kankala, Saiva,
Pasupata and Mahavrata.  The (28)Agamas followed by the Adisaivas are not
included in the above list. They come under the Saiva Agama group. The
Lagulagama comes under the Pasupata Agama group.

The Pallava Kings who actively supported/patronised the Pasupata sect,
belonged to the Bharadvaja Gotra. According to Vamana Purana, Bharadvaja
was the preceptor of the Pasupatas. Mahapasupata is described as the form
of Siva who incarnated himself  as Bharadvaja for the propagation of the
Pasupata doctrine.

Ananta Sivacarya of Kuram and Yagna Bhatta of Srikattupalli (Ref. Kuram and
Velurpalayam Copper Plates) might have also been the followers of this sect.

Vamana Purana describes of a war between Siva and Asuras. Siva was
supported by the Mahapasupatas and others. Siva extended special welcome to
Mahapasupatas because they did not recognize a distinction between him and
Vishnu. Even today We can see images of Vishnu and his consorts in the
temples erected by the Mahapasupatas.

Vamana Purana also states Apastamba was the Teacher of the Kalamukha
doctrine. An incomplete record from Vedal, in North Arcot District,
mentions a Kalamukha Dasapriyan of the Harita Gotra and Apastamba Sutra.

Kalamukhas were also called as Asita-vaktras (Black face). A 10th Century
A.D inscription of Kodumbalur registers a grant made for feeding fifty
Asita-vaktra ascetics every day. One Mallikarjuna of Atreya Gotra, a pupil
of Vidyarasi and Taporasi was the priest of the Temple (Vimanatrayam 
Moovarkoil).
