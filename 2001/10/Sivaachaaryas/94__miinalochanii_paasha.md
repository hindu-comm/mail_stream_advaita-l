My understanding was that they are a class of brahmins and  only they
can become the temple priests of shiva temples in TN. They are not
shaiva veLLaala-s. But they are shaiva-s and not smarta-s like rest of
the aiyars. As paramacharya says they are indeed brahmana-s at least at
social standing.

But there are some hidden social tensions in relationships between them
and aiyars in marriage etc. If I am not mistaken, aiyars consider them
slightly at a lower level than them on social standing. Also they not
do not give that great a status to shankarAchArya-s like aiyar-s. (this
para may be wrong).

 I did a www search and following is from the book "Dancing with Siva"
written by shivAya subramuniyaswami who belongs to shaiva siddhanta
tradition. This is to support my first paragraph, my second para may be
wrong. Long ago I tried to find something about this as my nADi
predicted that I will become a temple priest in my next birth. Which
reminds me of my friend's comment (from R.K. Narayanan) "that most
indians plan elaborately for next birth, forgetting the current" :-))
or something to that effect.


I hope this answers Nandakumar's question.
