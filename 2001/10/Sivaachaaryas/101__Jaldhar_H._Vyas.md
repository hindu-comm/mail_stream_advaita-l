Perhaps it is by adoption?  Jain monks also have a system of "gotras"
I'm told (Not based on Brahman Rshis as you can imagine) and in their case
it obviously cannot be by birth.  On initiation, they join the "gotra" of
their guru.  Perhaps it is the same way with the "new" Brahmans.  When
they began learning the Vedas, they took up the gotras of their teachers.

In Gujarat at least there doesn't seem to be such functional seperation
nor even by sampradaya as you see in the South.
