Yes, it certainly does make any reader skeptical.

Nevertheless, it should be cause for concern. Christian missionaries have
always set their eyes on converting the "lower caste" members of Hinduism,
and have never kept this a secret. Christianity is, after all, a highly
politically motivated religion, and even sober analysts are of the opinion
that the dalits can be easily converted.

You can visit http://www.inwave.com/~webmastr/ChronAug1999View.htm

"Even in India, a land soon to surpass China in population, a staggering
one-fifth of the population are Dalits, the so-called Untouchables, who
represent a very fertile field for organized evangelism by any major faith
with the will to reach them: Will that be Islam or Christianity?"

I hope something can be done to make the dalits feel pride in belonging to
a rich religious tradition that can help them spiritually. If not, I
believe it is in their own best interest to embrace a religion that will.

I was only trying to help in a constructive exchange of views :-)
