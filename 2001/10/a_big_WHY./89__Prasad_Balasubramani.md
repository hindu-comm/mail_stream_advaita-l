Thanks to all for clarifying my question on Karma.

Why did Bhagawan create this world ? Why did He choose to create varieties
of living organisms over millions of years ?Why did he decide to have these
Devas, Asuras, Manushyas, Dharma, Adharma , pancha Bhoothaas,cycles of
Yugas, His ten avathaars ? Why did he create the concepts of good bad,
thrigunas, and every single thing that exists today ?  Why did he decide to
keep one organism to be Manushya with ability to think and rationalize only
to ultimately know Him and get back to Him ? Why didnt he opt to let a
Jeevathma not take up any jenma at all ?  Why shouldnt He have not opted to
continue being Him without doing all these that too in cycles ?
