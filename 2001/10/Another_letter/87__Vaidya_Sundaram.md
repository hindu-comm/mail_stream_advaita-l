 I enquired about this to some scholars back home and I was told that
Durga Herself is the presiding deity of Agni. So, when one address
Agni, one is actually addressing Durga.
 I do not have the details of why they draw such a conclusion, but when
enquired I was told that in the Devi Mahatmiyam She is referred to
being identical with Agni in some cases, and in other cases, being the
deity for Agni.

 I am sending this note so that we are not confused as to whether we
are doing something wrong; we are still right in chanting the Durga
suktam as we know it for Sri Durga.
