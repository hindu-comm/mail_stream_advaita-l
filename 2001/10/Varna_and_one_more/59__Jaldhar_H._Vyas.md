Anyone who has spent even five minutes in India knows that ones caste is
based on birth.  That this is even an issue shows how bogus it is to rely
on books, ignoring the evidence in front ones own eyes.

An example of this from the Shruti that comes to mind is there is a
certain rite which is supposed to be performed by a rathakara
(chariot-maker.)  The sages asked does this mean a person who follows
the profession of chariot making or someone who belongs to the caste of
chariotmakers?  The answer is the latter.  We recently discussed the story
of Satyakama and that all acharyas have interpreted Brahmanhood to be a
matter of birth in his case not deeds.

>From very early on, thinkers have realized the connection between varna
and jati is problematic.  One theory mentioned in the Dharmashastras is
that the various jatis are the result of varnasankara (or mixture of the
varnas.)  But again, this doesn't accord very well with reality.
