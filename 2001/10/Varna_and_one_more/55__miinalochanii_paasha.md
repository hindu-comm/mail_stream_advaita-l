varNa is not caste. jAti is caste. From the name jAti  (jA) it is
clearly associated with birth.

There are two kinds of dharma: sAmAnya and visheshha. The book hindu
dharma is online on kamakoti.org explains it very well. Please read it.
Personally, I think it is extremely difficult to be a brahmaNa
according to the traditional way. At least I see no hope. My conviction
increases as I read pages from vaidyanAtha dIxitIyam (which puts
together the views of various smRti-s and veda) on different subjects
related to visheshha dharma.

These days I think of only of a simple rule. This is extremely
difficult as well. This is the view of saint thiruvaLLuvar. It is very
brief and precise. My translation does not do it justice. I use tamil
commentary by parimelazagar as reference (who treats it mostly from
vedic stand point).

anthaNar enbor aRavOr - maRRevvuyirkkum
chenthaNmai puuNDozhugalan

brAhmaNa is one who adheres to dharma (which is chiefly) acting towards
welfare of all beings.


anthaNar - brahmaNa (literally one who has beautiful qualities or one
who is beautiful inside: azhagiya thaTpam uDaiyOr)

enbOr - those who

aRavOr - those who adhere to dharma

maRRevvuyirkum - to all other beings

chenthaNmai - considering welfare (chemmai thaNmai), compassionate

puuNDu - adopting (clothing oneself)

ozhugalaan - living by.


1) Considering welfare need not always mean ahimsa. Sometimes you have
to punish someone to help them learn. It is like taking a bitter
medicine to treat a disease.


2) This definition is actually placed in the section of renunciates. I
think it is appropriate. To be a brahmaNa (by any standards) require
ENORMOUS sacrifice.


vaLLuvar is actually an authority on sAmAnya dharma (he does not touch
upon visheshha dharma). But I am fascinated by this verse (like many of
his other verse).

BTW we do plan to start a series on vaidyanAtha diixitiyam on this
list.

My 2c.
