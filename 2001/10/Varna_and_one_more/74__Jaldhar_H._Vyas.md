I don't know where you got the idea anyone was trying to discourage or
doubting sincerity.  If that were the case noone would have said anything
because the insincere never listen or understand.  The pertinence of this
topic I understand (and the reason it does popup again and again) is not
*whether* one should seek but *how*.  Advaita Vedanta is not just a
theory but a practical method for mukti.  The Rshis did not show us a goal
so we could stumble aimlessly toward it.

All thinking, conscious beings have the potential to recognize the
paramatma within them.  However the methods they use to achieve that must
be different because they are different.
