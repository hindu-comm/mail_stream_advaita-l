Dear Vaidya,
This reply kept bouncing back this morning so I am
trying again but apologise for the brief reply.

In this discussion maybe and these discussions are
'liked'. However may we note that at the moment we
perceive the snake, the rope, the ropeness and the
substratum of them all, all are also present. Whatever
needs to be known, realised, is available in every
action: " He who knows action in inaction etc....".
These discussions take place through this wonderful
medium of the Web and the sincere efforts of the site
organisers. Intention, tatparya, is important in the
mind of the writer and reader for this will establish
the 'level' of observation. Every moment, every
sentence, every action has its 'atha'and  'iti' points
and these allow us to 'get out of the way', to clear
the vision.  Fundamentally there is:
'athaato brahmajijn~aasaa'  ( sorry if the
transliteration is wrong but I must give some some
time to learning it properly) whether we are
exchanging these e-mails, digging the garden or
hosting parties..the latter two I 'do not
like'.....all possibilities are there in potential.
I agree that we confuse the vyavaharika and
paramartika when focussing on the topic under
discussion but isn't it great that these conversations
are taking place so openly and there is a forum for us
to expose and shed our ignorance before such a large
audience?
Om sri ram
