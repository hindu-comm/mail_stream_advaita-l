 I would not concur - while there is no reason to suppose that all of
science in also present in the vedas, it is also possible there are
references to day to day (or vyavahaarika) science in it (the Vedas).
There is I think, as Shrinivas says, a possibility of overlap between
the two.
 One difficulty in the process of finding such an overlap is that one
does not have easy access to all the vedic mantras, partly because they
were "lost" and not available any more.

 It is only the "validity" of the vedic teachings that is questioned in
vyavahaarika when it apparently contradicts common knowledge. But that
does not preclude the possibility of vedas being able to confirm common
scientific knowledge. As I understand it, Shrinivas is trying to
collect such commonality ...

 In a sense, one must definitely be cautius about drawing parallels
between concepts like "energy of science = prana of the vedas". We have
to keep in mind that the classification of observed phenomena in the
vedas in NOT the classification seen today. Let me give you an example
as I see it - agni is said to have smoke as his chariot. His inherent
manifestation is with seven forks in his body, light and heat are his
skin etc - these "energies" are hence classified in vedas as His
"shaktis" - but, if you look at it from a 10,000 feet level, they are
talking of a physical manifestation of the energy of fire - while some
might consider it sacrilege to even contemplate bringing the Gods down
to physical levels, I think enquiry in any form into the truths behind
vedic teachings is good, and can potentially lead one to the REAL
TRUTH. What that is, I don't know and only take for granted from the
teachings of acharyas - ....

 Postulating the existence does not mean proof right? So, what is wrong
in postulating such an existence? Perhaps the unifying framework will
turn out to be paramartika satyam - the attempt to unify vedic
knowledge and common science into a framework should not be taken an
end in itself, but should, in my opinion, be taken as a step to
understanding our "observed" world, and going from there into
understansding what is not obviously seen but only spoken of, namely,
Brahman.

 just my 2 cents!
