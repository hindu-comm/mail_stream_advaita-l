Actually, we don't need to do this at all. If we are looking to understand
the "Truth", namely, Atman/Brahman, then we can do so only through the
Vedas, and science is useless in this regard, especially since the basic
inputs for science are sensory data, and Brahman is super-sensory. On the
other hand, for empirical truths, vedas MAY not be of much use, but
science can be useful. We don't have to look for corroboration from each
for the other.
