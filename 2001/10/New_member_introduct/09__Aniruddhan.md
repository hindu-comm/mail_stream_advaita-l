That is true, but why do we need to look for science in the vedas, when
that is not the basic purpose of the vedas? I also have a basic question
about this: If the (sounds of the) Vedas are eternal, are we justified in
looking for vyavaharic/historic/scientific references in them? And when
the vedas have references to day to day science, should we take this to
refer to the scientific knowledge of the vedic people?

Yes, but there are many places where the vedas contradict
common/scientific knowledge and when we interpret the vedas metaphorically
in those contexts, why should we try to confirm scientific knowledge using
the vedas in other places? What I mean is, we know that the vedas
contradict common knowledge in some places. That means that they are
unreliable sources of knowledge (at least unless they are interpreted
properly) as far as scientific/common knowledge is concerned. So how can
we "confirm" scientific knowledge using the vedas?
