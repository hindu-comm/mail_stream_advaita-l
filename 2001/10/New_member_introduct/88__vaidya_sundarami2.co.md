Namaskar,

KshmyataaM for the delay in replying.

I'm Sathya Jambunathan, currently working in Boston, US.

I was introduced to your group by Eshwar Prasad
Balasubramaniam who is also a member of the group.

I am interested to learn more about the Advaita
Siddhanta, in our Sanatana Vaidic Dharma.

Namaste

Sathya
