Namaste Shri Aniruddhan,

Why should we assume that science and Vedas are non-overlapping.
I tend to think that science should (in some sense) be a subset
of vedic teachings.

As an example, we talk of energy, say energy associated with
the electromagnetic force. Vedic approach would however refer
to Prana and insist that any physical energy necessarily has
to be a manifestation of Prana. Thus Prana must be some generalized
version of energy. If one reads more about the Vedic descriptions
of Prana, one is convinced, that Prana transends the physical
plane itself. At the same time, Vedas remind us that every
event in the physical plane is mobilised by Prana. So there must
be some connection between the physical energy (which falls in the
domain of physics) and Prana - a concept that is so central in vedic
literature.

Similar concerns motivate a search for an unifying framework.

Best Regards
Shrinivas
