Re: Welcome and Request for more info.

Well allow me to see. My name is Benjamin K. Badgley.
I live in West Virginia of the USA. My interest in
advaita-vedAnta and more generally in advaita stems
from being somewhat a student of Zen. Also I'm a
writer and am learning introspectively of myself
or lack of. I'm here to read mostly and learn.
