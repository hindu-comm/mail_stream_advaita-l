 namaskaram.
  You are right. We cannot confirm the scientific understanding like
this. What I understood of the original idea was to see where they
"match" ***without*** any interpretion of the vedas, or
"reinterpretation of science" ; my motivation was to see how, in the
case of the variations, there are different kinds of interpretations of
the vedas, and what these different kinds of interpretations are ...
thats all.
