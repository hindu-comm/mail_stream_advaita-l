Dear All: Namaskar !

This is in response to Shri Sadananda's posting about
the situation in the Mahabharata:

1) A Brahmin is someone whose parents are both
Brahmins or whose father is a Brahmin and mother is a
non-Brahmin but a Dvija (Kshatriya or Vaisya)

Jamadagni's, a Brahmin, parents are Richika (Father -
Brahmin) and Vishwamitra's sister (Mother-Kshatriya)

2)Parashurama and Drona are Brahmins and took to arms
during certain situations, Brahmins could teach
warfare and during times of Aapat-Kaal could
participate in warfare, plus Parashurama is an avatar
of Bhagawan Vishnu.

3)Vishwamitra was entitled to vedic rights as he was a
Kshatriya by birth and through tapas became a Brahmin,
 which isn't easy and quite rare; once he became a
Brahmin, his subsequent descendents were Brahmin by
birth, e.g, members belonging to Kaushik gotra, etc.

4)Veetahavya was a Haiheya King belonging to Atri
gotra and Chandravamshi lineage.  He was one of the
losing parties in the Battle of Ten Kings.  He took
refuge in Brighu's ashram and "became a Brahmin" He
then founded a Brahminical gotra called Vadhula gotra
whose pravara is: Bhargava, Veetahavya, and Savetsa.
By the way I belong to Vadhula gotra. Now he became a
Brahmin to either rebirth or through tapas. Simple
adoption by Brighu doesnt seem plausible as
"genetically" he would be of Atri gotra, and as far as
I know, there is no bar to marriage between members of
Atri gotra and Vadhula gotra.

5)Now Kshatriyas belong to Suryavamshi lineage
(Kashyapa-Surya-Vaiwasvata Manu-Ikshvaku) or
Chandravamshi lineage (Atri-Soma-Budha who married
Vaiwasvata Manu's daughter ILa- Pururvas) or
Agnivamsha (e.g. Chauhan and Pramara/Parmar clans,
created by Vashista's sacrificial fire).  Brahmins
belonging to 40+ gotras are actually descendents of
the following progenitors:
Atri,Brighu,Vashista,Kashyapa,Agastya,Vishwamitra,Angirasa.
Vaisyas supposedly are descended from the same
progenitors.

6)NIYOGA- this is a situation when a Brahmin rsi
maintains the line of the king. e.g. Many evil kings
were killed by Parashurama and left heirless.  The
Brahmin rsis continued the lineage with the widowed
queens; the subsequent offspring were Kshatriyas
belonging to the vamsha of the "slain king", but
different gotra as per their natural father.  Hence
that is why many Kshatriyas have similar gotras as
Brahmins. According to Sri Chandrasekhara Saraswati
Swamigal of Kanchi Mutt (in Hindu Dharma section at
www.kamakoti.org); niyoga was self-less service and is
banned in Kaliyuga, as this quality of being selfless
is rare.  Note this is different than anuloma vivaha
as Niyoga wasnt a marriage.  This is how Dhrtarashtra,
Pandu, and Vidura were sired by Veda-Vyasa and
explains their varna.

7)Sambhandam- was a relationship, not marriage between
a male of a higher caste and female of a lower caste
and the offspring were of the maternal caste. e.g.; in
Kerala, many Nambudiri Brahmin males had sambandham
relationships with Sudra Nayar women.

8)The birth of Veda-Vyasa was very unique and
extra-ordinary and it doesnt mean that the offspring
of Brahmin males and fisherwomen would be Brahmins,
infact they would be Sudras.  Besides satyavati was
genetically a Kshatriya adopted by a fisherman.

9)Other species also are apparently also have Brahmin
varnas, e.g. Ravana (Rakshasha) and Astika (son of
Brahmin male and Naga < serpentine tail and a "human
torso"> female.

10)King Bharata (not Shri Ramachandra's brother)
subjected all of his evil sons to the death penalty.
He adopted a descendent of Bhradvaj gotra (progenitor
is Angirasa), done through a special yagna -  not mere
adoption,  to continue the succession. His son in turn
was Bhuvamanyu. Bhuvamanyu's eldest son Brhatksatra
continued as a Kshatriya and the line of succession.
The other sons were Brahmins and founded Brahminical
gotras of which Angirasa is the progenitor:

a. Mahavirya whose son Urukasya had a son
Kapi---Kapasya gotra

b. Mahavirya's other sons: Trayyaruna and Puskarin --
Urukasya gotra

c. Nara whose son Sankrit -- Sankriti Gotra

d. Garg --- Garg gotra.


Looking forward to responses and comments.

Pranam, Ravi Chandrasekhara
