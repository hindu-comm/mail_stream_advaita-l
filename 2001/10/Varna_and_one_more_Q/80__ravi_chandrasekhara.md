Namaskar to all,

I have heard/heard that a Brahmin by birth is defined
as :

1. One born of both parents being Brahmin by birth

2. Brahmin as a result of an anuloma vivaha wher the
father is a Brahmin and the mother is a Kshatriya or
Vaisya by birth.  The mother may be either a second
(Kshatriya) or third wife (Vaisya) of a Brahmin or
possibly even a primary and possibly only a wife
(Kshatriya or Vaisya) e.g. Parashurama's father was
Jamadagni, a Brahmin rsi, and his mother was Renuka, a
Suryavamshi Kshatriya from Ayodhya.

3.Apparently progeny of a Brahmin male and a
Non-dvija/Harijan/Mlecha (used to describe a
"foreigner") apparently are not Brahmins and are
either Sudras or of the mother's caste.

4. But what about Thai and Balinese Brahmins:  They
appear to be descendents of Brahmin males from India
and local women of those lands; then how can they be
Brahmins birth according to the Dharma-Shastras ?

I want to know from anyone what the Dharma-Shastras
say about the above-mentioned situations.

Pranam, Ravi Chandrasekhara
5.Pratiloma or hypogamous marriages between Brahmin
females and non-Brahmin males result in progeny who
according to Dharma-Shastras are not Brahmins and may
be Sudras or of the father's caste.
