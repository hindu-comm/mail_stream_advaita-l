If you knew the fundamental basis for the caste system, why didn't you
tell us earlier?  It would have saved a lot of typing! :-)

Without facts, any assertions of what is fundamental is just one persons
word against another and will get us nowhere.  How can we determine the
facts in this situation?  Certainly we can look at the texts themselves.
But as I've mentioned before, this is not necessarily enough.  I maintain
we also need to take a phenomonological approach and look at what our
ancestors actually did as well as what they said.

There are 18 principal smrtikaras as well as sections on Dharma in the
kalpasutras of Apastambha, Bodhayana etc. as well sections in the Puranas.
As well as commentaries on these texts, there are the nibandhas or
compendia which collect all the quotes from dharmashastras and organize
them by topic.

Though atleast theoretically all the texts can be reconciled, different
dharmashastras have been more influential in various parts of India.  In
the west the Yajnavalkyasmrti with the Mitakshara commentary of
Vijnaneshwar, in Bengal the works of Raghunandana Bhattacharya, in South
India the Parasharasmrti with Madhaviyam of Madhavacharya.  The
Vaidyanathadikshitiyam, Dharmasindhu, Nirnayasindhu have also been
mentioned.  The Manvarthamuktavali of Kulluka Bhatta on Manusmrti,
Chaturavargachintamani of Hemadri, the works of Abhinava Vachaspati
Mishra, Kamalakara Bhatta, and Tryambaka Yajvan have also been
been considered authoritative.

The point is there is a voluminous literature on Dharmashastra.
("History of Dharmashastra" by P.V. Kane contains the most thorough
research on this subject.)  All this must be considered when forming an
opinion on the subject.

This cannot be because shastras mention both wicked Brahmans like Ajamila
or Ravana, and virtuous Shudras like Vidura or Ekalavya.  If the varnas
were defined "ethically" and a matter of vaasanas or tendencies, a wicked
Brahman would be an oxymoron.  Rather what the shastras put forth is an
ideal.  A Brahman should be truthful, learned etc.  Throughout history,
the best of them have met the ideal.  Those that fall short of the mark
should at least try.to meet them.

Or rather birth is only one of the conditions.

If one wants to use a "scientific" approach than any evidence which is
dubious or open to question must be held invalid.

Which time?  And as for smrtis not being pramana, our sampradaya is not
called Smarta for nothing.  Also if Yajnavalkyas words in Yajnavalkya
smrti are only for a certain time, why are the same persons words in
Brhadaranyakopanishad not only valid for a certain time?

I don't think you are being a hypocrite at all.  You have realized as all
clear thinkers must that any ideology however grand and elaborate and
pleasing to the mind must in the end be judged by practicality.  Both
universalist and particularist ideologies have merits and problems.
Saying "all people are the same" leads to a more open and peaceful
society but it also leads to alienation and everyone being pulled to an
insipid lowest common denominator.  Saying "people are different" leads to
greater tolerance but can also lead to the neglect of the less fortunate.
No human society has yet to achieve the perfect balance between the two,
the successful ones atleast have got close.

So the people reading this should stop thinking about big ideas like
"casteism" and instead ask themselves "Have I treated the people around me
with love and respect?"  If no, then *you*, not society, not God, have to
make amends.  If yes, you needn't feel the slightest bit guilty in
following the path your ancestors have followed for millenia.
