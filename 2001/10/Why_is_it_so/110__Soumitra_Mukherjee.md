I want to know why it is a custom to use Beshyadar Mrittika ( soil of the door of a prostitute) in worshipping Devi Durga?
While bathing the image of Devi Durga in a mirror soil from the door of a  Mandir or Temple &  the above said soil are used simultaneously!
Why is it so?
If any of the list members can reply with the inner truth, reply to the group please.
Soumitra.
