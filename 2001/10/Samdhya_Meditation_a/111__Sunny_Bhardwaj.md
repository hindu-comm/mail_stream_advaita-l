I studied in an Arya Samaj school in India where we were taught to perform
Samdhya. We did this once a week.

What is the importance of doing Samdhya and how many times must it be
performed daily/weekly?

We were also taught how to perform Agnihotra Havan (we had to learn the
mantras and recite them in exams and also perform the actual ceremony). I
live in the US now and would like to continue doing Havan. Does anyone have
any ideas/suggestions on how I can do this?

Thanks,
Sunny Bhardwaj
