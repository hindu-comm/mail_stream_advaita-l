I meant the former. One of my friends does the latter, by combining the
sankalpam-s. The correct approach is given below.

Even in these days it is not difficult to perform sandhyavandana both
at dawn and dusk. Office goers and other workers may not be at home
during midday. They may perform the madhyahnika (the midday vandana) 2
hours 24 minutes after sunrise that is called "sangava kala".
---------------

I do not do any of these. I simply skip mAdhyAhnika. Once in a while I
feel guilty about my adharmic life style and go to one of the empty
rooms in my office and meditate on gAyAtri for 15 minutes before lunch.

Namaskar,

I have read that locations such as Kroncha dweepa, etc
are actually "planes/or other habitable places " in
celestial space rather than on earth.  This reference
comes from page 517 of "The True History and the
Religion of India" by Swami Prakashanand Sarawati who
is the head of Barsana Dham in Austin, TX and in
Vrindavan, UP, India. Apparently, at one time he was
offered to be the Shankaracharya of Badrinath Math but
declined.
