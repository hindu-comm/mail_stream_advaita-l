I hate to break it to you but the teachings of the Arya Samaj are total
bunk.  They don't have the remotest connection to any sort of astika
tradition.

In advaita-l we are mainly interested in strictly following the teachings
of Advaita Vedanta but even then we can recognize that there are certain
areas where reasonable people can agree to disagree.  We may have issues
with Vaishnavas etc. but we can recognize them as kindred spirits in at
least some ways.  But this is just incredible!  No way, no how even by the
most warped interpretation can you come up with the idea of doing sandhya
once a week.

Sandhavandana is the basic nityakarma that all the dvijas should do.  It
is said three times a day and should be continued from the time of
upanayana until sannyasa or death.

Having seen an Arya Samaj manual on havans, I can assure you that
pitiful exercise has no relation whatsoever to the Vedic agnihotra.

Given a choice between doing an Arya Samaj havan or watching TV my advice
would be to watch TV.
