Dear Sunny,

> In the end, while I've now gotten a lot of information on the
negatives of
> the organization, I still don't know then how to perform the
Sandyha or
> Havan. Maybe someone could help direct.

There is an elaborate description and a word-by-word translation
of sandhyavandanam at
http://www.hindubooks.org/sandhyavandanam/
   There is also a detailed description at
http://www.vishuji.com/sandhya_vandanam.htm
    I hope youÂ´ll find them useful.

Very best wishes
Stig Lundgren
