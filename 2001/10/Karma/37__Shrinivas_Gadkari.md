Say person X while interacting with person Y, performs an action A.
Further suppose that Y perceives the action A negatively. What you
ask is: "What effect, this action A will have on the future experiences
of X ?". (Karma is the collective effect of past thoughts and actions
on the future experiences of the concerned person).

It basically depends on how X perceives the action. On the state of
mind of X. How Y perceives A cannot affect, the karma of X. However
if the perception of Y, influences the perception of X, then in that
case the fact that Y perceived the action negatively will accrue as
a negative karma for X. The amount of negative karma accrued is
related to the amount of influence of Y on X's perception. If X
executes the act A, while being established in the Self, there
is no possibility of accruing negative karma, irrespective of how
Y might perceive the act A. This is in a sense the gist of Gita.
