Ken,
I have one minor question in your view of this.
Why do you feel that placing no judgment presents imbalance?
>From what little I have learned and read of advaita we are
each
seen as perfect in such fashion that the whole accepts both
light and dark. I can't grasp the use of judgment to say
there
is imbalance in this. Perhaps you may explain this to one
willing
to learn. To learn one asks questions or reads what others
ask.
You ask for help, perhaps we both may help each other.
