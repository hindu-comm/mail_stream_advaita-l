Namsate Jaldhar,

Do you mean to say that an action performed while being established in
the Self can in some cases be negative karma ? I disagree on this issue.

Self is the very essence of purity. Contact with Self is the highest
purifying ritual and far far superior to any yajna. If any yajna can
indeed purify, it is only due to the fact that a yajna is an indirect
technique of establishing a contact with the Self. And then it is the
Self that purifies. Once this is recognized, it follows that any action
performed while in contact with the Self cannot possibly need any
futher purification.

Best regards
Shrinivas
