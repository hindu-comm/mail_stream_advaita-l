 The question is independent of perceptions - so, I think the
fundamental premise you are making here is not correct.

 No it does not. Again, perceptions do not matter. Example: A man in
some kind of painfull sickness may want to die. Another cannot just
kill him even out of compassion. There is no question of even motive.
It is wrong. Period.

 Forgive me for asking this so plainly - but where do you get this kind
of idea from - ?? I mean, I have never seen anywhere such an
extrapolation ...!!

 the measure of right and wrong cannot and does not depend on
perceptions and reactions and influences - it is definitely not
relative ... for every yuga, there is an "absolute" yardstick to
measure against - these yard sticks are the dharma shastras and
smritis. The smritis tell us what is right and what is worng and when
these things are true. If you have a doubt, look at the avenues
available in the dharma shastras itself for resolution ... For
reference, look at the archives on this matter, and you will find quite
a few referenes ... look for topics on svadharma.

 What!!!??? I mean, - what are you trying to say?? I don't understand
at all how you can say this ...!!  - look at your equation here -

let us say X is Arjuna - Y is Duryodhana - the act A is killing him. Y
perceived that X doing A to him is bad - and buy your statement above
that has negative karma for X ?? You mean, Arujuna killing Duryodhana
is bad for Arjuna because Duryodhana takes it negatively ... ????
Please make sense!! This is defenitely not in THE Gita!

bhava shankara desikame shanraNam
Vaidya.
