All three accrue negative karma because for one thing all karma is
negative and secondly the end result is the same, the death of the ants.

In fact, this is why Manusmrti says a grhastha has to do panchamahayajnas
every day, to expiate the sin  of killing isects etc. which is inevitable
in day-to-day life.

The karmayoga described in the Gita, is still karma and is inferior to
karmasannyasa.  However it is the path to be taken when karma is
unavoidable as it was for Arjuna.  It is said in the Mahabharata that the
Pandavas did spend some time in Hell for their actions.
