Namaste Raghavendra,

You said it right. I indeed was basing my understanding
on the kosha theory. However instead of defining several
planes of existence, I had bundled up the higher planes of
existence into just one plane that is the mental plane.
The annamaya kosha is equivalent to the physical plane.

Thanks for this clarification. Just in case you know which
upanishad refers to it, it would be helpful. I remember
reading about it in Vivekachudamani.

Best regards
Shrinivas
