Namaste:

I was wondering if any list member might be able to list
possible meanings of the word tantra, also with break-up
into root words.

Since my Sanskrit is weak I need some help here. Here
is a clue, the most probable intended meaning must result
from a break up that can be applied to words mantra, and
yantra to yield acceptable meanings.

Thanks
